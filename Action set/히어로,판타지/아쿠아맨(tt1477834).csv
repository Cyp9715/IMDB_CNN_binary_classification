whats with the 10 out of 10 reviews really sure its probably the best or second best dc justice league era but thats not difficultlike all the other offerings its overblown wooden one dimensional and over reliant on over the top cgias a child i was always a dc fan and i want them more than anything to bring this thing together but marvel have certainly laid down a tough marker for how it should be and dc still havent met that challengethe main thing missing from the film is charm and simplicity sure momoa just about saves the day and i think he can develop into a loved character and the film is a step in the right direction but 10 out of 10 it most certainly isnt,fantasy
if you are a preteen the story may work for you if you have any common sense the bad dialogue and blatant rip off of every scifi and fantasy movie cliche will drive you crazyspecial effects are decent and the story moves along at a decent pace momoa carries the film despite being surrounded by one dimensional characters with digitally botoxed faces i would never watch this movie again,fantasy
i have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score let alone 10 after 20 minutes i have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show but damn this movie is way too dumb character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues jokes feel like they are just out of place but specific moments are created just for them to happen which makes it even more ridiculous there are some really stunning shots but its more of an exception rather than the rulebut the main issue which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer is the fact that its linear as hell there are 0 unpredictable plot twists from the beginning of the movie or even from trailers you for sure know how its going to endalso the mood is unbelievably inconsistent at some points characters are dead serious while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes its not as bad as in justice league but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry facewb u evil corporate idiots stop ruining your movies by trying to be like marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesnt work it just looks like a parody and not a well done one,fantasy
i dont know where the hype for this film comes from because it cant be from the content the dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible silly can be entertaining but it can also just feel stupid the female characters only seem to exist to be conscience because he cant think for himself as hes boring they have no flaws or vices in other words no depth the villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger with a few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective the good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals it is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed a literal riot of colour across the screen i would also say that action is pretty positive the combat is intense and epic overral though i wouldnt reccomend,fantasy
cmon 1010 seriously the director used every action figureaction movie ever created to fight with or against splashing on testosterone the atlantis guards are power rangers the underwater fighter jets are from star wars the battle with other underwater kingdoms looks like a battle from the lord of the rings some personages are a version of the street sharks even godzila had a resurrection moment do you remember the disneys the sword in the stone even the guy name is arthur did you spotted the dinosaurs at jurasic park i only missed a smeagollike scene with the trident my prrrrecioussssah and a very funny scene is watching trying not to fall and looking very scared from the roof of one house in sicily two stories high  when hed just jumped from a plane thousand meters high with no parachute in the desertbut nicole kidman was beautiful as always,fantasy
everything i saw read and heard about before it came out had me convinced it wouldnt be my cup of tea my impression was that this would be yet another bloated studio tentpole with cheesy dialog a generic story and artificial looking cgi however once it opened a passionate film fan i respect a lot started spreading so much obviously genuine enthusiasm for the movie that i eventually got over myself and watched iti think it was the moment when nicole kidman swallowed a goldfish that i started to suspect i might actually enjoy this movie that suspicion however turned out to be wrong because i didnt just enjoy it i ended up adoring it the weirdest thing the film did contain all those elements i had feared  and yet none of that seemed to matter it just works it shouldnt but it somehow does which is why ive since come to the conclusion that director james wan is some sort of genius wizard filmmaker dont let the generic superhero tropes and cheesy dialog fool you into thinking this was a typical mainstream movie though i do suspect those things managed to fool the studio executives into thinking exactly that which is probably how james wan got away with it because in truth this is the least generic most bonkers big budget studio flick ive seen in ages its the film valerian wants to be its crazy its overthetop its beautifully designed with incredible attention to every little detail in every frame it doesnt take itself seriously for a second and yet it fully commits to  and loves  its characters and the world they inhabiti was awed literally awed by the design of the atlantian society and technology the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original  which caught me completely off guard because i didnt expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses when the music score went into full synthesizer mode as aquabro and mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginable i had a stupid grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie and the film didnt let up never loses steam theres no weak third act at least in my opinion the wondrous discoveries and beautiful unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end although it has a very different tone i was actually reminded of watching lotr the return of the king for the first timeits true delivers the typical clichd cheesy superhero tropes in spades but those generic story beats  some of which were probably demanded by the studio  seem to be all surface theyre not what james wan or his characters are really interested in it almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding his biggest accomplishment however  the films greatest strength  is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete unabashed funso to sum up this review against my expectations the superhero film i least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again because i was so in love with its bonkers everythingbutthekitchensink approach to filmmaking naturally i now hope james wan will also direct 2 as im sure if given the chance next time not even the kitchen sink will be safeps for new imdb users in case you dont know whether to trust this review or not because you have no idea what my tastes in film are just click on my username  gogoschka1  and youll see what my favorite movies are,fantasy
finally dc seems to be moving towards the right direction i a big fan of superhero movies not caring whether it marvel or dc the movie is very straightforward and you quickly get excited to know whats to come next after the first act and oh please the songs used are really good plus the visuals are really good there are lots of surprisingly good underwater battle scenes and oh my that battle with black manta kills it the main characters are very well explored the ending could have been done better but it seems that would have made the movies runtime longer its really worth the 2 hours of watching it as the pacing is really good,fantasy
that was actually terrible jason momoa is actually just a frat bro they picked off the street amber heard was definitely not cast for her acting ability and everyone else is just as bad the only redeeming quality is the sfx theyre very good even if they look like the gungan city from episode 1 it was paced awfully written awfully and oh god the music was atrocious im pretty sure i can find the weird string music from the desert scenes on imovie and pitbull what is this 2006 just wow the only good scene in the movie is the trench which speak to wans horror roots but jesus the choices made here are baffling i dont want to be overdramatic but im pretty sure this just ruined the genre for me jesus,fantasy
this review is coming from someone who likes superhero films but ill admit aside from wonder woman and christopher nolans batman trilogy dc films are not my fave anywayi cannot believe this has such a high rating what on earth are people getting from thisthe dialogue was terrible the acting was also terrible it couldnt pick a genre was it a comedy was it a soap opera was it a policital piece on pollution of the seas was it star wars did they really need all that tech was it avatar who can tellit was honestly all over the shop i felt like each scene had a different director who was just going to completely disregard what everyone else has done before thempositives the underwater cgi was magnificent like really beautiful jason mamoa is charming ill give him that the female lead didnt need saving once and didnt spend the entire movie screaming so that was refreshingnegatives literally everything elseat this point wonder woman is carrying the entire dceu on her shoulders in my opinion,fantasy
i checked all these reviews before seeing the movie most beautifully visualized dc movie so far better stuff than what mcu offered us for 9 years i was sooo excited i love all superhero movies mcu and dceu i have been hoping for a good dceu movie for so long and have gone to each one hopeful wonder woman was a step in the right direction in my opinion i saw the reviews for this movie and was so excited to see it and was subsequently let down partially because i didnt read into the feud between the two franchisess fanslook this movie should not be reviewed as highly as it is it has great visual effects and jason momoa is actually pretty good however the rest of the acting and writing is so so so so subpar ive been reading reviews all morning about character development how it is way less cheesy than mcu movies just the right combination of funny and serious every scene feels forced like a formula have at least one funny joke one cool visual effect and one heroic speech about the importance of what we are doing so repetitive the entire movie how is that revolutionary or better than any other films the dceu has produced i blame my disappointment in this movie based on the dc only fans who are just forcing good reviews on this movie based on their hatred of marvel because while i definitely love dc and i like marvel sometimes too i pay 15 at the theatre for a good movie not a brandi hope my review brings down some of the hype it is still a pretty good film and of course i love and think that every fan should see the film but i could have waited until it is cheaper on dvd to watch because it simply isnt worth it please dont let the annoying reviews that praise this film as some above holy savior of the franchise sway you because it is not that jewel of the dc universe they claim it to be and if any of those reviewers read this please when reviewing movies leave your anger at the mcu at home so i can not waste money on a film that is by no means saving the dc franchise the last thing i wanted was to associate this film with disappointmenttldr this film really needed a poorer review because the amount of praise it is receiving is unrealistic and causing people to get their hopes too high about a mediocre film,fantasy
hard to watch poorly acted and charmless laughable at times and as boring as listening to a conch shell for an overly bloated 2 hours plus this was a grind when it should have been a breeze not in for anymore of expensive tripe like this that keeps getting peddled like art its it even decent entertainment,fantasy
jason mamoa is absolutely scrumptious this was solely my motivation for seeing this film and when i tell you it was terrible my god it felt like my five year old wrote the script it was painful and it was like 25 hours long it was the worst,fantasy
has anyone read the comics does anyone know story does anyone care forthis film is the story of a weird tattooed trash amphibian thug who speaks like a hoodlum and who for some reason gets trained on the beach with his top offit is like the trashy beefcake antihero of 21st century or somethingwhat rubbish,fantasy
there was not a single intelligent line delivered in this entire movie it is was a nonstop spectacle of the absolute dumbest varietythose that are saying this movie is boring are obviously referring to the fact that their brains were left to rot for 2 hours and 23 minutesi cant imagine a movie being more devastating to the industry than this one having it be so successful and so dumb at the same time is a formula for more dumb movies to follow,fantasy
cinematographyvisualsdirectingaction scenesvilliansdevelepmentsatmospherechoreographyi didnt even think another human being could top snyders visuals in dceu well i wasnt wrong about that one i still think his visuals are the best in dceu but this movie had lots of moments too those wide angle and tracking shots were a treat the cinematography was really satisfying so thank you to don burgess and james wan for that underwater cgi scenes were breathtakingly beautiful to look at setpieces makes you forget about the world you live in not on the same level as lotr or indiana jones or star wars but its close and i think thats a pretty tough thing to accomplish dialogues were cringy now and then but unfortunately thats what makes a superhero movie good nowadays and this probably will continue for the next 10 years too bad the days where nolans tdk trilogy gave you goosebumps with just words are gone now its just you have to act weird and say something out of place to create a chemistry between the characters i cant even believe how people buy these kinds of contrived relationships anymore anyways let me say this the movie isnt something like thor 2011 it doesnt make you feel like youre on a movie set it actually has highquality different places that set the movies atmosphere perfectly if you guys worried about if the movie is just a copycat of mcu film you can relax the only similarity between this movie and mcu movies is 9 unfunny and awkward moment the movie actually harbors multiple layers antagonists are actually valued theyre not just background actors or extra performers they actually have moments to shine this isnt something like antman it doesnt have a stereotype clich and generic film elements that created for the lowest common denominator it actually has innovations for its genre this isnt something like black panther it doesnt have ps2 battle scenes the cgi is actually wellcrafted this isnt something like captain america civil war or most of the mcu films out there it doesnt have a dim or bland color grading the movie actually looks lively and vibrant this isnt something like guardians of the galaxy the characters dont act irrational or illogical they actually have good reasons because they have developments this isnt something like antman and the wasp its not just a filler movie it actually has a worthseeing climax this isnt something like wonder woman it doesnt fail or fall flat in the third act it actually fulfills its mission at every level this isnt something like avengers age of ultron or any other mcu movie the tone isnt out of place the movie doesnt have a recurring and predictable theme the camera isnt too shaky or it doesnt change in every second when an action scene comes up the villains dont act out of character when theyre in a situation this isnt another justice league it isnt trying to be something else it actually knows its place but still nothing can save this universe not even something as good as the dark knight but as a standalone this is something worth seeing in the theatersps its not better than what mcu offered us for 9 years,fantasy
we know that the dc cinematic universe that emerged as a result of the partnership between dc comics and warner bros does not go well does not fall into this category the film first appeared in china then the comments about the movie excited me i was looking forward to it it was a movie i really likedthe story of the film is a complete story of origin we see how a character emerged and how he was a hero we see what arthur curry has been going through since his birth i mean you can follow the course of the story very easily and there is no scene you will be surprised from time to time clichs and boring moments can be experienced when you think its a story of beginnings the cliches dont bother you much i think this is a must for superhero filmswhile watching you feel a lot more of wans touch to the film literally makes you feel like a movie because while watching the film you can see the introduction development and the result line in a very comfortable way everything is as it should be the characters perform their duties more than enough in the first 20 minutes you already feel inside the film and your attachment instinct confirms this the origin of is generally preserved there are some minor changes to the film at the same time there are critical changes in the black manta and orm but if you are a comic book reader in general arthur currys story will give you pleasure the film also touches on a beautiful subject people pollute the oceans and nature jason momoa had a successful performance in particular he has reflected the character change very well willem dafoe is an actor that everyone will enjoy watching willem dafoe had to have more scenesthe film has technical errors logic errors clichs but in spite of all this the good aspects are much more james wan really created a separate world for the film the underwater scenes were very good the visuality is tremendous sea creatures underwater conversations used camera angles location preferences costume designs fighting scenes visual effects were very good the music was just as good as the visuals even a separate film for atlantis can be shot 810,fantasy
watched it and have no words to describe the splendid performance of the cast and how beautifully wan visualised and presented thisthis is the true jewel so far in dc universewont add any spoilersas this is something you should witness,fantasy
i want to cry now last year after watching justice league i was depressed my friend didnt say anything but i know she think dc films sucksso i went to see alone yesterday for the first time in my lifeeveryone was applauding after the movie maybe because everyone who go to watch premiere is a dc fan but when i was waiting for a taxi i heard a boy talking to his girlfriend that this marvel movie is wonderful loljames wan is amazing is very imaginative and its nothing like any other superhero movie ive seen before he knows what we want best dceu film yes i think its much better than ssjlbvsmoswwi cant believe that net production cost is160m much lower than jl300m bvs250mmos225m even ss costs175m wb should give james wan more budget to direct 2ps james says he may direct a horrorstyle batman moviepls wb let him do it,fantasy
i finally got a chance to see yesterday this is my first review ever you can thank jason momoa because thats the only reason this movie made so much money it was the best dc movie theyve put out but it wasnt anything special cheesy and boring story line i dont know what it is with dc movies but they just lack something in their movies that just leave you questioning why you wasted over 2 hours every single time like i said every girl on this planet probably saw it because of momoa thats a lot of money right there,fantasy
it was hard to stay awake during this completely one note movie seriously there is no real plot here to speak ofa couple of pretty women in too tight onesies and just a lot of noise and not much real acting was put into this less than impressive feature after about 10 minutes i pretty much figured we had wasted our money even my husband agreed that this was less than he had hoped for and he usually loves all of the super hero movies regardless of who is the hero but of course everyone is welcome to their own opinionsbut for me this was a real snooze,fantasy
hello reader i am commentatus king of filmus commentia heir of the power of the film comment and so on and so forth that was the whole film dialogue in a nutshellevery film needs context and character development the context was explained meticulously in a boredom parade of dreadfully crafted dialogue and powerrangersstyled fighting god awful cgi  comparable to that of green lantern  and a childlike plot will ensure the dc universe stays in the dark at the bottom of the oceanprosamber heard is hot nicole kidman is hot we get itfights sometimes are fun and somewhat violentconsheard and kidman arent pornstars and this is a movie not brazzerssadly they  heard and kidman  are the thingtowatch at the sheer absence of movie material actresses complain about the objectification of women in hollywood join the me too movement and then they end up showing their attributes on the silverscreen for a check the ironyeverything dialogue in this movie is made so a mailbox can understand the verysimpleanddaft plotdafoe is a rich actor in a poor role with poor dialoguedolph lundgren does  technically  a cameo when he should be the main villain they gave him a noble king type of role horrifyingall pirates are black yeah let that sink for a momentboom marks double combothe main villain is laughable i thought he was will arnett yes seriouslythe fight scenes where so powerrangerslike that at one point i thought the atlantian soldiers would climb on top of each other to form a big atlantian soldier ha ha ha its a joke its notthat scene at the bar with the tough cookie guys that ask for a selfie with was daft ridiculously unfunny totally uncalled for and it didnt built any character cues it seems it was written by a korean girl in her senior year of high schoolthis film is more than two hours use your time on something else,fantasy
theres really not much else to say about this movie its clear they just wanted to dazzle the audience with as much cgi as they could muster into as little time as possible meanwhile making none of the terrible jokes landthe story is well there isnt one really it is so all over the place and disconnected that it is not easy to follow at all both amber and mamoa are dull as dishwater which many knew before this movie and sadly this does nothing to remedy that eitherthe movie is a mess the story is a mess  and when you leave a movie thinking that the only enjoyable part was the cgi then there is something wrongclearly this movie was made for the cash grab and wb once more prove what we have all known for a long time they simply cannot create comic book movies leave it to the experts,fantasy
there are moments of awkwardness in the movie but the stroy is engaging and full of intricate details the visuals are stunning too james wan definitely did an amazing job with the right cast i cant think of a better actor to take the role of than jason momoa i will give it an a,fantasy
very disappointed awful effects with awful acting i think a child wrote the script lol,fantasy
i got the chance to watch this movie at special screening and i must say i was blown away never ever had i expected this movie to be this beautiful and visually stunnning amazing performance of all the star cast was icing on the cake jason momoa nicole kidman amber heard wilem dafoe patrick wilson all gave justice to their rolesthis movie is definitely going to give dceu a lifeline and after i really want james wan to direct more dceu movies in future,fantasy
i really love this film everyone talks about the gci inbut what moves me most is its style so called old fashioned fun here ill talk about thisthis review is translated from chinese by google translaterand im the writer of itfirst of all the story of is classic enough that is the oldfashioned set of some people which is the journey of superhero treasure hunt in an interview with james wan inworldscreenmagazine james said that this is a very classic narrative technique the growth of arthur is like the growth of heroes in spielberg cameron and lucas movies when wan was a child he watched the works of these masters grow up and always wanted to make such a movie so this retro style is intentional the facts also prove that the classic story will not be outdated however we can also understand from another angle that wan did not try to try the dark and deep story style but from the direction of being good at commercial blockbusters in short even if you dont have interest in the retro story the level of the plot is definitely qualified in the superhero moviesecond it is the retro feel of the picture on the one hand many dazzling special effects brought us back to avatar and the lord of the rings until the shock of the first star wars and the imaginative and fascinating atmosphere of the underwater world is obviously a tribute to the classic fantasy scifi movies like those of star wars just like classic fantasy operatic movie opens the window of imagination for us on the other hand james indicates that the film is expected to be like special effects movies in japanlike ultraman and godzilla in last century  no wonder the friend who watched the movie with me shouted the clothes looks cheap when he first saw the soldiers of atlantis  i believe that it is not a problem to add more cool special effects to the soldiers but james chose a very traditional approach  allowing the actors to fight in plastic armor and add to the film a little bit of childlike beauty seeing this armor design is a little touched we seem to be able to see james that realize the childhood special movie dreamshiding behind the viewfinder and snickeringandto be honestim little worried about2which is said to have been planned by warner bros because the first episode is too successfulbut i dont believe james will direct it againjust like saw and fastfurioushe did once and did the bestand im also worried about birds of prey because the director is too young looking dcuor dceu movies is funny we must stand some boring films but sometimes dc gives us big surprise,fantasy
this movie was terrible the acting was horrible it honestly looked liked the cast had never acted before the worst actor being kekoa kekumano he plays the teenage and honestly the casting director had to be high to cast him jason momoa was ok however i still think it was a weird choice to cast him most the cast looked oblivious to what was happening and they probably had to be to take this movie the choreography was one of the worst ive ever seen and so were the transitions however was in charge needs to be fired and never casted again the movies plot was dull and predictable they followed every cliche possible and missed out on some possibly iconic scenes the love interest just seemed forced and should have never been there the lines were laughably bad to the point it would have been better if they said nothing at all the background was too busy in almost every scene and reallly took away from the movie the characters themselves have next to no arcs and are confusing in the beginning they tried to give to many qualities to each character the best part of the movie was the visuals the movie itself was stunningly beautiful in all this movie isnt worth the ipad i typed this on dc really needs to step up there game they need to go back and learn from their mistakes and glows look at what worked and what didnt until then i would advise not watching their pathetic excuses for cinema,fantasy
im also confused about there these reviews came from cliche predictable poor acting forced love interest between characters and terrible music momoa is scripted with too many oneliners that fall pretty flat the fighting was extremely repetitive  all these scenes fighting with tridents became tedious pretty quickly and the ring of fire scene had a shark bait ooh ha ha vibe to itblack manta was gone for 34 of the movie and he contributed nothing to the storyline it would have been the exact same without him im embarrassed that i paid money to see this movie,fantasy
some trashy tattooed thug who looks like he is even more gross than the rock trash talks and speaks rudely and crudely all over the place and they want us to believe he is the son of a queen and royaltyno wonder the movie included rap musicanyone who has read an comic book will shake his head in sadness,fantasy
so i just came back from watching this and for once i wanted to see a dc movie and feel like it was worth my time here are my thoughtsok visualsthe undersea world looked like it had some potential it would be interesting to see more about daily atlantian lifes or how the other seemingly very different kingdoms function sadly james wan did not want to elaborate on thatthat pretty much sums up all the good points of this movie now to the bad onesno character development or any attempt to make the hero resonate with the audience which is very weird being an origin movievery poor acting especially momoa my god  and unexisting chemistry between actors which is almost funny at some points regarding the acting is supposed to go from superconfident in the beginning to somewhat scaredsceptical by the middle of the movie by whats at stake movie tells you thats whats happening at least momoa never portrayed that in any way same dude throughout the movie saying his linesmusic selection is portrayed intentionally or unintenionally being somewhat goofywittysmartass and the music background playing in every one of his scenes sounds like you are watching the dark knight only darker but goofy makes sense no ok moving onjokes were between cringy and plain bad some oneliners especially from momoa made me shiver in discomfort to me it felt like james wan saw thor ragnarok and tried the same approach but much much more poorly executedno real story development or even story felt like a videogame where your hero goes from place a to place b fights some dude that noone cares about im looking at you manta gains his xp and then onto the next scene seriously if manta was not part of the movie it would have made literally no difference pretty much like the joker in suicide squad dc was criticized about it then but here we go againagain regarding the story there is literally nothing original here that you havent already seen in every other popcorn movie before if this is not your first movie then you can easily predict the lines the story the plot twists pretty much everythingand since we are at the story why was that submarine bombarding atlantis as far as we are told noone even believed in atlantis aside from some people who were considered weird or conspiracy theorists by the general public so could the government know about atlantis all along and its plan was to send a lone submarine some thousand meters undersea for what purpose or was it an inside job shouldnt we be told or hinted at least i mean that incident again from what we are told initiated the war underseas that would lead to the invasion of the atlantians against the people of the surface either i was half asleep when they explainedimplied this or the movie was laughably lazy with thisi could go on but i mostly wanted to share my rough feelings on this especially after seeing how highly this movie is praised at this point if this was released in the early 00s where the superhero genre was still discovering itself then it would have been fine but at this point its definitely nothonestly if you care only for the visuals go watch it if you expect anything more do not waste your timepersonally i think i am officially done with the dcu,fantasy
what just happenedno story whatsoeverwaste of my money,fantasy
teeeerrrrribleeee this is one of the worst superhero films ive ever seen i dont think they could make it worst even if they wanted to are people rating this 1010 twelve yers old or something seeing a character youve heard before doesnt in a movie doesnt make it good grow up,fantasy
where do i even begin this was the cheesiest superhero movie ive probably ever seen the costumes were ridiculous there was no chemistry between the main couple and acting skills dont even get me started sorry ladies you cant get around bad acting with extra screaming and action scenes plus there were parts of the story that completely copied disneys the little mermaid it was painfully obvious my wife and i went to see this movie on new years eve and left before it was over because we didnt want to ring in the new year watching this lame movie,fantasy
best movie in dc extended universe so fargreat acting performances great visual effects great screenplay and a great scorein a word fantastic,fantasy
better than any dceu film and some of mcu movies i think the dc has step up their game  this is another level never had i expected this movie will this be good after the justice league and batman v superman because those movies are trash  and lets forget about those this is the most ambitious comicbook movie ive ever seen so far finally a movie that dc fanboy deserves this film is just beautiful within the cinematography visuals also the action scenes the action scenes kinda remind me of romanticism painting it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful im not a fan of james wan movies but he did a marvelous job for the cast are outstanding badass performances i dont think any actors can take the role of better than jason momoa the atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has highquality than any dceu film finally we can see the light after those dark days it has clear motivations for both heroes and villains pretty solidbut dceu really need to fix their poor lines the writing isnt the best  some dialogues are still cheesy  awkward nothing new for the plot but it is simply enough  almost the same with any superhero film  save the world family issues etc but it has a great message about polluting the water also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss and i dont see how and why black manta is the best villains his story kinda flat and lacking for me black manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villainafterall this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans also you have to watch it in an imax 3d worth it,fantasy
yo momma meets meets justice dayat elast the chick was super thin,fantasy
this movie was filled with mediocrity if its considered a dc great i will be saving money by not attending any other dc movies in the future,fantasy
i have never seen a movie where ive not had a few seconds of boredom watching it however i love most movies i watch not one second was i bored in ive never seen a better movie in my life its everything ive ever wanted in a movie action adventure comedy incredible visuals great soundtrack emotion i could go on and on this is non spoiler so im not gonna say much you need to watch this in cinemas the day its out this is my opinion on the movie and i hope you dont disagree with me over my opinion after youve watched the movie the story was fantastic and sends a real message to people about polluting the water orm isnt really a bad guy which is great youll understand what i mean by hes not really a bad guy black manta was great with a great reason for his hatred in wow i was absolutely blown away cried so many times i ran out of liquid in my body i will be going watching it again an extra 20 times i dont care i wont be bored watch it now,fantasy
jason momoa has on onscreen charisma that mightve been able to save this movie but the dialog was total garbage and the other actorsactresses just phoned in their performances wan seemed to want some sort of memorable catchphrase for but all of the yippe ki yay lines were just dull and unimaginative add to that a plot that just careens from one useless hazardous situation to another and a mylittlepony excess of luminescent colors and you just have a 2hr headacheto be fair temuera morrison delivers a great performance hey hollywood this guy needs more work and so does dolph lundgren but these guys dont have a whole lot of screen time,fantasy
rating 9410it is one of the best superhero movies on this year in malaysia  good storyline  great acting performance to all the characters for the director james wan you really did it  for all of you go see it you wont regret it worth a watch,fantasy
the visuals story line  moments in the movie  characters explainations is done in a perfect way its an outstanding movie loved it must watch,fantasy
i was really excited to see what i saw was a poorly executed formulaic underdeveloped film that did not deliver seriously the background music was so cheesy and literally did not stop for the entire movie the jokes fell flat the cgi was atrocious the story was painfully predictableevery time i watch a dc movie i tell myself it is the last time i ever watch a dc movie but somehow i keep falling for the marketing and wind up wasting another 2 hours of my lifei know a movie is bad when in the middle of if i stop and contemplate just how many individually bad decisions have led to a movie of this magnitude being such a terrible film i blame the director composer editor screenwriter composer sound mixer the actorseverybodysee it if you must,fantasy
its like the little mermaid meets tron meets power rangers the acting was sub par and the fights were just not believable and poorly executed think cheesy power rangers and if you are half fish and have evolved then why do you need a leotard with scales and an underwater car bc apparently cant swim underwater underwater laser guns and an octopus playing drums i was done after that oh and the center of the earth with an island inhabited by dinosaurs this could have been a really great movie if they focused on developing the characters instead of throwing everything including the kitchen sink at it the movie was about 30 mins too long it was really uncomfortable to watch and sit through and i was ready to leave the theaters 30 min into it which is only something i have done once before i dont know why other people gave it a 10 ugh its garbage spend your money elsewhere unless you like cheesy power rangers kind of fights and undeveloped characters,fantasy
cgi  10plot  1character development  1this is eye candy not a movie to be respected likely a box office success because of all the hype disappointing ,fantasy
somebody thought the vfx was better than avatarreallyyy not for mevery overratedveryy very overrated didnt do justice to the comics of,fantasy
this film is just beautiful and cast are just amazing orm and black manta are the best villains dcu ever had until now of course cgi and fight scenes are spectacular and story is greatjust enjoy it ,fantasy
my friend makes me go to every super hero movie most range from mediocre spiderman movies to great black panther this one just sucks plot that is too horrible to describe incredibly cliched in every way and the dialogue oh please jason momoa is passable and mostly if the other actors try their best not to smirk as they deliver their lines the special effects are good despite being totally unbelievable but its a eminently forgettable movie that never needed to get made,fantasy
i was proper looking forward to this fish man hybrid film but wow just wow how did they get this so wrong  i would rather watch a tin of paint drying underwater than this again  i am trying to think of something positive  ummm the water looked nice  there thats it,fantasy
 is as interesting as listening to a dial tone i cant believe i wasted my money to see this in the cinemaby way of background i have no particular like or dislike for superhero movies or preference of production housethe plot is thin and completely predictable in spite of terrible script the actors did well but thats about itcgi was completely overblown and in places seemed to be there for its own sakealso what is it with the no 3d in cinemas we attended a vmax big screen cinema and there was no 3d even though the trailers said it was has someone found a new way to screw australian cinema goersanyway a completely flaccid load of garbage wish i could get my 2 hours back,fantasy
this movie has all the cliches you can imagine in a superhero movie it rely on cgi to be watchable forced love story with no real chemistry between the characters,fantasy
you saw the best part of this moviethe script was poorthe plot was predictablethe acting was terriblethe villains werent very villainousthe jokes fell flatlittle character development outside of arthur even though the movie was at least 30 minutes too longway too much bad cgithis movie seemed like a cheesy 60s scifi flick or a kids saturday morning tv showi should have been satisfied just seeing the trailers because i would have saved time money and a lot of boredom,fantasy
movie is long and wack the actors are trash storyline is eh,fantasy
despite not being a fan of the franchise the trailers looked good and reviews were decent so we wentwithin the first 20 minutes we were giggling at how stupid it was the outline of the story was fine just the lame jokes and cringey terminology seriously could they not think of anything better than ocean master the music was all wrong it felt like it wanted to be thor ragnorak so badlyto say that these comics are the darker versions it was silly two brothers fighting and the mom telling them to stop it lacked any decent bad guy i was waiting for willem dafoes character to turn out to be the real villain instead he was strange mr miyagi type character not good,fantasy
i honestly cant believe there are so many good reviews for this movie this was by far one of the most boring movies i have ever seen anyone who has a brain will feel offended watching this,fantasy
i just dont get that i was looking forward for a good movie with a great cast but dc managed to disappoint me again batman vs supermanthe settings tried to appear in beautiful colors but the camera movement was too fast to enjoy itthe costumes appeared cheap and just embarrassing especially the bad guyand i had the feeling that the movie tried to show as many different stuff as possible sahara sicilia atlantis and dinosaursthe dialogues were boring and very predictable as much as the whole movieall in all it was a disappointment,fantasy
this ec comic franchise film is an actual attempt to make star wars in story in terms of fictional world view in the past noone called franchise as universe like the dc extended universe ec comic marketing is like a flood in the film which attacked the father thomas and arthurthe products and icons broadly infiltrated every corner of the world in consumer activities this kind of domination is its powerful commercial profit base globallyand now it started to consume star warslike visual spectacle tradition with crummy cgi and digitally animated aquarium show dir james wan could be equal with stephen spielberg or george lucas its still doubtfulas other ec comic franchise films it is quite ridiculous and meaningless it is a doll play which enjoyed by children at home or park versus bunch of evil amphibious monsters from the trench gladiatorlike battle between the protagonist arthur and his younger halfbrother an antagonist orm who is a king of atlantis and intends to declare a war with the surface worldin short its core conflict is not about the african villain david kane but it is about succession of throne of the entire ocean of the kingdom between arthur jason momoa and ormin fact the david kane episode  subplot can be completely omitted his revenge is just for setting the sequel of this franchise a story fabrication device in terms of script manufacturinghowever it added a light racial conflict between arthur a half breeding guy and african origin this is one of ideologically important aspects of this filmracial diversity is respected in the white supremacy tradition the major ethnic group of immigration country is halfbreeding people is their herocon is obvious that finding the lost motherwife episode among arthur thomas and orm is pretty odd due to the close age between jason momoa and nicole kidman visually it does not like son and mother relationship moreover crummy cgis and digital aquarium sequences weakened the plot clearness to the certain extent and made it boringthe most important feature of this blockbuster is that it reflects the weakening rule of law in democracy instead the rising of rule of kingman in the contemporary neo liberal world order audiences are willing to pay for enjoying the digital aquarium for 143min and excitingly accepting the ideology embodied by this film at the same time it is contradicted in its nature entertainment and ideological control are done by mainstream consumer culture in this way,fantasy
first in for most i really didnt want to see this movie but friends invited me along and i thought why not everyone is raving about it it opens up with a decent story about altlanta who is discovered by a lighthouse keeper and they have a hybrid kid story goes from there to when hes older and eh it begins to fall from the moment he is adult fighting the pirates in the submarine its just a clich of every superhero film youve seen before black manta trying to get revenge on to avenge his father princess of atlantis helps overthrow the kingthe two fall in love for having a journey together challenges king for throne and loseswins later mother turns out to be aliveeven thought she was supposed to be dead and so many many overused lines like ive waited for this moment and they dont need a king they need something greater a hero sorry dc but the writing needs huge improvement its no wonder marvel has the upper hand wonder woman still remains the only incredible dc film,fantasy
bad lacked a sophisticated plot that i expected from a film of such a genre the characters were predictable were left without development and the acting was incredibly wooden it included an unsurprising and unnecessary romantic moment which felt fake and ruined what was essentially the best scene of the movie overall the film was littered with incongruities  the only redeeming factor was the special effects which looked realistic,fantasy
i hated while i was watching it and it has continued to plague me in the days sincethe acting the music the direction were not only boring but uninspired and insulting to me and my family as viewers i feel dumber for having watched that film and pray that i never experience a piece of trash that astonishing againat least patrick wilson was great,fantasy
this movie is by far the best superhero movie of the year  honestly one of the greatest superhero movies of all time you can feel the emotion of all the characters and the villains in this movie are so passionate that you really are rooting for them just as much as the hero himself dc did a amazing job with this movie and showed that theres more great movies to come stay for ending too,fantasy
its like im watching power rangers worlds worst movie ever worse than the emoji move,fantasy
this movie is pretty entertaining that however doesnt mean that it has a great script the truth is dc played safe on this one and it pays off mostlyi was never bored throughout this movie but that is not because of the clever dialogue or the the amazing score no its because everything in it is incredibly overthetop no kidding be it the heroes or the villains the action scenes or the romantic ones every single thing in this movie is kind of exaggerated sometimes it worked for me but sometimes it didnt with that in mind lets get to my pros and consfirst what i liked the most the direction specially during the action scenes james wan managed to differentiate himself from that snyder style of action pretty well theres still one or two snyder slowmo kind of shots but thats it the fight sequences were well choreographed and shot with wide angles for most of the time it was very pleasant to see now i usually dont like when movies start looking like videogames but it didnt really bother me here during the gigantic cgi battlescenes youve seen in the trailers the amount of elements onscreen can be overwhelming but for the most part they are well enough shot that you can differentiate whats going on and so they eventually become quite satisfyingthe interaction between the two lead characters is too very entertaining but then again because is just really extravagant most of the time so it becomes this quirky awkward chemestry but that leads me into the consyeah remember when i said everything was exaggerated in here well sometimes that leads to some really weird and unfitting or just unintentionally funny scenes for example and i dont wanna spoil here the movie will have this really awkward romantic song playing throughout this lovey dovey scene but that just took me out of the film because its so overthetop and doesnt fit at all with the previously established tone of the film it was weird not only that but this certain character will constantly scream during battle scenes like hes a football commentator announcing a goal like hes really badass when in reality it just comes off as just too much i wont lie i started laughing after a while because he repeats it quite a few times during the movie most of these are nitpicks but because this movie blows everything out of proportion these small problems end up really standing outsome bigger complaints are characters having really flimsy convictions and changing them in the matter of seconds for weak motivations the movie is also filled with cliches but thats mostly because follows the standard superhero movie formula on top of that i found some inconsistencies regarding characters abilities like it is established that inhabitants of atlantis cannot breath outside of the water but during certain moments they do it just finethe cgi is very inconsistent from this gorgeous color filled underwater kingdom to some pretty terrible green screen effectsthe dialogue is mostly not very well written some characters dont suffer from it including because it ends up fitting their personality but some characters end up sounding really artificialthe acting is fine willem dafoe is willem dafoe jason momoa is jason momoa temuera morrison amber heard nicole kidman and dolph lundgren all did fine with their respective characters i think the worst ones are the villains played by yahya abdulmateen and specially patrick wilson whos character is the embodiment of overthetop too bad i dont consider him a bad actor but goddamn was he subpar in this onei dont have major complaints wit the editing its pretty good except once or twice where theres just too much going on onscreen and i couldnt follow it but those were rare moments however the sound design has some odd choices theres this scene where a certain character is handling a knife and every time he gently touched it the knife went katching with that standard blade sound  but just extremely loudly and exaggerated i just thought to myself whatdespite the fact that i nitpicked a lot i think this movie works more than it doesnt yes its as a standard superhero movie as you can get but its a good one even with all of the odd choices and apparent problems its not a bad movie the direction is quite good some shots are fantastic and the fight sequences were very satisfying its pure blown out of proportion massive cgi fest fun and i think thats enough for me for an movie it does everything it should,fantasy
the good first it is visually spectacular very nice cgi reminds me of avatarnow the bad boring and predictable story literally no twist or something to keep up your expectations no real connection among the major characters it had oneliner fun at some points but thats all about it battles at some points were confusing with the camera quick shaky movementoverall i get the impression they spent all the budget for the cgi no effort at the script at all its sort of bad overall as a story  perhaps the fault is the way they presented it,fantasy
spent a fortune to watch a 3d imax  but feel dizzy from the 3d quality and the horrible story line too many questionable relationships,fantasy
 orm and manta are comic accurate the movie got some great visuals but the story is predicatble since the second huge trailer i mean there was not a moment were i was surprised by anything including the credit scenethe action scenses are decent slow motion is everywhere the humor isreally the movie is better than most of the others dc movies but still got a lot problems including story connections logic and physics i mean for me man of steel is probably the best one wonder woman was boring this was too maybe one idea better but still predicatable i just dont want to talk about the rest,fantasy
when series are getting some budget and do a great job entertaining methose aaa movies are storyless and make me feel that i loose my money again watching such a flop,fantasy
i dont get why this film is so popular it reminded me of a bad 80s fantasy film with okay special effects a shame because was the coolest character in the justice league which brings me to my next point why the hell doesnt the rest of justice league turn up when theres massive sea monsters coming out of the ocean where is superman when war ships are washing up on the coast this film is a cliched plot holed mess with some terrible performances avoid,fantasy
the movie is so damn cool and is filled with nail biting momemts didnt expect this from the dc universe the trailer was promising taking the trailer as a consideration of dc movies the trailers have done very well to hype up the movie but the result of the movie isnt that good but changed it its an amazing movie it did live up the expectations of fans the way they adore arthur  meras relationship in comicssome scenes were quite memorable  wont say them as its a nonspoiler review is a very interesting character hes capable to do many stuffs youll know when you watch the movie hes badass  funny a good mixture of a superhero personality is a must watch movie ,fantasy
i really gave dc another chance after wonder woman which i thought was a wonderful movie but they have disappointed me again withminor spoilers aheadthe story is extremely messy there are a lot of things happening but the movie never seems to focus on anything which is strange since they had more than enough time to do so the movies running time is rather long and considering the story should have been a lot shorterthe action scenes were boring and seemed to be going on forever up until the last 10 minutes was just a guy who could punch really hard and who occasionally used a trident to do nothing more than use it as a sword it isnt until the last scene that he gains his extraodinary powers of being able to control the ocean and its inhabitants therefore all the action before that moment was a snoozefest and also took forever you just want them to go on with the storygranted both and his love interest mera are very easy on the eye which makes it at least in my opinion more entertaining to watch but on that alone you cant build an entire moviethe visuals of atlantis werent as beautiful as i expected them to be i was kind of confused as to what it even really was it just seemed like a big ruin and a lava pit with a couple of high tech water ships floating above it the sea did have some pretty lights in it though but what the meaning of them was is still unclear to methey also tried to create a villain who had absolutely nothing to do with atlantis but merely had a personal vendetta with the story doesnt pay any attention to him until he comes in handy for some action scenes though why the audience should even consider him a threat is still completely lost on me but maybe im missing somethingoverall i did not enjoy this movie very much but to be honest i still have hope for the character yes this movie wasnt all that great but they didnt ruin his story therefore i think that if they would make a sequel it could still be a good movie as long as they do things differently than they did in the first i would consider to go see a sequel so i guess the movie sort of did what it needed to do610 imme van gorp,fantasy
love this one just like wonder women this movie will lift up justice league to the next level cant wait to see that day come,fantasy
special effects were ok but i really cant see anything else to rave about as others have already said it was predictable,fantasy
how did they get this so wrong looks awful and dialogue is so weekshame to be honest,fantasy
stupid and infantile poor acting and an even worse script full of every poor movie cliche in the book including a car chase done underwater in fish subs the bad guys are boring and predictable and the only 1 demential a younger brother with mommy issueseven my kids were more entertained pointing out plot holes that cheering for the good guyshoulda played monopoly instead,fantasy
if it wasnt for the graphics this movie would get fewer stars i the main actors but none of them fit the part acting was downright terrible so disappointed ,fantasy
they kept calling his 5 pronged spear a trident  the action scenes are like an action packed shampoo commercial you know how they be flinging their hair about add in stuff blowing up and jason momoa flying threw the air from the explosion that happens 5000 times then i died laughing when they recreated several scenes from fast and furious movies when i learned james wan is the director of this piece of crap it works in those movies because thats what they are superhero movie no the acting is atrocious its so bad that dolphlundgren comes off as a oscar winner when hes on screen this is a movie i cant wait to roast in the future i may host a drinking game party to where everytime something blows up and goes flying you have to drink nobody is surviving that night,fantasy
and so convoluted everytime you get a little bit interested something blows up too many factions out to get arthur curry aka i also couldnt quite aligne it with justice league at all a before movie an after storyline both way too complicated just too messy and the end is just plain ludicrous,fantasy
silly and an hour too long what else can i say boring,fantasy
the issues with this film are numerous1 every time jason momoa delivered a line i had to resist the urge to swallow my own tongue his portrayal of was irreverent and immature which i suppose was meant to provide levity but only made his character a laughable choice for king2 the film was too artificial while i understand a movie set in an underwater kingdom requires the use of cgi there was still too much of it where it wasnt needed and where cgi was needed it was egregious and offputting all the scenes set in atlantis felt like tron under water3 the plot was convoluted and contrived this movie offered nothing interesting about the super hero trope and there were far too many moving cogs that only added clutter rather than depthtldr not worth paying for wait until you can watch it on a long flight itll put you right out,fantasy
excellent movie im happy too see a decent effort from dc finally,fantasy
we live in an era in which foto real effects are not that hard to achieve many movies with smaller budgets look more real than this why dont they care or worry about that stuff anymorethis problem is not specific to but to all dceu movies to me it just was more apparent hereif you want to show a lighthouse go outside and film an actual lighthouse they do exist you knowif movies dont even try to make the effects seem real where is the difference to a video game which you cant playi know that this review doesnt contain any info about story acting and other components of i guess youve read it all beforesee this movie if you like vfx that shout im here dont i look cool and if you watch everything superherorelated you might have a good time,fantasy
after two hours of cgi overdose this was my first thoughtmr madison what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul,fantasy
this is a good popcorn movie but i watched it at home on bluray from my public library it has a lot of very deep bass in many scenes and often rattled the glass doors covering the fireplacethe star is jason momoa as arthur the product of a union between a lighthouse operator and a mysterious injured woman from the sea he is destined to become momoa has the looks and at 64 has the stature to be legitimate in that rolehis nemesis becomes patrick wilson as the underwater king orm the halfbrother of arthur their mother is nicole kidman as atlanna each very effective in their roles the general thrust of the story is orm is unhappy with how humanity has been treating the world both above and below the waves and wants to conquer all to make things right arthur being of both ancestries seeks to instead promote cooperation so naturally a mighty battle settles that issuethe computer graphics and special effects are really great but for my tastes there is just too much frantic battles and destruction in the scenes leading up to the conclusion i most enjoyed the first 13rd of the movie plus the last couple of scenes,fantasy
this movie is like if a group of crazy teens wrote the script with too much happening at the same time almost all the time its impossible to get the message we need to identify with the characters love them laugh with them admire them and feel that they are real even if its fiction this movie is artificial and tech crazy but has no heart,fantasy
look i have refused to watch anything dc after what god awful direction they went ins after releasing the masterpiece dark knight trilogy but after i gave suicide squad a chance because it peaked my interest which was okay i decided to give a shot simply for the fact i wanted to see what an action movie shot underwater was likethe movie is full of ridiculous scenes cheesy writing terrible acting  stupid oneliners honestly  the movie reminded me why marvel is where it is and why dc is the kmart version of superheroes with every yesman at dc studios that gives the thumbs up on movies like this just to rake in box office dollars is the reason why dc is slowly losing its legendary comic respect the sfx is okay the movie is colourful its entertaining if you can look past its stupidity and put your brain on autopilot,fantasy
the story is massively painful to watch so many flaws its hard to watch and it makes no fun at allthe action scenes make no sense as well but are at lest well madeif you can watch it on a streaming service go for it but dont spend a dime on it,fantasy
how anyone can rate this film as excellent is beyond meevwry fight scene opens with the same suprise style explosionthe music score is horrendous and made felt like a 90s action moviethe costume design made it feel like a reallt over budget power rangers episodethe cast overall id say was well chosen but no matter how good they were they couldnt save the souless and predictable script from leaving us cringing every few minutesdc have such a wealth of characters and stoeylines to choose from but with the exception of wonderwoman have really dropped the ball in a lot of areasdont waste your money buying this film just wait for it to come out on freeviewsuch a shame as this film could have been awesome given the 160m budget,fantasy
it was ok and here is the problem with dc atmshazam excluded everything dc does is just ok i am dc over marvel when it comes to the comics or animation but marvel nailed it for the movies they do silly little things like deaging someone and making it look believable that was enough to spoil the film for me i could not immerse myself into the film because of that,fantasy
 has moments of breathtaking visuals the work done to make this film is impressive unfortunately i rarely cared about the characters and plot no doubt acting with visual effects not visible on the set is a huge challenge and delivering a credible reading of badlywritten dialogue would also challenge many actors unfortunately the cast does not overcome those challenges,fantasy
this is as bad as it gets not 100 sure whats wrong with dc movies but they seem to miss the mark from a timing and pacing point of view the cinematography is alway great but theres something about the way they piece these together in post that is slightly off even the way they record the dialogue that takes away from the weight of any performance  or maybe it is simply that they dont cast wellwonder woman was a huge improvement for dc and i had high hopes that this would learn from those lessons but imho were back to weak story characters i dont ever get asked to care about terrible pacing disjointed and jumpy transition between acts and a terrible scriptcasting wise if i was jason momoas wife id be overjoyed that there was zero chemistry between the incredibly boring but pretty to look at jason and equally lacklustre and boring amber  the best casting here is definitely dolph and willemmuch like jason and amber this movie is very pretty to look at but ultimately boring and a waste of timeso many bad lines so many holes in the plot so much content crammed in that they forgot to mention some of it so many pointless bit of action and at leat 20 mins too longskip it,fantasy
so now that the movie is finally out on the internet well start to see some real reviews that arent written by the staffthe casting of the actors are absolutely horrible its a pod of second rate blist celebrities that are phoning in their performances in front of a green screen there has to be bigger fish in the sea than the mess they managed to bait for this deep water gravethe music is absolutely horrendous i think somebody got the wrong fish on the hook they hired rupert gregsonwilliams brother of the respected composer harry gregsonwilliams and its apparent the music switches between jarre inspired synthesizer and stupid little guitar motifs that feels more at home in a 1990s zimmer soundtrackthere is no originality in this wreck whatsoever and all you get are the leftover chum and clichs from other composers and movies its insultingly amateurishthe whole movie follows that pattern and im not surprised this movie has 5 writers 1 director and over 10 producers it lacks a strong captainat no point does it feel like a coherent story its more like 34 different scripts was shoot 34 times by 34 different people and then they pasted together the best parts when ever the story tries to float it sinks like an anchorthis movie is an absolute assault on taste and intelligence its mindbogglingly badit is so bad that the only way i could even motivate myself to write a review for it was to google fishing terms and try to insert them into the text for my own amusement,fantasy
as in a movie by sergio leonethe good 1 excellent special effects 2 the actors nicole kidman temuera morrison and willem dafoethe bad 1 globally average and predictable scenario which does not hold water ha ha ha 2 a few jokes barely funny even less than mine 3 dialog not very gentle far away from the batman trilogy 4 in a general way jason momoa with a brain within charismatic bicepsthe ugly in the middle of the film we may see on a boat with mera on a boat on a boat and why not superman on a push scooter what a pathetic nonsensesynthetically a middling pop corn movie,fantasy
 is the most ambitious dc movie and james wan made a really unique sperhero origin movie and the cast are just amazing,fantasy
 is quite classy and smarthere he is a thuggish beefcake that talks trash and spends his time topless on the beachno wonder humanity is in decline industrial pollutants,fantasy
you may think that is the well known story of thronerivalrythen you are right bcos it isbut it is also how wan has executed this story in a appealing manner and has elevated the storytelling of superhero movies it has a racy screen play and great character development  since we saw only a little of the characters in jljason and heard are perfect in their roles and kidman has done justice to her role not forgetting u dafoe  u are gr8 as wellthe music is blended well with the sequencessome scenes get cheesy but overall it is a great load of funi would request you to watch it in an imax 3d to get the most out of it,fantasy
one of the most satisfying movie i watched after a long time from story cinematography to character and world building james wan did a marvelous job this movie is more like a avatar level movie no one should miss this,fantasy
wooden acting dreadful script ridiculously naff cgi one of the most painful cinema experiences of my life,fantasy
walking out of the theater and i am not sure what just happened it was a 25 hour mixture of avatar indiana jones national treasure starship troopers jaws 3d and hemani cant help but think that the writers  producers ate bags of mushrooms when they were concocting the story and editing the scenes it was like a fantasy bedtime story cartoon that lasted two and a half hoursthe glacier sized crab jason momoa rode into battle was so big it could have stepped on godzilla i am not knocking this as badly as it probably sounds but this film really made me feel like i was on drugs  or should have been to fully appreciate the story being toldthe costumes the characters wore  patrick wilsons metal mask frowned when he got mad im not joking  were absolutely ridiculous nicole kidmans dinosaur shoulder pads were something out of the road warriors closet from 1989 summer slami could keep going but you wouldnt believe me until you see it yourself enjoy,fantasy
it looked nice it sounded good the special effects were impressive my family enjoyed it and so did i i have read with interest reviews from those who thought the movie tedious they must have visited a different theatre as the film i saw was far from dull almost too much going on at any one point the lead actor was very good supported by an able attractive cast its not a classic but its better then most of the rubbish being churned out,fantasy
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i thought i was watching a parody of every single super hero ever made or a lame renactment of power rangers i cannot comprehend why anyone would find anything likeable about this movie on the plus side we have never laughed that hard at a movie i actually had to get up and leave at one point because i was laughing so hard the acting was pathetic the script was ridiculously pathetic i think this is the first time ive seen amber heard in a movie i hope its the last time so so bad the best part was the first ten minutes and the last minute everything in between those moments was absolutely garbage,fantasy
appalling script patchy continuity the scarlett johansson look alike was a huge mistake on a couple of occasions i lost the story line and during the war scene i was completely at a loss to understand who was fighting who the sexual tension between the heroes was juvenile and embarrassing far too cliched and the relentless platitudes felt like we the viewers were being treated as idiots love saved the world spare me the drosswilson dafoe kidman werent enough to save this train wreck the only likeable character was temuera morrison i was surprised to see dolph not a fan doing a reasonable jobi guess when a movie is this bad there has to be a concerted effort to talk it up that would explain the ratings and many of the comments which leave me scratching my head in utter disbelief,fantasy
i felt cheated paying full price to see this in the theaterthe dialog was inanethe story was predictable and formulaicthe actions of the characters made little sensemassive plot holes and is inconsistent with events of the other dc moviesmuch of the acting was stilted or phoned in then again with the poor dialog they were given perhaps they were doing the best they couldthe action sequences were boringterrible cgithere was no chemistry between the two main characterslove interestsand i was bored i started looking at my watch less than half way throughthis was a clearly movie conceived written and directed by a committee it had no direction no soul no purpose i honestly rank this at the bottom of dcs recent crop of movies i would watch batman v superman again before i would watch thisthe best scenes were between his parents i would have been happy to have just watched a two hour movie with temuera morrison and nicole kidmans relationshipmy kids loved it but i cannot see how anyone over the age of 25 could rate this a good movie i am confused how this gets such high scores,fantasy
just like every other superhero movie youve seen one youve seen them all,fantasy
 feels more like a video game than a movie atlantean soldiers look straight out of halo although the visuals are spectacular they feel extremely out of place oozing magma laser guns and even flare torches are all seen inside the oceanthe storytelling is completely one dimensional black manta is a weak villain whom the audience couldnt care less about orm lacks any depth like most of the characters in the movieexcept jason momoa and william dafoe even the acting falls flat the dialogue is clichd and if youve seen more than three superhero movies than youll easily be able to complete the sentence after any dramatic pause in the movie even messes up the dceu timeline although the movie takes place after jl arthur obtains his suit and trident in this moviedespite its flaws is clearly a fun movie the dialogue though corny at times does its job of making the audience laugh the stunning atlantis visuals and a decent origin for the character make the movie worth a watch,fantasy
i wasnt expecting citizen kane but people got paid to write a script for this and because i cant boo them loudly in person i shall use this public forumbooooooget another job you talentless hackscasting was alright and whilst heard cant act thats not really why shes hereeverything else about this movie hurt my brain made me dumber and presumably will be judged by a higher power ryan reynolds,fantasy
i dont know if the terrible quality of this movie was intentional lmao if their intention was to make me sigh uncontrollably they sure succeeded bye scrubs,fantasy
it is totally worth itthe acting direction hero villain the whole cast gives the dceu fans what they longed for throughout this timea must watch movie,fantasy
 is a terrible movie it has a bad script dumb costumes stupid villains and an unlikeable hero,fantasy
i dont know how much people got paid to rate this 1010 but it is not very good cheesy bad acting poorly written dialogue cringe inducing one liners oh and the sharks roarunderwater like lions its awful,fantasy
all action with little character development and so much cgi the movie looks animated the jokes mostly miss and feel forced with dc trying too hard to imitate marvel at this point there are still some fun moments but the movie is way too long,fantasy
yes i truly mean it is not just the best dceu film but also the best origin story or solo film in both the marvel and dceu universei last thoroughly enjoyed myself in a dceu film when i watched wonder womans no mans land scene but in this film one cant seem to pick any specific action sequence that is so brilliantly crafted that it stands out infact each action sequence is as brilliant as the previous one the camera movements and lighting effects especially for under water scenes were stupifying ie cinematography on the whole was breathtakingthe third act of this dceu film was a jaw dropping climax the last time i experienced utter silence was during the third act of avengers infinity war this time the theatre was filled with mindnumbing silence creeping upon every unsuspecting viewer slowly but surely making them move to the edge of their seats due to the burdening weights of anticipation nervousness and excitement the film ended with astonishment on peoples faces and a huge round of applausethe visual effects were a treat for the eye mesmerizing and charismatic being an aspiring animator myself i could notice and appreciate the efforts taken in animating the atlantians making them float swim as if they are fishes and not humans and make it all feel realistic from the mosaic underwater architectures the finely detailed character costumes the enchanting visuals to captivating and horrifying monsters and unforgettable marvelous action sequences this film offers everything we need and moresurely it does have the feels of thor ragnarok star wars avatar and game of thrones  all packaged in one one may think that the story is predictable but then get ready for james wann is about to turn your ship sailing event into a voyage far exceeding beyond your expectationspersonally i believe james wann for the dceu is propitious and i wish he directs man of steel 2 or even more dc films is tenacious invigorating and a must see film for not only all dc fans but for anyone looking for a good movie for the weekends watch it in imax 3d on the biggest screen possible and feel the imersive experience of an underwater adventure in the end it will be worth it,fantasy
visualsgood enough and thats itstupid plot insulting story flat characters boring 25 hours,fantasy
good directinggood plotgood settinggood visualsjust amazing,fantasy
when you adapt comic book to the big screen mostly you just adapt it there are exceptions obviously but comic book doesnt translate from page to screen or so we were toldand then along came james wan what a director what a movie this is one of the most accurate comic book movies like everexcept the lead who looks nothing like from the comicsso jason momoa is great in this role no doubt about it and just like gal gadots wonder woman zack snyder cast peoplenot very good in terms of acting abilities who naturally fit to these characters i mean from the first shot of him onscreen youre like he look nothing like ive read but he isback to comics accuracy every other character is authentic esthetically and personalitywise black manta really is black mantathey even explain why his helmet is so damn big oceanmaster has his iconic helmet and etcnow the action james wan gives the fight scenes in a unique cinematic language they always begin with wide circular shots that help establish the geography and after were used to surroundings james starts cutting to the choreography and also long take fight scenes quite few of them actuallyfilm is pretty fast paced but still manages to deliver solid story arcs and clear motivations for both our heroes and our villains performances are solid overrall no clear standouts at least to mei dont even need to say that the movie is visually stunning you already knew that from the trailersthe score pretty good theme is repeated quite often and after the credits roll it kinda sticks to your brain on a loop character themes overall are very good although oceanmaster theme is too dark considering the fact that he is not evil personallyin the end its a feel good movie for the whole family with some real heart and genuine humori highly recommend it9510,fantasy
i am a fan of mcu  dceu who favors dc comics not movies over marvel but lets be real this movie is objectively bad the visuals are pretty neat momoa is likeable and manta with his suit is pretty sweet this however cannot outweigh the atrocious writing poor directing bad directing and poor actingone thing at a time the writing is so lazy there is no explanation of character relationships specifically willem dafoe  momoa the lore is hastly given and the super hero cliches are bad this is all on top of the worst written script i have ever experienced every line of dialogue explained everything that was going on very blatantly thats not how dialogue works additionally there was absolutely zero character developmentbasically everyone outside of momoa and herd should be replaced in this movie the movie was littered with actors who stood out like a sore thumb herd was pretty bad too but i have a little faithin essence the movie is reminiscent of green lantern neat visuals likeable leading actors and a cool promising secondary villain and an overall trainwreck,fantasy
virtually everything about this movie is straightup stupid starting with water how does water work the answer changes scene to scene i realize it doesnt work to shoot this underwater for real but come on nothing about this movie is remotely good or compelling or original i wish i hadnt seen it,fantasy
worst film ive seen in a long while boring poor plot terrible acting i cant believe people are giving this a 1010 i actually left the cinema early as i had no interest in how it ended probably with beating evil and getting the girl  just a guess,fantasy
terrible cheesy and cliche bad dialogue and scenes stretching out forever,fantasy
where could i even startlet it be known immediately im unimpressed with the dc cinematic universe thus far though not bad ive considered the movies very underwhelming for the most part i think they dropped the ball thoroughly and rushed to make justice league 2017 without debuting most of the characters first like marvel didnow is a delicate one because lets be honest hes hard to take seriously he was silly in smallville 2001 he was silly in his own cartoon all the animated outings and the live action television series never even got past the pilot its a dude who talks to fish and once taken away from water doesnt really have a gimmick for this reason and many more i was skeptical of the dcu version and with good reason sure he was fairly neat in justice league but here reallyyou see straight off the bat ill say i like momoa id consider myself a fan hes a competent actor with a unique look but hes not arthur curry is the blonde haired jock looking character not long black haired bearded samoan looking fella so as much as i like the actor i struggle to see him as this character who has been around since 1941 and has always had the same look which theyve not embracedso getting over that what do we have over 2hrs of cgi laden silliness featuring our beloved fishman atlantis tridents oceanic life fighting for him and goofy looking villains in fact its so cgiladen and so colorful it may as well have been animated because it practically is anywaythe story is very hollywood very by the numbers stuff so no surprise there the cast is decent enough but people like dafoe just look so out of place because theyre too good for thisid like to say this is take your brain out fun but its not suicide squad 2016 was take your brain out fun this right here is get yourself a full frontal lobotomy mediocrityits cheesy its tacky its over the top it lacks the laughs that could have saved it to an extent and its done nothing to redeem the dc universe in my eyes especially considering id count this as their worst movie yet is one of those critically acclaimed movies that ill never understand why and can only assume its fans are mostly made up of children and ladies lusting after momoathe goodmomoa is the personification of coola few funny momentssome very impressive visualsthe badthat simply isnt arthur curryhard to take any of it seriouslytacky hollywood nonsense,fantasy
loved everything about the movie story  vfx  acting  background score visually stunning better than marvel in many areas really loved this one from dc this is a lot better than black panther just go and watch it,fantasy
nice cgi remind me of avatarhahagood story  better than justice league,fantasy
this movie is a complete package great actiongood character buildingdecent score and a good old story linejason momoa is tailor fit forthe way he towers over everyone is simply amazing i was a bit sceptical about the underwater sequences after seeing the same in justice league but here they have taken the effects and cinematography to another levelthere a lot of cliches and few forced laughs toobut they dont matter much because the very next scene its something fresh as the editing is super fast pacedthe supporting cast is also pretty decent with good performances from the entire cast this is a much needed boost to dceu and iam looking forward to the sequel,fantasy
expect nothing more than a very comic like tv trope filled movie with lots like 99 of cgi it has bad dialogue predictable story and way too much content after an hour i was about to fall asleep from all the ridiculous cgi and fights if you think it wont get any worse it constantly doeswhat i enjoyed with the movie was most of the land scenes as well as black manta he was a very good villain and shouldve had much more screen time the sound and effects were very good as was the cgioverall a 510 its very mediocre i would not watch this movie twice if i got the option,fantasy
ok i saw this a month ago at a pre screening and it just blow my mind the plot is simply enough but its the way james wan makes you care for the atlanteans and ofcourse ocean master brilliantly but if a little camply played by payrick wilson and more importantly how we the surface dwellers have poisoned the oceans with plastic materials and maybe deserve some form of retribution my concern originally was the acting ability of amber heard and jason momoah but for me wan gets two great performances from his leads especially to my delight jason momoah and the supporting cast are simply stellar black manta is next level dope and the action film choregraphy and fighting scenes are some of the best witnessed on the big screen the music score has epic moments but also can have some strange choices at time but overall the score was great the last act is worth the admission alone and i dare anyway to come out of this movie not being in simple awe at what they witnessed and beautiful the world of atlantis isfor the record im not a dc or mcu fan but i am now a james wan fan cant wait to go see it again on wednesday this time in 3d imaxps stay for the midcredit scene and please please somebody give james wan the keys to the dceu universe,fantasy
i never take my time to write reviews about anything i even made a profile just to write here i just think this movie deserves soooo much more credit the movie lasted 25 hour but i were never bored not even for a second this is legit the best movie i have seen as long as i can remember the crazy water effects are insane full respect for the crew and i recommend everyone to watch this movie atleast once,fantasy
 is the most incredible dc movie of all time a real superhero movie,fantasy
i seriously dont understand how this film is getting such good reviews its one of the worst films i have ever watched at the same level of fantastic four fair enough people are entitled to their own opinions i respect thatgood partsthat fight scene in sicily was decentstruggling to find anything else that was goodsome of the set pieces were good i guessblack manta was okaybad partsthe acting was awful jason mamoa couldnt show any emotion when there was meant to be a sense of urgency or peril he slaughtered that sense with his overall nonchalance throughout the film ocean master awful name for a villain btw has a laughable response when seeing his mother for the first time in decades more comically confused then surprised or shockedthe socalled twist with the mother returning was so predictablethe cgi for the majority of the film is appalling remember the complaints about the inconsistency in the cgi in justice league those complaints remain withblack manta was wastedthe fight scenes this annoying and tedious spinning shot with all the fight scenes the first fight scene is okay the spin shot seems cool but is ruined by awful and simple choreography and those fights couldve ended within a second if the enemies just shot also what kind of a hiding place is a corner the next fight scenes have the same spinning shots and they were so tedious and frustratingthe pacing of the film was horrendous along with character development it felt rushed at the start and felt too obliged to introduce all of the characters straight away you ended up forgetting half of them near the start where black mantas dad i think dies is terribly done you have no sympathy due to a lack of development and appropriate pacing ocean masters character development is awful and he is just terrible throughout the film i mean patrick wilson was amazing in fargo season 2 as lou solverson but what happened here other character developments are lacking such as vulko and merawhat the hell was that africa cover this scene made me laugh cos of how bad it was it cuts to them walking and this awful africa cover starts playing really abruptly and just ends like 5 seconds later it doesnt fade in or fade out im still trying to figure out if this film is supposed to be taken seriouslythe after credits scene wasnt impressive i know marvel initially copied dc with their origins but this film felt like it was tring to hard to be like guardians of the galaxythor ragnarok which are amazing films the who is is dumb given that throughout the whole film is making hinself well known and is being very public about his superhero identity this guy is meant ti be a professional journalist how does he not know who isit dragged i asked my friend how long was left and was saddened from hearing it still had 2 hours left some long films dont feel long or at least are enjoyable throughout their length such as fargo ballad of buster scruggs infinity war and the matrix but this film felt like foreveroverall if youre looking for a film to laugh at for 2 hours this is a good one not because its intentionally funny but because of how bad the film is as a whole and if youre a film student most likely you will despise this film one of the first movies that made me almost go to sleep almost as i wanted to give it a fair chance and didnt want to miss anything that may be redeeming however i wish i had fallen asleepapologies for any grammatical errors you may find this rant is too long to proof read,fantasy
this movie is just a testament to what dc has been doing the acting was subpar the action sequences were constantly interrupted by explosions there was no proper story to follow script seemed like it was written by a bunch of drunk grandfathers there was unnecessary effects and bad sound effects all around the place would not recommend this movie to anyone dc stop trying to compete with marvel and add subtle comedy to your movies its just not your gamei give it a 110 sorry jason,fantasy
the poor dialogue the stilted acting the soundtrack were all dreadful my god im okay with movies being middleoftheroad and just entertaining mission impossible for example decent filmsnot incredible but entertainingthis was awful im not needlessly harsh when i say that there was nothing redeemable about this filmas soon as jason momoa dropped down into the submarine and turned slightly to the side with a douchey smirk and uttered permission to come aboard i knew i was in for a recalling of mortal kombat annihilationlevel badness okay maybe not that bad but closevisuals were all right but the coloration was weirdfor what its worth my 8yearold nephew loved it ,fantasy
i hope the headline is clear enough the only good thing in the movie was the visual effects work i mean its supberb but other than that its just not worth it the acting was not good and the sound track is godzilla like my wife slept through out the movie and rightly so i shouldve known better but the hype that surrounded the movie made me go see it shouldve seen glass instead,fantasy
this is the most stupid film i ever seenits bad in every detaillook at rotten meat is more inspiring then this,fantasy
ive had some issues with dc but i really enjoyed wonderwoman and from the trailer i thought this one could be good too i didnt have high expectations but still i hoped it would be a good moviei was wrongthe visuals are great beautiful colors and i really liked the underwater scenes but it ends thereblack manta seriously why was he in this movie if they had removed him it wouldnt have made a differencethe costumes and wigs amber heard as the ariel of dc in the cheapest red wig i have ever seenthe jokes were so dry and boring there was no chemistry between jason mamoa and amber heard you could anticipate everything that was gonna happen there was so many bad things about this movie their technology is so good that when the city collapse they can breath under water makes no sense what so ever im really disappointed ive tried to watch dc but its not worth it,fantasy
did we see the same movie couldnt have surely this was awful seriously im not exaggeratingnow i love me a bit of cheese but this was curdled milk nothing more nothing less some people obviously like curdled milkthis could have been amazing let me start off by saying the casting of jason momoa was inspired he visually is this is where the compliments end acting all round was shocking patrick wilson as the bad guy come on my cats are more threateningthis film seemed to pay unintentional homage to flash gordon heman the movie tron remake harry potter lord of the rings transformers 3 baywatchyou get the gist oh and please do not get me started on the fluterecorder scene wtaf was that i actually laughed out loud in the cinema and i could hear a chorus of groans around me from otherspoorly cast  poorly executed such a shame as this could have been a belter dc vs marvelthink i will stick with marvel as they never seem to get the dc ones quite right caveat thatwonder woman was surprisingly goodits dreams of becoming a cult classic will be just thata dream,fantasy
so many cringe moments even momoa could not save this moviecan be moderately entertaining only if you completely switch off your brain,fantasy
a predictable cheesy over the top line up of cliches matched with big names and small acting i couldnt enjoy this at all at least it was so bad that it actually became a bit funny at some pointthere are no words for the ridiculousness level this movie has reached total waste of time,fantasy
this movie exists to make moneythe cgi is so over the top that at many points in the movie it looks like youre watching an animation the waves fire and hair movements under water are so unrealistic it was very disappointingthe storyline isnt much better your typical brother vs brother drama with silly costumes and way too many sarcastic quips and one liners getting on the submarine  permission to come aboardwatching the characters swim is also very cringey noting flows well its not organic it looks like puppets being manoeuvred with pulley stringsit just didnt work at all you cant immerse yourself in the movie because its so hyperunrealistic,fantasy
long story short if you lived thor ragnarok you will adore this movie,fantasy
everything about this movie was great it has awesome actors absolutely amazing scenes both on land and in the sea the story line is great and the actionfighting sequences were superb you will love this movie go see it,fantasy
after 10 min i skipped through the rest of the film boring insanely overthetop cgi and bad dialogue was like watching a video game,fantasy
james really did iteasy but terse storiesshocking fightingsfabulous underwater scenes and excellent actings of every charactertime to rise againdc,fantasy
the script is formulaic and the characters flat the villains contrived and unconvincing the politics of atlantis dont make sense the soundtrack is out of awful,fantasy
the best dc movie after the dark knight 2008 in my opinion,fantasy
mindblow just watch it and i love every detail on this movie thank u james wan jason amber etc,fantasy
great film and great addition to the avengers fold it really is a gripping watch from start to finish enjoy,fantasy
oh please such a waste of my precious time is just a boringutterly overrated teen targeted cgi on steroids cliche collectioni rated it 4 for the echological not so hidden message and for the cast of jason momoa he is the perfect but all the remain actors were there only on automatic pilotwhy do you cast dafoe if he isnt meant to do what he does besti saw this with my wife and daughter they rated it 6 only for momos looks unfortunatelly is not my kind but like i said up there he is the perfect cast for this movieenough said not even with chips,fantasy
firstly its nice to have a fun superhero movie not something dark and gritty this is how superman should bei like momoa he deliverstheres parts however that are just poor really bad writing such as the child with a ridiculously coincidental pinnochio book as a gift the clichd story arc of a person who is dead that you know is not really deadi think the constant bombardment of visual entertainment helped hide most of how shallow the movie really was and as such was my favourite dc movie so far,fantasy
i read a lot of comics and this is a very accurate live action depiction of mythos the film features the two antagonists just enough to do them justice and pays it off nicely to end the movie relationships are established that made the film full of heart and respect for the original material a lot of reviewers talk of abrupt scene progression but in my opinion it was an element that added to my interest in the plot in retrospect i think they complain about stories as a whole and that is an unfair scale to grade the movie,fantasy
bland and uninspired i cant believe im using those two words to describe this thing its a cgi clusterflub dumbasbricks film from start to finish type movie uninteresting cliche villains shoehorned attempts at sentimentality and one of the dumbest plot twists in the history of cinema make this a failed attempt by the wb and company to keep a failing universe afloat there really is no saving anything from this universe save wonder woman at this juncture what a terrible terrible movie,fantasy
if i could give less than 0 stars i would nothing but cgi garbage who ever gave this movie 10 stars works for the industry,fantasy
the movie simply focuses on the story though its within the dc universe its definitely one of the best after wonder woman james wan n the team has done a great job,fantasy
i wonder how many millions they have spent on fake reviews for this suckage i doubt even children will be entertained by it pathetic characters  warned out plot boring fight scenes you will forget it the moment its over big shame they wasted so much on this,fantasy
ignore the metacritic notes some kidbrain critics are started their attacks its a dc movie not a marveldisney so thats the reason of this bad ratingsgo and see it best dceu movie and an extraordinary superhero movie you must see it on the big screen if it was a marvel movie than would be 80 points or higher,fantasy
if you like movies this one probably isnt for you it was a marathon to stop myself from falling asleep with a terrible script almost no character development tinny acting from everyone except william dafoe and he wasnt at his best by any means and a complete lack of substance all this makes the dullest film ive seen since the other dc disappointer man of steelif you havent watched this movie yet i recommend you dont waste your time,fantasy
i am going to write this review as a movie goer and not a critic i am not a fan of how critics write their reviews because it doesnt apply to the general audience so as a normal movie goer this is my review was a fun movie with a lot of upside to it the way jason momoa plays arthur curry is perfect he has an attitude that no other superhero really has he is witty sarcastic funny but also has his sensitive side i really enjoyed him as but as for the other actors they were average my one rip on this movie is the cgi dc hasnt really produced a good movie with good cgi yet and this movie better than justice league when it comes to visual still lacks the way a marvel movie would so as a fan i noticed the cgi and acting wasnt very good and the dialogue was pretty poor i also though adding manta was just a waste of time and space in the movie his character was a below average villain who besides his fathers death didnt show a compelling story as a character i did enjoy however how fun the movie was and how upbeat and also caresmatic it was i think as a fan this movie is worth seeing because of it being a super hero movie who we havent seen much of and how fun it is i am giving this movie a 7,fantasy
its starts badly and quickly degrades into one of the worst films of the year dodgy acting awful script and reminded me of the power rangers avoid,fantasy
lotr flashbackepic score epic story and epic screen play,fantasy
from the start this seemed like a joke of a film and not in a tongue in cheek humourous way i mean awful effects bad costumes taken straight from a power rangers tv movie bad jokes amber heard looking like a second rate poison ivy antmans less fortunate cousin and a really boring storylinedc really need to stop making movies now i doubt theyll ever get it right,fantasy
i really dont understand all the positive reviews on here this must be one of the worst movies i have seen in a long timesure the visuals are great but what is a movie without a great story righti thought the plot was utter thin and way to predictable there was almost no character development and all the jokes fell flatthe dialogue consisted of oneliners and overdramatic stuff like not every dialogue needs musicthis movie has also one of the worst subplots i have ever seen and goes nowhere the movie would be the same without it i laughed a few times at the many cheesy moments in this movie and not because it was funny but because it was so badto sum it upcgi fest without depthdo not recommend,fantasy
such an amazing movie i feel like my brain is full of dopamine after watching it so great heading to watch it third time ,fantasy
its the best dcu movie so far cgi is the best acting is is very good the events are logical,fantasy
a combination of the little mermaid and power rangers left the theater after an hour,fantasy
this whole movie is just horrendous first  why did atlanta kill all those robots in the beginning if she was going to go to atlantis anyways second  our main character has natural gifts but besides that he is a drunk going against a trained warrior with the same natural abilities third  why the hell did the villain that fought in sicily look like a villain from the power rangers  that all you could come up with with 160200 million budget  i quit therei was gonna stop watching earlier but i hoped it would get better it never did and the sicily fight was it for me oh and during the underwater fight  what is the point of them throwing each other left and right and scraping each other against the rocks we already know that does 0 damage to them its just horrible the whole movie everything about it this blond king guy is asking some fish people with actual tails to go fight alongside him on earth how the hell are they gonna do that  they have tailswtf is the point in thatugh everything about this movie is so irritating ,fantasy
the movie as a whole was too predictable it lacked a ton in writing the cgi was great and what could be a great movie turned out to be just boringfirst the main character didnt even want any of this he got pushed with the ideals of another person mera who should of literally be the queen at that pointsecondly there was a ton of cryngy moments like when the movie was about to end mera said there was too many casualties in the war moment later kissed arthur while the war is going on in the background probably between 300400 died during that kiss like wtfthird from the moment the movie started i knew not only how its going to end but literally every detail of what will probably happen because the plot lacked twists or something interestingsadly what could of been an amazing movie turned out to be a one dimensional origin story of and in the movie he didnt even deserve to be the hero probably all the reviews that are 1010 or 910 were created by dc to gain more money on a higher rates movie,fantasy
i really wanted to love this movie i really did unfortunately the story is messy the choice of music is awful the computer enhancement is at times overpowering and there is no real chemistry between and mera ugh watching this felt like watching a cheesy chinese action movie and i have never enjoyed those,fantasy
 my constant questionas im still sitting through this movie the plot is boring the characters are cheesyi think dc attempted to have a brighterupbeat movie like marvel but its so predictable cheesy and not funny,fantasy
there was embarrassing writing embarrassing acting and listening to amber heard trying to deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting why does half of the population of atlantis sound like theyre from california the dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot the advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world trope is already old there was so much cgi that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real any time someone said ocean master with a straight face i wanted to laughthis wouldve been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like thor ragnarok but they just try so hard it has none of the superhero charm that marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring sloghow many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didnt hurt anybody i counted three or four also that paintbynumbers forced romance  wow there was a surprise and now were accidentally holding hands wow there was an explosion or something and i grabbed you   give me a break and whoever put together the soundtrack for this film should be summarily executed,fantasy
far best dc movie i have seen plot action graphics a defo must watch in the cinema go and watch it what you waiting for,fantasy
incredibly bad movie script woeful acting even worse the big budget cgi made it look like a computer game rather than a movie  its like a mashup of avatar and power rangersdont waste your time,fantasy
wannabe so many things such a mess boring cgi abomination and waste of time,fantasy
even in the realm of a makebelieve comic book universe things should respect the rules of physics when you watch you are left with the newly emerging and very real condition of cgifatigue nothing you see before you registers as real in your brain because nothing that moves a certain way in water moves that way in this film one exits the long dizzying experience feeling like theyve just watched a long video game nothing is scary anymore nothing is exciting or suspenseful because the filmmakers use no visual restraint in their storytelling the excess of cgi use in films like have just made us stop caringjason momoa mumbles out his words without any charisma or life he comes across like an early and unpolished version of the rock and his lack of acting experience stands out in stark contrast to veterans like nicole kidman and willem dafoewhere fails in engaging the audience in a compelling story through its weak acting and visual diarrhea it does make up for in one area  costume design,fantasy
the film is formulaic and derivative with few redeeming features the plot is weak predictable and dull with no sense of threat and the few moments of awe or surprise are fleeting theres a variety of settings and scenes but they all end in the same way the special effects are mostly subpar and the costumes look cheap and tacky the acting is good but theres no real character development and the forced humour is awful,fantasy
weak trama actors nice aestetically but nothing else too long so that the sacrifice to stay seat in a cinema is too big in essence a loss of money and a waste of time thanks marcello,fantasy
despite the fact that i am a big momoa fan and i loved to see hem play i think this movie doesnt have one original angle it is a non creative mix of elements we already know from other movies like temple of doom da vinci code superman the ironic jokes are funny neither intelligent a missed chance there are some fantastic effects so it is worth the long sit but over all i expected a more intelligent movie,fantasy
what a disappointment this movie was especially in 3d there were hardly any 3deffects to speak of in this movie and it seemed that it was oriented more towards young kids no surprise between the ages of 8 and 13 the continuous litany of explosions and one crisis after the other made it a very uninteresting movie for an adult yes the visuals were stunning with respect to the underwater world but the dialogue was cheesecake lame and watching nicole kidman try to recapture her glory as a 30year old was too much to takedont waste your time on this one at the theatre you can catch it on netflix when it eventually arrives,fantasy
so i came on here to check reviews then proceeded to watch the movie supposed to be a masterpiece but in visuals and storytelling well its pretty much the opposite of that for the acting the cgi the plot and much more i call it the worst movie i have ever watched if you are not a dc absolute fan which you probably arent since you most likely wouldnt be reading this review anyway you will not like this movie,fantasy
bad acting bad cgi cringe script this movie is a totally garbage,fantasy
this was such a letdown was the best part of justice league which is an underrated comic book movie and i expected this to be comparable to wonder woman in terms of quality i was way off the dialogue was so bad momoa the only good lines the writers just quit trying beyond that everyone else was very stale and uninteresting amber heard was terrible i thought patrick wilson was good in other stuff ive seen him in but he was bad in this i cant believe dafoe and kidman took these parts after they read the script this is the worst theyve been in yearsit was really incoherent in terms of style it was game of thrones for a while then it becomes and indiana jones movie for the middle third of it the end is a take on king arthur set in avatar world it was a messill probably always watch dcu movies in hopes they finally get it right but so far wb has completely whiffed on putting out a good product,fantasy
the movie was too long monotonous with corny dialogues the story was boring predictable with nothing special to offer,fantasy
took the kids to see the amazon prime member early release the movie was great and jason momoa has made a cool character the story has substance and the visual effects are great fun for the whole family,fantasy
my expectations were low but the movie managed to disappoint me non the lessthe characters are all shallowly depicted nothing to relate with dialogues dont go beyond clich banters no communication heartfelt message conveyed among the main character s at any pointacting is poor as well mainly influenced by the lamest lines i guessthe story is hammered by continuing meaningless action scenes sustained by b movie music scorewillem defoe is the only exception in the general acting disaster he manages to build a credible if minor character the teen versions of are also much more articulated and credible than the adult grunting hipsterkids cartoon level cgi completes the package of this parody of a superhero movieembarrassing,fantasy
since the release to 36 hours now i have been up in the middle of the night to see the changes in word of mouth and box office dceu can no longer fail otherwise no one dares to shoot i hope that the legend will become true christopher nolan makes justice league2 as a dceu mcu double flour is really what i am   ,fantasy
so many 1010 reviews not even pulp fiction or the godfather got thisi hate that imdb cant control this fake reviewersjust because al that 1010 i think is really bad,fantasy
whats going on all the 10 star ratings its crazyi absolutely hated this piece of trash jason is cool but it ends there amber heard is just a terrible actress and it showed especially when she gets cheesy dialogue nicole kidman is amazing but didnt have a lot to do with the overall feel of the movie the jokes made no one in my theater laugh literally no onecgi is understandable to create the underwater world but there were lots of moments when the characters where replaced with cgi and it looked terrible there was only one moment where we actually saw patrick wilson besides that he looked cgied the whole timethe movie dragged way too long after a good opening start we get no introduction to atlantis but we suddenly need to care for it even the establishing shots of atlantis seem dull because there is no back story or whatever almost to the end we get some backstory but its not enough to make you care about atlantisa big cgi battle where the bad guy fights a not introduced opponent who is also completely cgi how are we supposed to feel any connection to thatdont even get me started on black manta he was pushed aside and suddenly came back during the whole national treasure part of the film he looked so silly in the suit and acted even worse he has a big death beam but after using it starts to actually fight it made no senseit really had potential if they replaced amber heard opened with a better explanation of atlantis kept intro short and then started with the actual story it took more then an hour to really get somewhere in this film and by that time i already knew where it was going and was already bored,fantasy
to be fair i was watched this film in a group and would not have gone by myselfbut what absolute nonsense if it was not written by a child it was certainly meant for a child it is just hours of unadulterated cgi that tires and numbs your mindwhat really amazes me is how this junk is considered entertainment and the mentality behind it,fantasy
imdb really has to find a system to weed out the fake reviews somehow any score above 510 is a child or faketheres no story no real conflict just lots of special effects you might watch a computer game for a hours as well i suspect 90 of what you see in the movie is cgiand what was the conflict again see dwellers vs surface people good one dc mcu sucks when it comes to villains but you even know how to top that,fantasy
cheesy from start to finish i would be upset for paying to see it except it was so bad i actually enjoyed laughing at it,fantasy
cannot believe this movie has been rated so highly it may actually be the worst movie i have ever watched dont waste your time with this one,fantasy
this movie was so bad i dont even know why im giving it a 2 the entire film looked like a video game cutscene a two hour long video game cutscene the story was the most bland unfunny and cliche ive ever seen and god knows what they did to willem dafoe but lets just say there was never a greater waste of cgi than in poor jason momoa he should have taken the role of drax when he was offered itid rather watch justice leagueyes its that bad,fantasy
absolutely the worst film ive sat through in many many years lots of digital effects and zero coherent story line terrible acting avoid,fantasy
its like a marvel movie without any of the things that make the marvel movies great the story feels rushed theyre trying way too hard to make it a cool movie so much so that it feels forced and awkward not recommended,fantasy
walked out so bored dialogue clunky the underwater effect on everyones face was offputting and laser sharks best bits were jason momoa in a bar hes got good comedy acting chops tries his best to make the one liners zing could have watched two hours of that but the eyelines were all wrong and it looked like a poor avatar all jellyfish and sparkles,fantasy
 gives us what dc always has a corny predictable story with goofy out of place characters spewing cheesy one liners as everyone prays to the green screen gods that the visual effects will mask the absurd dialog and shallow acting the gods are somewhat merciful and give us a few eloquent visuals that make us forget if even for a moment that this film is just an exxon valdez away from a full fledged dumpster fire yes its a movie its supposed to be entertaining and entertaining it is there are numerous fighting sequences can you say overkill and a few good laughs at the expense of the characters or actors dignity but there is so much more at stake here dc is drowning beneath the riptide of marvels success and if they want to break the surface and breathe again dc has got to stop spending money on sinking ships,fantasy
in nearly 30 years of going to the movies ive never ever experienced a crowd cheering for a movie to be over like it happened today in berlins biggest cinema this movie should be called how the cringe stole christmasseriously lets leave the non existent plot aside the editing is so awfully off the sound design is just ridiculous in one of the first scenes when the pirates enter the vessel they have a assault rifle firing with a muffled sound but no silencer the lasers attached to the guns were buzzing have you ever heard a laser pointer buzzing this movie is so incredibly lazy the visual style were clearly copied from tron and avatar the soundtrack is literally a mix from a low pitched sad trombone and clone of daft punks award winning tron soundtrack done by someone that really hates music if anything this movie is so linear and predictable the comedy is out of place and edited always half a second too slow is nothing but a very expensive glorified first semester film school project and trust me ive been there,fantasy
how bad is this filmanswer  if you like power rangers from the 90s then you will love thisvery hammy and just like the power rangers program from the 90seven the costumes are terriblebad film,fantasy
i am horribly disappointed with horrid writing and acting almost no story plenty of violence if thats your thing no redeeming quality but maybe for the cgi,fantasy
absolute embarrassment made a mockery of this classic dc superhero,fantasy
simply 1 star for it is impossible to have rating 0 and for the guys and girls who did the special effects,fantasy
terrible terrible movie sooooo boring aqua man cant act and the action sequences seem pointlessly long save your money,fantasy
the battle scenes are epic and the action is fast paced but over all this movie was not better than a 510  i will not go into all the should haves or why did that just happen comments i will say that maybe we are all a little super hero drunk right now and we can not tell what is better or worse,fantasy
by now i think everyone knows dc cant make a decent superhero movie without chris nolan or a woman in charge it is the batman trilogy wonder woman and then we have to travel back in time decades to tim burtons batman films and richard donners supermanwhat is the difference between dc and marvel how come there is such a gap in their movies as far as writing the sfx make a tolerable film to watch and that is basically it jason momoa has charisma but the dialogue is so expositional so on the nose so boring and irritating for every characterand where is the character development jason momoas arthur has an arc but everyone else is onedimensional in wonder woman we saw what could be added to the story when the supporting cast have backstories the arab with hollywood dreams but he is the wrong color the native american who has had everything stolen from him by people who look like the leads the ptsd sniper who cant shoot anymorea saving grace for this film i think would have been a little more focus on the pollution affecting ocean life the damage to the environment what is wrong with raising the iq level of a blockbuster film so it isnt just popcorn entertainmentyet is almost all visual effects and i guess it has to be since it mostly happens in a fictional underwater world there is barely a coherent story a special trident the surface world is evil war must be waged the mythology doesnt work for me and once again the dialogue is painful,fantasy
avoid this movie is bad from start to endbad acting bad scenario bad everything absolute cheesey,fantasy
dear marvel if youre worried about your superhero competition over at dc dont be while trying to be funny and have a tensionfilled plot they caused anxiety throughout the whole audience in which uncomfortable laughter was the only escape momoa did his best but it seemed like there wasnt even a script written poor julie andrews was disgraced by voicing a faceless monster while her legacy as mary poppins was shrouded by the new mary poppins returns which opened just days before so lets hope dc makes enough money to buy new writers and then maybe just maybe theyll draw a crowd back to the theatre,fantasy
the movie is visually well done with great cgi and thats about it started the movie and couldnt get passed the b grade acting however it did get better as the movie progressed even nicole kidman was terriblein this movie had never been to atlantis or met mera but in justice league he had the movie is suppose to take place after justice leagueover all not a very well done film in any way,fantasy
this film made me write my first ever review on this website the rating is clearly fake and conned me out of my money at the cinematerrbible  script acting plot charactor development timing musicgood  cgithe best thing i can take away from this film was when me and my girlfriend both turned to each other at the same time and burst into laughter at the scenes awful acting and cheesyness this film is soo badsave your time and money and go to your local aquarium it wont insult your intelligence like this garbage,fantasy
the opening of this movie really captures my eyes and the background music is excellent the scenes are gorgeous i would rather regarded it as an epic not typical superhero film the performance of jason momoa and amber heard is great i could not understand why people think momoa is handsome until i watch this movie and heard looks so awesome with redheadthe description of emotion is much more abundant and important than i thought and wan really did a great job of expressing the love of arthurs parents its undoubtedly the most touching part of the film i especially admire the way that wan uses and presents props and scenes in this film and the sense of destroying and grandiosity he tries to convey my favorite part of the film is the ocean monsters part and its really heartshakingbut for me the incongruity between sense of epic and superhero elements or modern elements is a little bit huge making me feel disharmonious in some scenes and the costumes of villains in atlantis are a little bit disharmonious too,fantasy
 is a great adventure of marvel with jason momoa in the lead role and directed by james wan the film works and is supported by great cast and special effects james wan shifts from horror genre and makes a good adventure film names such as willem dafoe patrick wilson nicole kidman and dolph lundgren support this great production with the gorgeous amber heard looking forward for the sequel my vote is eighttitle brazil,fantasy
just the same as usual from dc great visuals typical superhero origin story awful acting apart from and his dadand lots of bad casting dolph lundgren just cant act and as for the rest of the cast they arent much betterthe cliche music  when ocean master is said the changing of voices when under water and then you have the ending where all of a sudden everyone has a loud booming voice just by magic and the costume changes are just sillyand one of the questions i was left with was how did they get out of the desert,fantasy
the reviews on this site has to be bots i could not stop rolling my eyes and cringing during who the heck wrote the manuscriptto be honest i didnt expect a good dc movie although the effects were great but the way the characters spoke to each others was so unnatural and the storyline was so predictable i already knew i was gonna be disappointed but not this muchand furthermore the outfits all armour or whatever that the atlantians wear look like plastic and manta looked like an ant terrible,fantasy
if i could give this 010 i truly would i dont understand why its rated so highly the plot is rubbish scenes are straight rip offs from harry potter and completely unimaginative acting was atrocious cgi and special effects were truly horrid im not sure if its meant to be a comedy a super hero action movie its a confused sorry state of a movie a waste of time watch anything else but this,fantasy
watching amber heard was like watching a six year old read off a card during a grade school play she was terrible,fantasy
 is my least favorite movie of 2018 why it was boring the fighting for the most part looked extremely fake the cgi was awful although 3 minutes of the movie had gorgeous cgi in atlantis the acting is subpar the story ismeh characters are kinda bland its a step up from the other dc movies ive seen suicide squad and a bit of justice league and the cgi is better but it has a too many problems one positive to note is the final battle was decent,fantasy
trash awful acting cringe lines terrible cgi that came out from a playstation 2jason momoa and amber heard both have zero talent zero charisma and cant act,fantasy
i had seen other reviews of this movie and most said its so outrageous and entertaining others said it had great cgi so i went in expecting something at least entertaining i walked in to a packed theaterside note there was some old guy next to me making abunch weird noises so that was distractingacting some of the worst ive seen maybe ever literally no one is good sure the movie is entertaining but in all the wrong ways the dialogue is so horrible i was laughing at it a lot when everybody else was silent i couldnt contain my laughter the movie looks like a video game the cgi is not good the black manta guy has a generic motivation and is very uninteresting also it just rips off of black panther they thought if they did the black panther plot with abunch of fillet theyd get billions of dollars too but they missed the part that actually made black panther popular the black because all the people were african american it gave the black community someone to root for its not the highest grossing movie of the year because of its fantastic script aqua man tries to be all that and a bag of chips it isnt its too long stupid and just not worth the money,fantasy
 released in india one week before its us release and yet i watched it just a few days ago the imax 3d experience was just outstanding i wont be lying if i say i enjoyed the film to the core its a complete visual spectacle with lots of action and adventure great performances and direction made it stronger if you like superhero movies this is a must watchone of the best things about this film is that while most superhero movies do justice to the action aspects and the adventure aspect often gets overshadowed is a complete action adventure you dont just get breathtaking action set pieces but also a lot of enchanting locales the entire cgi work is impressive and thats another reason to watch it in imax 3djason momoa is very impressive as is amber heard their combo makes the story more fun as they go places willem dafoe is back with another solid act nicole kidman is quite good as are rest of the cast members james wan has done a great job with the direction by sticking to the plot and not resorting to unwanted subplots the background score is also very impressivei had seen and liked batman v superman justice league and man of steel but not on the big screen there was no way in which i could afford missing its a treat to the eyes and a perfect entertainer for the big screen from the action sequences to the adventure moments it will keep you on the edge of your seat,fantasy
i thought it was awesome visually cool the fight scenes were solid for me the music was a bit odd i found myself going ohthats an odd choice for this moment in the movie but still not badthe runtime of 25 hours actually works in my opinion i never sat there going alright lets get this over withits a simple movie that explains everything to you it gets all of the backstory stuff out if the way here you go he is everyone already kinda knows about him okay now to the action,fantasy
a great visual feast for all the dc fans deserves an oscar and dc is on right track,fantasy
one of the best movies i have ever seenfabulous acting by jason momoait will definitely hit the box officemust watch,fantasy
im 34 years old ive watched thousands of movies but this is my first review i felt that i had to do thative been following jason momoa since atlantis since nobody really knew him as we are lookalikes and people started calling me with his name all these years then came khal etci watched the 3d movie last night at cinema premier i caught myself crying at some moments i dont know the reason ive been waiting for this movie all this time and i felt reliefed all this hate about dc all these bad comments about the trailers the cgi etcbut let me unbiased the movie was amazing im still thinking about it today it finished and i stayed at my seat for 20 more minutesto be honest i dont really watch superhero movies neither big budget movies but with this one i felt differently it was more emotional the whole story about himself his mother etc it wasnt just an action moviethe action scenes were amazing the visuals stunning wan did an amazing job the story was good the pace im laughing with people calling the movie boringi know it has a good rating already beause of momoas fans mainly young girls but just watch it and dont listen to anyoneas for me i already bought a ticket to watch it again,fantasy
im either thinking dc hired a bunch of reviewspammers or i watched the wrong moviebecause the vibe i got was the room underwater oh hidialog was clunky as hell cgi looked like something from a videogame theres a huge resemble with the ps4 spiderman fightscenes and this nicole kidman washed up in a bathingsuit wouldnt her suit be part of her body it was almost like youd expect a zipper here plot was well it was weirdin general i felt like it was almost tipping over to be this badfunny movie like the room sharknado etcim amazed they let this through the editting room felt like some 10year old kid have approved this but maybe thats what people want i think ill just stop here wow,fantasy
fantastic cgi visual effect gorgeous and beautifulthe scenes are beautiful also the characters nicole amber are beautiful nicole and patrick are gorgeous willem also handsomeand jason last but not least is the best,fantasy
ugh the worst movie since sharkboy and lavagirl from beginning to end it is ridiculous the melodramatic script is so bad sometimes i actually sighed or groaned outloud other times i just stared at the seatback in front of me and considered leaving but i was in the middle of the theaterat times it was like combining the cool technology and weaponry of star wars with the cool neon world of avatar but trust me no amount of cgi can save you from the excessive absurdity you will experience scene after scene after sceneif you still decide to watch this film you will think of this review during the movie,fantasy
exquisite underwater world magnificent underwater wonders can be called  avatar underwater pandora underwater atlantean epic war is as powerful as star wars and lord of the rings the action drama reached its peak boxing reached the meat making people feel the shock of  steel body again the pursuit of the spaceship was dazzling and fascinating as if it had moved  speed and passion to the bottom of the sea the expedition to find trident is also fun and interesting and it is also the reappearance of indiana jones franchise the core of the film returns to the exploration of family and self  affirmation bearing growth and motherly love selfconfidence and affection the last scene was filled with tears just as thomas finally waited to meet his wife so did we wait for dcs best film in recent years wen ziren such as cameron and peter jackson possessed him took a master of action adventure fantasy super english and other elements it is one of the best superhero movies after  dark knight and the name of  will be remembered from this movie history,fantasy
quite possibly the worst movie ever wooden acting horrible dialogue all exposition depthless characters power ranger costumes slomo really sound design is a dubstep song mamoa sounds like puddy from seinfeld the dc universe takes another step back,fantasy
predictable waste of time felt drawn out with no excitement waste of money,fantasy
only the first like 20min was ok  the movie was so boring and predictable  the comedy was trash i couldnt wait for the movie to be over dc sucks they cant compete with marvel period ,fantasy
too much cgi boring just awful really with a poor story make sure youve had a lot of alcohol before watching to ensure this mediocre monstrosity,fantasy
initially myself and my friends were excited to watch the trailers really sold the film however what a flump it turned out to be full of awful cliches cringey one liners and lackluster special effects this film was an absolute waste of time and money it followed a generic plot of romanceheroism without adding anything extraordinary it was bland and tasteless dont be fooled by the high ratings it was the worst film we have ever seen,fantasy
i honestly dont know how this movie has so many 1010  although most of the reviews that are 1010 are from accounts that only reviewed suspiciousi actually just created this account to give the score this movie really deservesmy girlfriend and i couldnt stop laughing at how bad the movie is jokes that no one in the cinema laughed at abysmal sound track shallow plot and a lot of screen time that could be removed without any harm to the movie at allthere were some quite interesting scenes but they were rare and the rest of the awful ones are way more present,fantasy
the film overwhelms the viewer with an insane cgi firework to compensate for the poor and chaotic storyit seems as marvel sat together and the only goal was to pack everything the effect laybrary offers into this filmthe poor story unfortunately drags down the great caracters,fantasy
wow was i disappointed with this one perhaps if it started with the big final fight scene at the beginning im pretty sure it would have been more entertaining if jar jar binks was in it my son cant wait until we see it on mst3kreally hoped for a good one from dc but yet another miss i had to force myself from walking out,fantasy
was all i could think through the whole movie i was so bored the acting was awful what was supposed to be funny  wasnt underwater scenes were the highlight so wanted to love this but was bored after 20 minutes,fantasy
the scenes are visually appealing unfortunately the sounds were not i didnt enjoy the soundtrack throughout the movie the dialogue was cringy fortunately its a great movie for kidschildren as target audience  1010adults who think this movie is targeted for adults before watching it  210ps my husband really enjoyed the movie,fantasy
it wasnt horrible and it was even fun at times but one rotten tomatoes critic couldnt have been more accurate when he described the visual effects in this film as an awesome eye sore in concert with this idea this movie had more plot holes than swiss cheese and had such inconsistent pacing and narrative that i found myself either rolling my eyes or laughing my head off during scenes that were allegedly supposed to be emotionally jarring with that being said if you want to watch something with jason momoa just watch game of thrones,fantasy
let me start with this was one of the worst films yes films not just superhero movies but films ive ever seen i honestly dont know how its got so many 10 ratings im starting to think theres something seriously wrong with peoplethe film is ridiculously cheesy not well acted at all and so cliche it physically hurt me to watch at most points there were too many scenes that were just stupidly unrealistic i know im watching a film about a half breed atlantian superhero but have a touch of consistency like the scene where a 3 ton block of concrete lands on some guys legs and just lifts it off and he jumps up and runs off without a scratch on him i could go on but id be here all dayall in all i felt atlantis was too over done for me as was the cgi the storyline was weak clich and rushed and considering its the only film ive ever wanted to walk out from i think that says it all,fantasy
it has been on in china ziren wen is a fantastic dierecter because he creates a new world for aqua man the man living in the never land,fantasy
watched the movie in china i was impressed about visual effects characters costumes everything also the thing that they approached even if from far the way people throw the garbage into the water and how this affects the oceans and our planeti hope people will look deeper into the movies story line i found the best superhero movie because the actions take place in both worldsunder water and on the ground and this contrast is amazing thank you very much for such a good movie i havent seen in the last 2 years,fantasy
discombobulated story terrible music laughable at times acting is equally laughable loved this character growing up perplexed as to how they botched this one so terribly,fantasy
to start withthere have been some pretty big blockbusters that hit the theaters this yeari have not seen all of thembut almost all excluding a few dildosand right hereis an absolute joy for this christmasthe best movie of the year for mevisual jewelan absolute joyalso the best dc movie past a few years,fantasy
i dont believe it anymore im speachlessdont miss the movie,fantasy
its interesting to note that during the first months of a films release the studio floods imdb with fake reviews greatest movie ever ignore the haters ten out of tenhere is a real reviewthis is a cgi overblown loud badly written badly directed and with a few exceptions badly acted moviethe hero of the film was better off in game of thrones where he just needed to look mean most of the time and flex his movieswilliam defoe is badly miscast the story is confusing there are many many locations and there are three seperate bad guys it is a terrible mush mash and a shining example of why if you write the script you shouldnt also direct itat the start of the movie inthought i was going to enjoy what looked like an over the top humourous paradoy then i realised they werent jokingbecause i was given no interest in what happened to the characters i found the countless fights and battles boring i spent most of the movie closing my eyes and listening to the sound effects at times i was lucky enough to fall asleep which made this way too long film feel slightly shorterat this movie i had my first choc ice in many years an ice cream that cant be beat it is made to a consistent formulae given the amount of money and the top actors dedicated to this movie it left me wondering why they hadnt used a similar formulae and kept it simple instead we have one big watery mess,fantasy
short reviewwent to see the movie with zero expectations and i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised the storyline by it self is not something extraordinary or particularly captivating but doesnt fall flat either it even manages to get you emotional as wellwhile it has some funny or emotional bits the dialogue in its entirety seems to me a bit blank it is however a fast paced movie with high standard fighting choreography and what really elevates this movie its the exceptional visual effects  for a movie that takes place underwater it reminded me a lot like a space adventure quest overall its a very good superhero movie  in my opinion the best of dceu so far and better than a lot of mcu movies,fantasy
the dc universe has an uneven track record when it comes to recent film adaptations of its franchise for every wonder woman theres a batman vs superman or justice league thankfully for fans of these superheroes james wans is closer to the former than the latter at least in terms of entertainment valuewhile is pretty much billed as the jason momoa show the cast actually does an excellent job sharing the limelight even in the face of typically wooden dialogue amber heard and nicole kidman do their very best as royalty from the sea while patrick wilson surprises as scorned atlantean brother king orm  a role very different from those he is known for not to mention willem dafoe and dolph lundgren and a kraken voiced by none other thanjulie andrews as for villains yahya abdulmateen ii takes on the role of modernday pirate manta whose suit looks like it would be a better fit in a power rangers moviebut the cast is not the main attraction here  its the visuals its hard to imagine being filmed a decade ago when vince chase made it the biggest blockbuster in history on entourage the level of preciseness required to make the underwater worlds of atlantis and others come to life without coming off looking cheap is not to be taken for granted there is such detail included to ensure these scenes are believable that in some instances it comes off as pandoralike this alone makes seeing the film on the big screen worth the price of admissionas for the plot its your standard comic book fare with the hero story lifted from numerous films that have come before in this case the execution actually makes up for the poor storyline and scripting the soundtrack and score are also above average for a dc universe film with the only exception being a ridiculous interruption from a pitbull song that samples africa but why may not come anywhere close to the dark knight series or even hold a candle to some of the better quality marvel efforts but it surely is an entertaining ride that should be enjoyed for what it is,fantasy
 is one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time like 7 different movies in one dont waste the time or money,fantasy
james wan created a magnificient marvelous submarine world although the storyline is not innovative yet the saying goesone flaw cannot obsecure the splander of the diamond besides the visual effect and the music score are beyond imagination additionally the costume design make the undersea creasures vividly to the audience i really love the costume of princese mera in a word long live dc ps how can the queen seems younger than her little son pps vulko looks alike gareth bale,fantasy
i want 25 hrs of my life back it was so boring i kept trying to fall sleep but all couldnt because of all the loud noises its what i imagine being stuck in purgatory feels like needed more action and less plot didnt have time to process all the critical information,fantasy
new52 run was a fantastic moment for the character so it was definitely the best choice of story to adapt now heres the thing the entire run covered four graphic novels  25 issues  which is roughly two years of storytelling including a crossover with justice league which added another five or six issues thats huge its an epic story involving multiple smaller stories that all come together for the movie they came up with a story that was a combination of that entire 25issue run thats like trying to squeeze all three lord of the rings books into one movieokay i get it it was a loose adaptation for this very reason cliffnote the important parts and tie together into a cohesive narrative and i fully understand that things had to be moved about or cut out entirely in order to keep it manageable problem is thats an antagonist per graphic novel and we all know how the overabundance of villains affected spiderman 3 the movie wants to squeeze in his origin and the fate of his mother the trench black manta with his revenge for the death of his father and orm and his war on the surface world as antagonists thank goodness they gave up on the idea of squeezing in the dead king as well and never even bothered with vulkos betrayal explore all seven kingdoms and establish a romance between arthur and mera its too much to put into one movie especially one as crazy and outlandish as this it devolves the plot into a series of checkpoints that are all rushed through to get to the conclusion meaning no moment is given time to breathe none of the villains feel particularly well developed arthur and meras romance comes off as forced the effects of everything on the outside world are completely forgotten about early on is just ferried from point a to point b to point ccompounding this lack of space and atmosphere in the storytelling is the overdone formula of interruption by which i mean if you took a shot everytime a serious moment was undercut by a cheesy oneliner or a section of dialogue gets interrupted by an explosion youd be paralytic by the time the credits rolled it was cool and unexpected the first time it happens but by the third time it just got boring i know a movie featuring armoured sharks and a drumming octopus felt boring how do you even manage thatto continue the criticisms what little immersion i had in this movie was completely broken by the nonsensical choice of licensed music the use of sigur ros early on was a masterstroke i was completely behind really suiting the scene it was put over but then they lost their way and put in upbeat depeche mode over black manta building his suit after the death of his father or getting pitbull to samplecover africa by toto what and skylar greys everything i need made the film feel like a romcom once the credits rolled for one these songs were awful but secondly they were just completely wrong for their scenes the musics not all bad though rupert gregsonwilliams score is actually pretty good not hans zimmer johann johannsson or even michael giacchino levels of good but by the halfway point it was his score that was keeping my sole interest going yeah in a way it does sound like they saw thor ragnarok and frantically tried to squeeze in as much 80s synth as they could but ill be honest i think gregsonwilliams melded the 80s synth into the typical orchestral score much better than mark mothersbaugh didand thats not my only praise either the opening ten minutes or so sold me instantly that this could exceed my admittedly low expectations the scenes between nicole kidmans queen atlanna and temuera morrisons tom curry were so charming and brimming with chemistry that you couldnt help but root for their romance when atlantis eventually came calling we got a kickass fight scene with atlanna acrobatically bouncing all over the house in a composite longshot fending off the attackers and saving her family all at once unfortunately this was just about the highest point for me arthur beating on manta senior and junior and their crew was pretty badass too but after that all the action scenes lost their gravity literally underwater battles should be super cool right but i actually got kind of bored of them because there was no weight to any of the choreography they just fly all over the place none of the punches felt like they landed and the breaking of atlannas trident was only impactful because of its emotional implication for arthuranother mote of praise i have this time without any kind of criticism attached was the visuals rushed story awful music choices and weightless action scenes aside is a devastatingly pretty movie to look at the use of bright neon colours really gave it its own visual identity each of the seven kingdoms are designed so uniquely from one another that you can tell where you are at a glance arthur and mera diving deep while being swarmed by the trench is wallmountingly gorgeous imagery of course theres the inherent concept of world as well with armoured sharks a drumming octopus and soldiers riding giant seahorses atlantis looks truly mythological and the cgi underwater hair is flawless far better than other attempts in the likes of inhumans or even the otherwise fantastic arrivali cant say i was disappointed in as i already had pretty rockbottom expectations it starts out incredibly strong but it quickly goes downhill as they try to squeeze way too much into the story forcing it to rush from plot point to plot point its formulaic and badly written with some truly cringeworthy dialogue a forced romance and lofty action sequences that were frankly boring to watch its a really prettylooking movie though with some fantastic cgi and set designs and every character is brought to life visually i give a bad 410 its not the worst youll see but goddamn i wish i had gone to see into the spiderverse instead,fantasy
best cbm since batman v superman visual are stunning,fantasy
so bad we walked out after 1st half this is the worst dc could get worst the entire superhero genre could get cheesy cliched punchlines and overdone cgi bs ugh why just why or how can someone work  make a film without any passion or care or love this film lacks a soul simple save yourselves time and money winterishere,fantasy
the dialogues are really bad repetitive simplistic and absolutely explicit in their meaning there is nothing left for your imagination to figure outthe plot is thin there are no changes in pace no deeper meaning the deepest phrase in the whole movie is atlantis needs more than a king and thats already in the trailerin fact this movie is fully contained and defined by its trailer the best scenes are already there and the rest is filler material you are better off just filling the gaps of the trailer with your imaginationim giving it 2 stars for the cgi character design which is good but i think this movie is just a complete waste of cgi resources trying to save a script that looks written by a 12 year oldso you know where im coming from so far my favorite movies in this dc universe are man steel and wonder woman justice league and batman vs superman are rubish this is the last dc movie im wasting my money on,fantasy
i really like james wan i thought the conjuring films were excellent so i went to this thinking it would be as good i was wrong the movie feels like it was made for dc fans only who may have some knowledge of his back story how exactly did arthur become whats with the tattoos all over his body was he born with them did he get dragged to a tattoo parlor in a drunken stupor by his friends how are and the others able to breathe underwater there seems to be no cohesive story line either something to do with becoming king of atlantis also plenty of gratuitous explosions occurring throughout the movie like watching a video game the movie just seemed to consist of randomly strung together scenes without any semblance of a story by the midpoint of the movie and its a long movie i found myself checking my watch every five minutes really not a good film,fantasy
where do i start the is a fun movie that dc actually got right i do not want to spoil anything plot wise at all but this is a good one hopefully they can build off of this and wonder woman to build a better dc universe jango fett was great as abin sur err papa and jason mamoa is the perfect choice to bring this character to lifeone minor spoiler release the kraken,fantasy
just saw it 2 hours ago and boy oh boy was i blown away exquisite cinematography  amazingly tense script and wonderful actingit is just as good or even better than any movie competitor marvel has produced till date the story arc and character story is excellent i love this movie along with wonderwoman and both these characters are going to help dc in the long rundont miss it just go and watch itrecommended ,fantasy
this isnt just the worst dc movie i have ever seen but quite possibly the worst movie i ever seenstoryline predictable acting wooden and visual effects atrocious just wait until you see nicole kidmans face in the first ten minutes,fantasy
shocked to see so many 1010 ratings this movie is a sad mix of clichs and genres sad because its not good as any genre the action is too micro or macro no chemistry in love aspect humor lines come as jarringly at inappropriate moments and no twists at all with such movies dc might sink for good and thats the only good thing about this movie,fantasy
after doing such a good job in making i hope james wan addresses the mess thats been made of superman we need to bring back superman in all his glory including a new costume the one cavil wears is a joke,fantasy
byebye snyderwelcome james wan in dceu totally refresh dceu movie after the jl with very good jokes various story line and very very amazing sea battle i like it very much,fantasy
jason momoa has brought his charm talent and draw to the warner bros dc comics slate when was first announced the studio was under the microscope wb has not been known for its superhero movies unlike its major competitor marvel with however they hoped to change all that,fantasy
before seeing this movie i told several friends that based on the trailer will etheir be an awesome movie or a huge cheese festit was a cheese fest the moment they introduce the redhead the female interest it slowly devolves into a huge cheese festeven my 16 year old son was rolling his eyesi wont go into details i dont wont to spoil any of the storyline im just not certain what others saw that they would rate this cornball movie so highly but be warnedits cheesy and i told you so,fantasy
great film great visuals and great storyjust go and watch itits worth it,fantasy
after what has been a selection of bad movies from the dceu this one feels completely different in the correct way id actually say its better than some of the more recent marvel movies if you can believe that this movie feels very much like a good marvel phase 1 movie its a fun colorful movie with great action scenes and good cgi,fantasy
 then this film will deliver not so sure of those who say this is better than the dark knight though its quite generic but manages to be refreshing and new overall an entertaining addition in a year where most movies were garbage,fantasy
this movie was a big disappointment after reading reviews on here claiming it to be 1010 and the best dc film to date i was excited to go see it even though i do not have any comic book knowledgethe film started off interesting a story was building to a point and then it fell of the wagon completelycharacters were very poorly introduced and since i have no real knowledge of some of these characters it was very difficult to form connections with them the background of the characters even of some of the main characters is very vague and this made me lose interest early on into the filmthe storyline was very predicatable also very unrealistic and not well thought out in some cases its not really known why characters do certain things or how they get from place to place its very wishy washy unfortunely i grew bored very quickly the movie did not grab my attention the fights were average and long winded the writers tried to incorporate jokes and humour but it was not very good the imagery was confusing at times  in the end it was just a grey bluri dont know man i wanted to be the next wonder woman  it had the potential but irritating villains villains that looked like antman and predictable plots ruined it for me i wont even spend money on 2 if it was ever produced,fantasy
visuals the visuals is mindblowing wan has created a world rich in colour vibrance and depth the details are astounding best visually insane movie since avatarstory predictable a bit yes but which superhero movie is not is it predictable from the beginning  nohumor not cheesy as some reviews say the humor doesnt feel forced like with some marvel movies the movie will give you 2 hours of joy ride and youll never regret the money or time spent on itemotional depth the movie already has an emotional corethe connection of arthur and his parents although its not that much emotionally resonant it does a good job of balancing the tonevillain the villain has a real good reason hes also right in some ways although not in his solution plans all his rage can be felt with his words id compare his character to mcus killmonger who also lives and fights for a cause and while in the black panther movie for some people some things feels like a racial agenda and sees the white people as the bad guys in all the surface dwellers are seen as the bad guys in the view of the villain theres no feel of any agenda or anythingverdict 1010 everything is awesome and purely mind blowing while still delivering a message which affects the real world,fantasy
watch it on big screen you wont regret it characters are rich and goodlooking the story is simple and clean the picture and colours are greati seriously cant stand some crazy marvel fans behaviours some people did not even watch the movie and gave one star and said some shady things about dc having a stereotype refusing to give a great movie a chance and simply giving a judgement by some silly things like team dc or team marvel that is the definition of being stupid,fantasy
it has good moments it certainly starts strong but it just dragged for tooooo long and the story line gets messy and boring i checked my watch several timesand i cannot believe no one mentions anything about costume design theyre just so lame and cheap kinda ruins the film for meanother thing bugs me is the bland romance i love jason momoa i certainly think the princess is very beautiful but they have zero chemistry just no,fantasy
i watched it yesterday highly recommend it i think this is the best dceu movie not including nolans batman for now way better than the justice league i am surprised that it costs like only half of the justice league,fantasy
loved every second of it  the visuals were amazing and i really liked the cast,fantasy
its a visual feast and entertaining  cat performance was fantastic under water scenes were amazingly done,fantasy
proved to be a tremendous effort by the cast and everyone involved it was worth the wait better than expected jm is the king of the seven seas indeed,fantasy
this is my first time giving a reviewthis movie has all the elements that you need for a superhero film which is a perfect balance it has sentiments humor fun and serious should be watched in theatre for great experience first of all james wan is the man he had taken the risk and courage to bring this superhero to life aqua man was the least appreciated superhero before but now it has changed wan did the magic making the character lovable like how robert downey jr made us like iron mannow to the main partthe script is simple it doesnt mean it is bad it is simply good with this simple script wan had delivered an extraordinary way of storytelling which is enganging and makes us glued to the seat till the very end the narration the vfx and whole are in the next level we dont feel any lag as the story is taking us to an whole new adventurethe actors did their part very well especially mamoa and heard patrick wilson and yahya did their job well no words to explain how good they arethe chemistry between amber and jason is very well executed i didnt feel the jokes were forced even if it is it doesnt matter muchas i said the movie has the perfect balance in emotion love action adventure humor and serious this movie wont be a let down for anyone who had watched or who is planning to watch it thanks to james wanpraises to the whole casts vfx team and one and only james wan for giving us the wonderful rideand to those who are degrading the moviedont you feel ashamed of yourself for degrading a movie which is good in every wayto the people who are reading thisdont listen to the critics they are giving lame execuses for not liking this movie follow your instinct and dont judge the book by its coverits dc man,fantasy
review uk release date 14 december 18stand back superman iceman and spiderman because is finally here but is it as good as the hype suggestsi dont know about you but we are being overwhelmed at the moment with various superhero films from both marvel and dc and after watching these films time and time and time and you get the idea they just merge into the samei did wonder how would do because we have already been introduced to him in i forget the film so this is definitely a back storyfrom the first fight in the lighthouse to the very end this is a spectacular not to be missed especially the fight scenes across the roof tops wowbasically you have 6 stories in this filmthe back story ofthe love storythe sea world trying to destroy the land wouldthe revenge plotthe environmental aspect of what we are doing to our oceansthe search for the missingno spoilersthere dig at trump about the bridge no spoilersthere is a lot going on and the entire film keeps your interest from start right to the very endonly 1 criticism it is a very very long film but the way the stories interact even though there is a lot happening the separate stories are easy to follow allowing the film to culminaterating and i honestly cant recall me ever giving a superhero film this scorerating 9 out of 10,fantasy
lets start with the positive things about this movie the credits at the beginning and jason momoas gigantic pecs also amber heard lungs are quite interesting if youre expecting more you might be disappointed no storyline dialogues are written by a five yearsold and it is a succession of embarrassing moments never ending thank you interns from dc for creating this,fantasy
wow this was a rip roaring adventure ride easily the best dc movie in years visuals are stunning and jason momoa is the perfect person for i definitely need to see this again and for all the reviewers that said this was boring you must have left your humanity at home this was brilliant,fantasy
this movie was just epic jason was perfect writing plot and visuals were easily the best of dcu and almost at the top of mcuoverall this film was perfect finally dc did something good i would give this a 9310 ,fantasy
the villian literally tries to save his people  he has a good motive and good reason  the land people are spoiling the environment of the sea people  which we all are familiar with the hero without giving any alternatives to save his people or bringing the issue to land people  blindly has a motto to defeat his brother no twists or turns in story  only visualsboring screenplay,fantasy
yet another piece of excellent cinema from dcalthough somewhere lagging in storyline but still the graphics and fantasy tint served in near to real experience hallmark of dc give u a full on entertainment of 2 and a half hoursjason momoa at his best and not to forget amber heard as the woman counterpart of jason,fantasy
i have been following dceu since its implementation in 2013 with the film man of steeli can assure you that is undoubtedly one of the best films of this universe,fantasy
wow the only thing good in this film is nicole kidman who is an extraordinary actress other than that the movie is a mess of crappy redundant fight scenes unbelievably bad cgi garbage that should go down in history as the most horrible cgi ever poor writing and just a plain bad productionthe story is predictable and dumb oh and poorly toldi was bored out of my mind if you actually liked this movie there is something slow about you,fantasy
whats it aboutthe latest attempt by dc to right the course of their upanddown cinematic universe directed by bigname horror director james wan saw furious 7 tells the story of the titular character played by jason momoa mostly referred to by his human namearthur curryas he reluctantly begins to accept his destiny as the heir to the throne of atlantis amber heard costars as mera an undersea princess trying to guide curry while patrick wilson plays orm the main villain and yahya abdulmateen ii plays black manta in a secondary villain role willem dafoe and dolph lundgren also play smaller but important roles and temuera morrison and nicole kidman round out the list of stars as currys human father and atlantean mother respectivelywhat worksgiven that much of the action takes place in atlantis and other varied undersea kingdoms the visuals were where this movie was going to live or die fortunately this is an absolutely spectacular movie to look attheres hardly any cracks in a really impressive cgi faade and the use of color and other visual elements to build an engaging realfeeling setting is equally impressive in short this movie is gamechanging in the scope and effectiveness of its visuals for me someone whos never read an comic whos never really thought about what atlantis should look like this was a wholly convincing depiction of the undersea world even the character movements gliding and hovering through the water felt mostly natural and the dialogue was given just a hint of the normal distortion youd hear underwaterwhile the visuals were necessary to make this movie work theres more to making a good movie than just pretty imagery most of the time especially with a superhero action movie something trying to connect with a very wide viewer base the movie has to check a few more boxes fortunately it also does a pretty good job with its characters especially himself the character is written in a slightly unusual wayhes not a classic supermantype saving the world because its the right thing to do but neither is he a broody antihero type hes freespirited and energetic but likes to maintain a lower profile in the surface world hes goofy but motivated and confident this of course makes it the perfect role for jason momoa who plays the role with a perfect sort of cocky charm he also spends a decent chunk of the movie shirtless and hes a hunky man hes also allowed to be a funny character mostly played as a loosecannon fishoutofwater groundhogofftheearth relative to the rigidly hierarchical traditional rulebound undersea peoples its a line of humor that could easily grow tiresome but one which is used sparingly and therefore effectively its also worth pointing out that the undersea world doesnt come off as too stilted or outdatedit gets some satisfying chances to push back on his behavior in places which also happens to allow for some solid character development moments as tries to learn his place as someone with powerful ties to both the undersea and surface worldsthe other characters are also mostly at least solid amber heards mera is probably the next most important of the heroes she plays the role well but its an unfortunate inevitability that a good chunk of her dialogue is just exposition given that her role especially in the first half is explaining the rules of the undersea kingdoms to but in the latter half of the movie she gets a couple moments to shine moments which she takes full advantage of temuera morrison and nicole kidman are good in their own ways as parents one standout is willem dafoes vulko an advisor to the atlantean throne and former mentor to the young his character has some interesting moments and good twists along the waybut as is the case with most superhero movies the true test of its quality is going to be the villains i was worried going in that patrick wilson would not be a good choice for orm the primary villain but he is intensely compelling both as politician and warrior bringing a quiet ferocity in his dialogueheavy scenes but a vicious confidence in his action ones building a very strong primary villain and one who even gets some good character moments plus he looks great in the full ocean master armor once he breaks that outyahya abdulmateen ii is also solid as iconic villain black manta though it sometimes feels like his character isnt necessary he has a commanding screen presence especially in the excellent opening sequence but when hes allowed to function as a true villain he often comes off a bit monologuey and underwritten though a powerful enemy he really shines though when hes allowed to take off the helmet and do some real acting giving the character more depth and weight than it needed im also really glad the decisionmakers behind the movie were willing to eventually go allin on the big comicaccurate black manta helmetthe plot is mostly just adequate and generic but it hits several of its emotional beats with resounding force the ending is of particular notewithout giving anything away it takes a clich framework and plays it really effectively before breaking it off in an unexpected manner one that leaves the viewer startled by some unusual but effective emotional questionsone last crucial selling point for any superhero movie is going to be the action here again shines the massivescale undersea battles are impressively constructed being sure to maintain some semblance of tactical order while keeping a characterfocused perspective but the cgi overload does tend to wear by the end the real selling point however is the closequarters combat even the openings expositional setup has a beautiful longtake fight sequence and it only gets better from there the fighting is often done with tridents and the choreography and execution is superb fastpaced but feeling realistic and visceral and it always utilizes superb camerawork james wan is a director who likes to play with his toys and the sheer joy of creating some of these sequences is beautifully evident onscreen even the slow motion is handled with both care and obvious excitement showing off some great moments while never becoming quite gratuitousthe music also deserves a mention rupert gregsonwilliams who also scored wonder woman is in solid form here several moments in the score are notably strong and there are no obvious missteps he might not be ready to supplant john williams or hans zimmer quite yet but hes definitely deserving of more attention and workwhat doesnt workas i mentioned a few paragraphs before the plot is mostly just generic fare find the magic item beat the bad guy become the chosen one you were always meant to be part of the problem is that this is a movie that had to do a lot of thingsdevelop its main character establish a massive and complex world introduce and develop two villains and give their villainous plots enough weight to feel like a threat to the hero with all that going on its no wonder that the core plot was going to be a little simple its not quite justice leaguelevels of simplisticity but it probably is ultimately more of a weakness than a strength even if it was an inevitability given the volume of other details and characters and subplots surrounding the main narrativeanother problem with a movie trying to do as much as is that there is bound to be some tonal inconsistency the main chunk of the movie feels like an amalgamation of a mainstream superhero movie a lord of the ringsstyle fantasy epic with game of thronesstyle fantasy politics while also bringing scifi action and worldbuilding of the sort we should have gotten from the star wars prequels that core combination though works surprisingly well its when the movie starts dropping in scenes reminiscent of indiana jones or journey to the center of the earth that things start to feel like too much or when it takes a brief detour into otherwiseeffective moments straight out of the romcom or horror genres each of the bits taken on its own works at least fairly well especially the horror bit but there are some inevitable jarring tonal shiftswith any movie of this scale and ambition there are inevitably going to be at least a couple weak points in the visual effects while again the effects are almost uniformly astounding there are one or two odd pointsan unsatisfying movement here or there a giant cgi monster that doesnt feel entirely present an early scene in an aquarium has some uncannylooking sharks but really thats it and thats just nitpickingbut is it any goodit is its not a perfect movie by any stretch but it does a fair job with most things and it does a couple of the big thingsvisuals action main characterexceptionally well even the problems are mostly inevitable byproducts of bold exciting decisions elsewhere in the film that end up mostly outweighing the costs of the unintended consequences on the whole its probably not quite on par with wonder woman though there might be an argument in that direction but its definitely in the same ballparkanother clear winner for dc and a definite step forward for a universe that finally seems to be finding its feet,fantasy
it is easy to consider the first act of the mevie slow but in fact is aware that arthur was already stablished not in a particular good way and now needs depth therefore the beginning is made to reaffirm arthurs motivations reassuring the audience trust on the character and to introduce new characters whose archetypes have already been seen plenty of times wich its not a bad thingin the second act its clear to the audience that is a action packed movie who tells the storie of a long gone heir to some throne that comes to save the kingdom from a mistake slash uncontrolled tyrant nonetheless delivers a visually stunning experience and even though its hard to fear for the life of the characters its easy to be engaged with the narrative and crave to now what comes nextthe third act at last is amazing in so many aspects the climax is setup with such finesse that it is hard not to be lost on your own thoughts while processing the amount of that the movie deliversin conclusion is easily one of if not the most comic book like movie ever made james wan delivers a amazing movie full of good fight scenes heartfelt moments realy good cinematography and inspiring art most importantly seems to be made of comic pages something that every movie who adapts a comic book should have as it ultimate goal,fantasy
i was pleasantly surprise by this movie great action great choreography wonderful sets terrific battles like it so much it was my first uhd bluray purchase worth a watch,fantasy
excellent movie money well spend best on big screen good visuals audio storyline excellent direction love the background music,fantasy
i enjoyed watching this movie storyline was good and action was entertaining however i felt it could have been more maybe my expectation were too high going in definitly worth the watch would recommend,fantasy
this film is worth watching for the remarkable production design alone it is not an easy feat to make a film where half of the action takes place underwater but here excels gorgeous visuals incredible underwater battle sequences and wellchoreographed fights make this film impossible to look away fromthat said the plot is fairly basic reluctant hero doomed mentor unexpected love interest bad guy who wants to take over the world etc is surprisingly likable much different from his closedoff justice league persona but hes not particularly clever he kind of just goes with the flow punching bad guys as he goes there are various attempts at injecting humor into the script but its not very smart  especially compared with the witty comic brilliance of the recent deadpool guardians and antman filmsone aspect of the film that was done surprisingly well was black mantas origin story not that he has much competition but hes the best dceu villain weve met thus far,fantasy
vfx mind blowingamber heard dceu should think about another man of steel in want stylemight be dceu 1 billion  moviebest dceu comic character based movie since nolans dark knight series ,fantasy
i came into the theatre expecting to hate the movie and for it to be a continuation of the disappointment i have felt for most other dc movies but i was very pleasantly surprised to find that this movie was actually very entertaining and exiting to watch it still used the tired parent problems that plague dc but somehow it didnt bother me this time,fantasy
action packed over and over and over again it kept me in suspense due to action scenes i laughed i cried and i was very glad i came to watch this on christmas day ,fantasy
good movie well directed  could have trimmed a little lenght,fantasy
just watched the movie and i am still spellbound the best dc film since wonder woman the cinematic experience of the movie is awesome and incomparable and i believe that it would definitely be termed as the avatar of comic genrethe story is good if not greatwith cliches casting and acting are awesome the biggest win of the movie is not only the vfx but also the right casting i like willem dafoe but the could have been joker is the pick of the lot apart from momoa mera is badassand yeah the battle for atlantis is on par with lotr this is the main and most important draw of the moviethe credit scenes are not connecting the movie to the worlds of dc cinematic universe as if now but definitely setting up the base for would be trilogy of the sea worldyou are gonna love this but please lock the prejudice mind of yours in a box and throw that in the ocean ,fantasy
this movie shows warners determination on hero movies i should say i enjoyed but i really doubt this movie would be a new peak which means it will be very possible we wont see another dc movie can exceed this one auqaman set an unfair high step for its brother movies just like the trilogy did to the following dc movies all these years,fantasy
the best dc movie after dark night ww mos bvs  dont trust on reviews is best,fantasy
ignore the 110 and 1010 reviews this movie is not better than the dark knight 910 imdbusing common sense the best can be is a 710 given that imho its not better than wonder woman which has an imdb rating of 7510now on to the spoiler free review itselfthe good1 the visuals2 jason mamoa distant 2ndthe bad1 the overall story2 character development3 forced dialoguejokes4 unnecessary plot points which probably help contribute to5 undeveloped story arcsthe ugly1 the manta story arcthere is a lot that i didnt like which i cant get into without going into spoilers,fantasy
nearly 2 and a half hours it was great until it just became too damn long trust me i totally looked forward to this movie i was really over it at 155 of the movie if it wasnt as long i probably would have enjoyed it a lot more,fantasy
zeker een vette film bewte wat dc tot nu toe heeft gedaan zeker een aanrader,fantasy
good movie seen it on a boring thursday afternoon the story is well writen good visuals great acting overall above expectationsdc needs a great batman moviewith affleck and maybe a young batman in the story and theyll be back in track well see,fantasy
it does amaze me to see so many reviews that one way or another comes from the studio theyre so easy to spot but i guess it helps to balance things out from the trolls who love to give good films a one ratingquick review the first half was a bit sluggish with a super hero film who either need a bunch of super heroes which helps to move things around or you need a good number of scene changes to keep the audiences interest mortal engines did a very good of moving from one scene to another introducing new things into the mix it did mostly fail on the story so the first half of was a bit weak because it didnt move well the 2nd half did a much better job moving things around the world and introducing new scenery above the ground below the ground and beneath the sea the visuals were absolutely amazing i thought the score was a bit weak some of the songs were thrown into a scene and then crawled away felt a bit off there were some good laughs along the way and as we find out to along the way the creatures that live beneath the sea are a lot more complicated than we mightve believed i found the scene in italy to be the best over the seas i thought the development of mantra was weak and certain parts of that story were a bit confusing overall a very entertaining film in the end,fantasy
this movie serves us great story visuals characters and excitement i loved this movie and its well directed dialogue were little off sometimes but it was not realized while u are enjoying a epic and joyful adventure of worth seeing this,fantasy
 beats all other dc movies hands down jason really justified his role as the king of the seas,fantasy
very exciting and it kept me at the edge of my seat manta is a little bigger than life and could be toned down a little but besides that it is a wonderful film the ending is so surreal i love comics and marvel had dc by the balls they have come back and dc i hope they continue to shine,fantasy
first the negatives has a ridiculously complicated script is too long and full of plot holes the film is at times visually derivative ripping off various better films like thor ragnarok the hobbit and the matrix and is highly predictable the cgi is also ridiculously over the top in places dont watch this if you are expecting anything originalnow the plus side jason momoa is a piece of inspired casting he has the look and charisma of the halfbreed atlantean willem dafoe and nicole kidman give their characters some real gravitas and dolph lundgren is a natural fit for his role the dialogue is occasionally clunky but having established actors like these deliver them does help make it not so obviousi hope we see more of jason momoa in the role he has a charm and lightness of touch that is welcome much like chris hemsworths thor id like to see more witty one liners as he delivers the few he has very wellnot a perfect film and wonder woman is still the dc high spot in terms of recent films but delivers action and character even if there is still room for improvement if there is to be a sequel i hope dc will improve on this decent first effort,fantasy
great cinematography checkamazing cgi checkengaging content checkthis movie has all the elements of a great blockbuster admittedly the romance between arthur and mera seems a bit forced and cliched but the movies makes up for it on all other aspects it retains enough of the original lore to keep comic fans engrossed while keeping the general audience hookedwith the obvious comparisons that will be made to the mcu this movie can easily hold its own among the likes of thor and avengers,fantasy
i actually saw this film as i had to take my mother to see it because she is a huge jason momoa fan she first saw him as ronon in stargate atlantis and well i guess my mom likes fantasy and scifi go figure anyway i did not have great expectations but as it turns out it was actually quite goodmomoa basically steals the show hes pretty awesome as his portrayal of as a tough but tongue in cheek super hero is really good basically he nails itregarding mera all i can say is that amber heards acting is at best bland i would have loved to see emily blunt as mera she is a much much much much better actress and could have easily pulled this character out of the mediocrity heard gave it in all honesty has heard managed to actually act in any movie she has had a role in  i think she is by far the lowest point in the movie unfortunately it is a leading role and it does hurt the movieanother low is in my opinion excessive violence it is gratuitous unnecessary pointless and does not add anything to the movie i will not let my son see it hes 5 and way too young for this kind of violence if theres a lego version i will certainly let him see thatthe rest of the actors do a really great jobvisuals are a mixed bag though as they are at times quite amazing almost on an avatar lotr level but at other moments they are not that good specially when they modify some of the characters faces nicole kidman willem defoe temuera morrison etc as they try to make them younger and it does not work at all but overall the visuals are really good except for these aforementioned lets call them minor let downsall in all it is a very good movie it also leaves the door very widely open for 2 which i will definitely watchgo watch it its good fun dont take young kids though,fantasy
best dc film great origin and story telling setting up a better dcmu,fantasy
one of the more colourful of recent dc films action packed and delightfully predictable in the way that superhero quest type films are i liked that isnt the standard straight laced superhero but more of a grey areamarked down for repetitive use of the same jump scare for want of a better word any time 2 characters usually arthur and mera got close and lingered for a second or more something exploded great effect the first time but it was then used another four or five times throughout making it obvious,fantasy
after a series of disappointing weak plot lines james wan comes to the rescue its the best second movie after man of steels debut in the dceu i hope they continue on the pace for the movies to come or at least maintain it it might help them to learn some tricks from their long reigning nemesis the mcu,fantasy
loved the story the humor the action the build up and choice of actorsall i can say watch it it will not disappoint you,fantasy
the dceu hasnt made the greatest of films so far only creating decent superhero movies however non comparing to marvels level but now has shown how great the dceu can be providing they put the money into it and have a great director like james wan the cgi in was way better than justice leagues especially the large fight scenes if future dceu movies are like this then the franchise should be set back on track,fantasy
kind is the one who protects the kingdom but hero is the one who protects everyone with high expectations after five minutes trailer had kept its promise james wan direction and the screenplay makes audience feel extraordinary non stop action sequences in 3d and background music makes movie much more interesting i feel no critic can give negative review for this film very happy that india got early chance to watch the movie after watching post credit scene eagerly waiting for 2,fantasy
only minor spoilers aheadi agree that i was sceptical when i heard that james wan is going to direct the guy who was famous for  saw insidious conjuring annabelle lights out  all out dark horror movies i mean if you take out furious 7 from the list the guy is almost completely dealing with horror stuff the only plus point that i saw there was that all of them were dark and the dc verse is supposedly dark things got worse when i saw the trailer and saw some altered old school scuba divers as villains i mean it did look like black manta from the comics but to cast something that dramatic from a comic into a movie usually calls for disaster and in the trailer there were underwater shots of atlanta that reminded us of avatar and a gigantic crab that reminded me of wrath of the titans  so now you see my dilemma before watching the movie  it could be an avatar or a wrath in the waitingbut my oh my this fellow blew my mind completely right now i believe this movie can bring back the dc movie verse from close to deathafter watching due to early release in india the one word that is still ringing in my head is  magnitudethe sheer magnitude of the sets the stunts and the visuals got my jaw dropped there were a lot of wow moments and more than once did i think about the scale of the underwater world that he is trying to show to us for instance theres one scene where a giant blue whale looking like a fish when it swims past one of those fallen atlantan statues under the sea at that moment you will invariably compare the sizes in your mindi would say james wan has successfully compiled avatar the titan movies pacific rim godzilla a bit of tintin indiana jones stuff a pinch of harry potter lol  all into one short fun packed movie there is fantasy future tech in its own way adventure creature stuff scary stuff and breathtaking visuals and thankfully you wont feel that they have made it all too sweet for a pg13 rating it is just the right amount of actionoh thanks for reading that much  as a dc fan now you are probably thinking like  i know all that from the trailer but what about the superhero stuff what about did he pull it offmy simple answer is a firm yesfor a start this was the one of those films where i waited to see who the casting directors were in the end credit applauds to anne mccarthy  kellie roy personally i felt all the actors were spot on for their roles  nicole kidman back in the dc world as atlanna and yahya abdulmateen ii as black manta steals the show in the opening moments amber heard as mera was convincing patrick wilson as the rogue brother was a decent choice and for a change you will get to see willem defoe aka norman osborne from mcu and dolph lundgren drago from rocky in different roles though its hard to spot dolph in his new looksthe towering dothraki khal drogo  jason momoa  to top it off he is literally like a character walking out of a comic book with those chiselled muscles and the looks along with some pretty decent acting skills he has a few comic oneliners too he seems to have understood the depth of the character well and we will see him switching from the ignorant metahuman to the king of atlantis along the way theres a pretty decent back story similar to wonderwoman and a save the world from pollution theme to hold on to so overall the movie has a pretty solid basethere are some minor flaws like too many things going on in the final fight but certainly not as bad as man of steel or bvs here it is simply because of the same magnitude that i mentioned earlier and there are some spacegame like action sequences even the bgm at that time seems odd but i think it might have been intentional  but those are very trivial onesoverall it is an entertaining dc movie and we feel like we are watching a true comic adaptationso now you see dcs dilemma now  in the next jl movie  wonderwoman and will be running the show unless the bat and the man of steel proves us wrongi rate it 4 out of 5 watch it on a big screen to feel the magnitudeps just one advice to all of you  please do not watch the trailers for dc movies they simply reveal too much every single time,fantasy
this film has received mixed reviews from the critics and after watching it not sure why the negative ones is a solid superhero film yes you could say we have seen it all before but that doesnt make it any less fun jason maoma is brilliant at playing the strong yet dump arthur curry the story is very solid and makes good use of the main villain oceanmaster and side one blank manta the visuals in the film are brilliant you truly believe that it takes place under the ocean the film passes by really quickly with a good amount of action and humour easily one of the best dc films of recent years and a good superhero film would recommend for anyone who is a fan of comic book films,fantasy
every scene is a beautiful wallpaperamaze by every fight sceneand variable sea creaturescant imagine how good this movie isof coursebeautiful actresses are very importanttoo,fantasy
they killed it fantastic story beautiful art and killer soundtrack i was on the fence for this but man i will see it again soon thanks to amazon prime for allowing is members to have an early screening tonight this is by far one of my favorite super hero films to date watch it,fantasy
i saw an early showing through amazon no spoilers what a fantastic telling of story actors were great story was great cgi and sound was great it was an enjoyable cinematic experience while staying true to the characters comic book origins jason mamoa is awesome as i say let james wan take over the dceu bring on justice league 2 with the original cast and wan in the drivers seat the only negative i could find was some predictability with a few minor plot points but i think that is to be expected with a royal succession story i am not losing any sleep over it i cant wait to see it again really good movie,fantasy
dc scores again with a solid adaptation of story was almost spot on character development and interactions were excellent wow the special effects rocked and showed what dc is capable of with the right direction and made me pause many time just in auh of under water effects like hair and clothes movement loved the movie and would not have changed a thing big thumbs up sorli,fantasy

i am right now in the cinema watching the movie and am on my phoneit actually started well but it got lamer and lamer and i just couldnt keep my attentionit seems rhe movie makers have one goal show how much cgi they can put in its somehow annoying theyll start a fight out of nowhere and its just too muchalso the lack of creativity is apparent for example the star wars like costumes the evil dude outfit that looks like antman meet predator and the scene where they slide on dirt cough cough prince of persiabut nothing is more annoying in the whole film like the explosions tgat take place every time characters are talking i mean i literally screamed come on at the screenoverall the movie started well but just went downhill in my opinion the acting is bad and the cgi get on your nerves after awhile the only positive thing is that now am inspired to read more about atlantis sea creatures and human bad affect on marine life,fantasy
felt like the wrong cast was played for just about every single role not only that it was actually putting us to sleep it was so boring,fantasy
the movie has routine story but its is worth watching prosaction sequencescgi scenesunderwater scenesconssongs when not neededloose scriptplease dont judge expect and compare this to other dc movies like ww and mos,fantasy
just finished watching it this movie is a blast i had a great time watching this film the box office money will sure be racking up with this movie btw dont lost hope in this film because of the rt score or what other people are saying about it there should be no reason why this movies score is 70  or lower it should be around 80 at least this is the best movie after the mess of justice league i do admit there was a lot of things going on so much story stuffed in one film and some of the dialogue didnt fit but either way it was a pretty good movie james wan is a winner so with that being said watch the movie for yourself youre in for a treat,fantasy
let me first say this the cinematography and the lightning are great many thanks to the director and the cinematopgrapher who created an interesting fantasy world for the audience butwere they trying to make a movie or a 4d game mmm because i didnt quit catch anything at all that has logical meaning or sense of realitythe cgi was so weak if we are talking cinema i dont think that the cgi crew have ever been to a cinema school and studied how to mix fiction with logic and make real fantasy lively one you are gonna imagine the green screen behind them you are gonna feel you are standing between 4 green walls with the actors put that away from your mind you get a beautiful pictureacting and who to blame the director of course the guy has a good cast and still he cant get them to perform well momoa cant even figure out his characters dimensions to get involved so you find him changing depending on the situation a new character each scene not a character to follow is he a leader to follow the story should tell you story mmmstory and the corruption of screen play writing in dc story line is broken there isnt any actually its just a typical cliche kind of story that you can always predict its events or atleast never get surprised with any of it because you have seen it 1000 of times beforeso the plot is weak and everything you already know fron the beginning and you are waiting for it to either happen or not nothing new will appear after the first 15 mins and guess what the infamous black mantis the cool guy from the trailer could have been so easily kicked out from the movie and you wouldnt even care him and all his scenes but the director wanted to strech the movievideo editing is so bad disturbing and not meaningful repeating some things twice as if theyre legendary or something you feel the editing and thats why it is so badcomedy and hell those jokes were not funny i liked the comedic ironies and actions that occured that were related to the story but why throw jokes what grown up superhero does this not even spidermanso origin story is full of jokes and i will always remember that its taking some of black panther and some of thor ragnarok and thats a stupid mixoh yeah and one last think people of atlantis kneel for who ever is king which should be the big joke but it wasnt lolthe movie has a beautiful image not logical sometimes its a perfect popcornmovie and perfect for dc fans,fantasy
based on the dc comics character of the same name is the big dc blockbuster that finally opened in cinemas today in india directed by james wan best known for helming the spooky conjuring series now delves into the superhero mold and delivers a visual spectacle wan however suffers partially on the account of an overstuffed screenplay that is patchy and overlong synopsis arthur curry jason momoa in a winning performance the heir to the underwater kingdom of atlantis must step forward to lead his people against his halfbrother orm patrick wilson who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world who appeared in last years disappointing justice league gets his solo origin story here and the superhero is an instantly likable one and momoa gets into the skin of the superhero and delivers a fun turn that leads to much success momoa not only looks the part but brings a fabulous heroism to the part which was essential hereanother ace of are its visuals this biggie looks like a dream the world created underwater is dreamy and will leave your eyes mesmerized the graphics are of topgrade and is easily the best looking dc film yet and the actionsequences though way too many are proficiently picturised and executed some of the stunts are wow id like to point the one sequence that takes place in italy in the films latter half its stupendoushowever despite magnificent visuals and momoa nailing the titular role suffers due to an overstuffed screenplay david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick  will bealls screenplay brings much action and a fastmoving narrative but has no soul sure wasnt going to be an experience full of pathos and soul but here there is none of it not even a slight bit of it the film keeps moving forward not giving enough time to its characters to make them connect with the viewers and there is just too much action here i mean the action does leave a big impact but there is an overdose of it here quite frankly it appears as if the writers ran of out ideas in the middle and kept writing action setpieces until they found another aspect to continue upon and there is barely any humor here which is surprising since momoa seems to be good at being funny the writing couldve been better for surejames wans direction is topnotch as mentioned earlier is a visual delight and the director gives the film the look it deserves this is a grand film and looks every bit of it don burgesss cinematography is fantastic the lensman has captured the film beautifully kirk morris editing is decent but couldve been crisper feels a little too long at a 143minutes some trimming of at least 20minutes was required art  costume design are perfect rupert gregsonwilliamss score is superbarring momoa boasts an impressive host of actors but the ones who stand out are patrick wilson impressive as the villain  willem dafoe as nuidis vulko efficient in a strong supporting role amber heard as mera nicole kidman as atlanna dolph lundgren as nereus  temuera morrison as thomas curry are adequateon the whole is definitely fun but it doesnt utilize its potential to the fullest a decent watch,fantasy

one word  epic  probably one of the greatest super hero films of all time excellent plot superb special effects especially the city  great love story back story  really enjoyed this film  forget the dark dc  this film has it all,fantasy
i do not commonly give out even 9s and so far have given a half dozen or so movies ever made as a 10 but you know this really was in contention for a 10 i have to be honest i really didnt think an movie was going to be that great when it was announced they did such a bad job with both superman and batman and considering how much better i considered those characters to be i didnt see they could do much with i was very very wrongthis is genuinely excellent it is a superhero movie and of course therefore hits all the same sort of high points of any superhero movie but just does it all brilliantly they gave himself a really fun and interesting character they had an excellent story with really well written characters and a lot of laughs along the way too the story is a real spectacle on top of that so really what more could you possibly ask forif you want a good action adventure then this is a top class example of it,fantasy
words can not even appropriately express how i feel about this im not giving this a 10 cause perfection is practically unattainable blah blah blah see for yourself youd probably give it an 11,fantasy

it looks as though the dceu has some hope between the success wonder woman had and now there is some light at the end of the tunnel after all the dceu now has room to restructure their semi folly flicksruns via the justice league  suicide squad or does it the reason why i say this is that it looks as though the dceu movieverse does better with their standalone character driven films than it does when theyre relayed as a team perhaps it was a matter of bad timing i humbly think they should have introduced their primary standalone character films first before rushing in team collaborated feature films trying to catch up with marvel seemed to have been the plan the folly there was marvel has been good at their movieverse craft for quite some time now dc should have just paced themselves one character at a timebut enough of the loom and gloom this was supposed to be a positive review and thus it shall be to be frank i didnt expect the film to be as good as it was and admittedly had my doubts and reservations dont get me wrong i thought it was going to be fun but fun in a goofy way not that i was expecting the whole thing to be goofy just more so than not but to my surprise there was less goofiness and more straight up fun not only that but there were dark yet mystical elements to the film as well supplemented with a dash of wittiness and character albeit the style that was presented in this film wasnt over the top nor was it lowly either but in my humble opinion done just right from a comic book world perspective from the telling tale of arthur curry to the general creation and lore of the world around him i really didnt want it to end and yearned for more and it made me feel like that slightly more so than when i watched wonder woman as much as i also greatly appreciated that filmnow its no secret that to portray atlantis properly there would have to be some heavy cgi and i will say it was done just right  considering current cgi technologies plus budget allowance the architecture presented both modern atlantis and old sectors as well to describe the way it was done would be harder said than seen the rich textures and lush colors at so many turns let alone the style of structures utilized created a mythical magic about atlantis unlike seen before part of which included atlantean technological advancements of course i did see some areas that i thought needed more attention to detail but my overall admiration of what was presented far outweighed my nitpickiness the only real way to describe what atlantis is like in this movie is to go see it yourselfthe actors did an admirable job as someone who reads comics i had a tough time seeing jason momoa as arthur curry lets face it arthur from the comics and arthur in this film look very different and although ive been a fan of jason momoas roles in both stargate atlantis no pun intended and game of thrones  i just couldnt visualize jason hitting the mark as and to my surprise he did just that especially as a dceu extension of the character he did a fantastic job just as arthur jason delivered a bold conflicted and sometimes misunderstood whilst showing us a prideful not easy to uncover loving side as wellthe supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do  quite the impressive cast it was patrick wilson as ocean master nicole kidman as atlanna willem dafoe as nuidis vulko amber heard as mera and even dolph lungren as king nereus and more sometimes its not the actors alone who make or break a film no matter who the actoractress is oftentimes its the synergy of how the characters coalesce to one another thats an integral part of the process hence is why i reiterate this supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do and delivered a successful filmi must admit when i see non comic book readers critique a comic book film it makes me cringe not always but a fair amount of times which is why in my humble opinion when seeing a superhero film dont rely on such critics too much and sometimes this includes comic book reader critics too go in with an open mind and judge for yourself the world thats being presented to you a comic book movieverse is one of those rare exceptions where relying on your own critiquing is a much better way of validating your liking or disliking of any one of these films over other critics themselvesas for me i really relished this film it had all the elements required to portray and the world around him from the storytelling and the lore presented to the characters themselves and the laid out visuals go see it and lean on your own genuine open minded critiquing when you do see it,fantasy
empty film empty story they used to much comic aspects all the characters lack background its like a film with no connection everything is floating around the real story of they could had developed it as a trilogy and focus more it feels like a 6 month project with a huge budget all what they aimed was money,fantasy
i usually go to see a movie with very low expectationsi do not watch the trailers nor read other reviews because i want to be surprised blown up by the moviedid not happened nope this movie could not meet my very low expectations it was sofull of cliches boringgave it 3 stars because of the effort,fantasy
i cannot believe people are saying this is better than the nolans batman no it isntthe visuals are stunning that is true the lead is decent though they dont know whether to make him wisecracking or serious and of course the film falls down the middlebut the script is awful the jokes the cliches are horrific the end battle is cgi genius except it is confused and ridiculousbut its biggest problem is it is too long about two and a half hours too long,fantasy
i like dc more than marvel but very disappointing movie very lame its bad that dc is flowing marvel i really dont understand how the box office turned out this way maybe not my typeamovie veryyy excited for joker movie seems dope,fantasy
unfitting music silly characters and events that do not flow whatsoever i felt like i was watching a power rangers movie for tweens that offered nothing original or entertaining bored out of my mind nicole kidman was the best part of it which i have never said before,fantasy
bad story cheezy dialog bad acting cant believe the great reviews this is getting should have animated it and used it for a saturday morning cartoon if i hadnt been at the theater with someone would have walked out,fantasy
the makers should have handed out a leaflet with all the backstories for us to read it would have saved at least 30 minutes of tedious exposition about whose brother got in a fight with which kingdom it never seemed to end exposition interrupted by an explosion a fight another exposition etceteragreat special effects though,fantasy
i really hoped that james wan would bring something new into this franchise but no the film is extremely formulaic lacks character development and even the dialogues are cringe worthy the jokes fell flat i was hoping until the climax that something would happen that would be a surprise but james wan gives nothing of that sort in this movie the visuals have been wasted an emotional character driven story could have been told in the end we get a shallow and boring film that relies too much on action sequences rather than its characters to carry the story forward nevertheless it is an improvement over other dc films,fantasy
will i watch it again yes its not gonna win a best picture but it was very entertainingthere were times i was the edge of my seatwatched the movie in a curved big screen digital cinema extremely immersive,fantasy
learning from bvs justice league and ww as the beginning i didnt expect any great outcome from this movie but eventually i gave it a try by watching it on the first day and booomm it was greati love the plot and we can clearly see another side of arthur which shown in details and theres a true emotion were put there to give a story for his backgroundi think the cgi felt a bit stiff while on aquatic scene but i think its quite comprehensible thinking how the details and long duration are brought out togetheroverall i think this is one of the most worthy dcu movie since bvs,fantasy
just got back from a preview screeningsolid 910 in terms of action movies  great action movie with a decent plot and actual character development definitely must see on the big screenprobably my favorite of all dceu films a nice new but familiar hero moviecgi was well donewell cast i thought everyone fit their roles quite welldecent actingwell put together filmaction sequences were great over the top evenplot was mostly well done not really any loose ends predictablea few minor slow points but otherwise constant actioncinematography was great for the underwater worldsvillains were a mixed bag but at least some decently developed not 1dimensional evil guyssound track was really different and unusal i thought it was greatstuck mostly to canon comics which is great but adding in new twists id say this is one of the more faithful comic movie adaptionsno sjw stuff other than changing the race of the main character it is never mentioned and it makes zero difference to the character or movie they just have nicely written characters no one is over powered everyone has their pros and cons except who has no pros just cons p nice comedic bits but not too much just rightgreat finale,fantasy
i started typing in google is and it autofilled the worst movie ever which is exactly what i expected,fantasy
a zerostar script one star added for competent cgiand the worldwide public has to date paid a billion to see it was a series of lines and stagings from every movie youve ever seen and not in a good way every scene was predictable it doesnt take long for that realization to set in wait didnt we see that scene in dr doolittle with hints of flipper and that scene was that casablanca and were those creatures the flying monkeys from wizard of oz no couldve fooled mewant a poignant fatherson pirate presentation of a manly heirloom ugly and savage pirates not johnny depp right in the middle of a violent boarding heres your filmwant to lurch from a strange undersea world to the sahara and then to a quaint italian village  all in five minutes  where the lovers discover amore and pulls a quick superman heroic where you think youve somehow landed in the adventures of tintin heres your filmlike your lovers to embrace and neck right in the middle of the major battle scene complete with gals leg halfway up the thigh of the hero heres your filmand if you havent seen on golden pond in awhile or taken in the fourth station of the cross or heard he has risen since easter heres your filmbonnie and clyde escaping under a hail of billets checkshakespearean family strife drawing from merchant of venice possibly hamlet traces of romeo and juliet a reverse macbeth and heavy on the tempest checka terribly wooden script with no susatained suspense checkevery outcome of every scene obvious checkwith this amount of money in the project there is no excuse,fantasy
apparently 1 or 10 are the only two grades most people use when it comes to superhero movies it seems like dc fans are giving 1 to all marvel movies and marvel fans are giving 1 to all dcthis movie is not 10 and its not 1 either it is an ok movie to take your kids depending on how old they are they will probably enjoy it in my opinion it is definitely not for adults with at least average intelligence very one dimensional easy to predict lots of things which make no sense boring and forced action and attempt at humour accompanied with bad acting and no chemistry between characters,fantasy
just read the header im going to have to write more to extend my review so it can pass i could not wait for the credits to come,fantasy
james wan has brought to life in spectacular fashion with effects only rivalled by avatar and plot that absolutley suits the character the film is undoubtedly the dceus new direction with an overwhelming message sent and the astounding black manta portrayal this movie is 100 one to watch,fantasy
just saw as much as i love jason mamoa this movie was boring 212 hours and they could have easily cut an hour the entire plot is i have to fight my brother to save the planet from going to war with a couple of little minor side tangents its probably much more geared toward men who enjoy a good battle and special effects because there was plenty of that not enough meat in the plot for me and the whole thing just seemed to drag i literally wanted to walk out but kept hoping the ending would be worth it the ending would have been much more worth it if it happened about an hour earlier good one for dvd but i dont recommend paying to see it in theaters,fantasy
there is a giant octopus playing drums under water do i need to say more,fantasy
ever since dc revived there cinematic universe all of the movies so far were okwith the exception of wonder woman 2017 my favorite of them all 30 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave to many effects not a good story line and really hard to follow now i know why dc will never be 1 save this one for home video,fantasy
when i scroll through all the raving reviews im truly baffled is not the worst film and considering the other films in the dc universe you could build a solid argument for it however this film was not even remotely good going in i had bare minimum expectations but i was hoping to be surprised but going out i strongly wished for a refund and im not even the one who paid for my ticketin terms of the barebones of the film it felt confused obviously it was a comedy but when it came to the levels of comedic value it gave off it was never consistent the dessert scene made me gag with the quirky music in the background and did not fit well with the vibe the rest of the film gave,fantasy
like many of the people who have said before this genre a type of movies is getting way out of hand enough is enough if you guys are running out of ideas if you guys are putting females in male roles to get people to come and watch this of crap then its time to scale back these types of movies start producing movie people wanna watch not just the same type of people over and over and over again this genre is totally wiped out creativity in the movie industry wanna make money make a superhero movie youll make lots of money every one who loves comic book heroes go see it well im sorry but youre losing a lot of real fans love watching movies we live in an era where young people believe the comic books fine literature or classical literature this is a total joke this movie just characterizes how low we have gotten and why we fail to understand what movies really are,fantasy
i have never written a review but i had to let others know if you want to go and just be entertained that is all it is i was so excited to see it and i am a huge fan of but sadly i was dissappointed weak story and no development yes stunning cgi but they spent millions fantasic actors and cast but it lacked something if i wasnt with my family i would have walked out during my many trips to the concession stand for refillsso ignore the high ratings its not worth it wait and see it on bluray since dc has not realized the formula for great story telling like marvel i will wait for any other films to be released for homeviewing except wonder woman follow ups seriously dc how can you expect moviegoers to support your overblown budgets when you cannot deliver a deceit movie to watchoh well,fantasy
if you absolutely lovetransformers 4  5indiana jones kingdom of the crystal skullstar wars the phanthom menacejustice leaguethen you might actually like this,fantasy
if you thought this movie was gonna be a good superhero movie turn around and put your head in a trash can because it will look and sound the same possibly the worst superhero movie ever,fantasy
the positive is the action and effects negatives is the story and acting in general everything came across as lane,fantasy
ive been getting a little bored with the superhero movies of late but was different enough to feel fresh the visuals were stunning it got a little bit carried away with itself in places and it had its fair share of cheesy moments but overall an enjoyable film,fantasy
packed to the gills with over the top cartoony action clever nods to other pop works and hilarious comedy this warner bros motion picture directed by james wan was the first dc live action movie in a long time to go with a lighter tone set in their extended universe this fish out of water heros journey story of a humanoid merman arthur curry jason momoa being reintroduce to his cultures origins in order to reclaim his birthright before his halfbrother ocean master patrick wilson takes the throne  seek revenge on the surface world was entertaining without spoiling the movie too much brooding over serious and somber doesnt fit at all they made the right decision of tone even if the actors edgy badass presence doesnt fit well with the wholesome colorful silver age look nevertheless i did like momoas surf bro style of acting i just wish the movie didnt make arthur seem so much of airhead after all hes supposed to be a wise king that care for his kingdom in this movie he rarely thinks or try to embrace with his people all he wants to gain the peoples trust is to find a silly lost mcguffin while the treasure hunting subplot is fun its still a bit odd that his people who barely knows anything about him would make curry their king after he kill hundreds of them just because he now holds a legendary trident as for the other leader the one they knew he got off the hook a little too easy as well he done far worse regardless who is the true leader this senseless war resulted in large number of deaths  casualties which this movie sadly highly glazed over none of the royals felt bad about how many atlanteans were murdered a little comeuppance or selfless sacrifice would had been justified for both rulers maybe arthur losing an arm to save them or ocean master accidently drowning by his own hands would made the film a little more satisfied plus it would add more stakes surprised twist or innovative concept in a movies plot that didnt take that much risk as of right now the main plot is kinda thin bland and generic its not adding much of anything new in truth i thought the film would had been a little bit better if they stay away from the surface world as much as possible why very little of the history of the surface world make sense within the story they trying to tell logically its really hard to believe that the justice league wouldnt had interfered after the tsunamis even if they were busy the film did the right decision by not hanging up too much from the previous movie the film is already confusing enough with people not believing atlantis exist despite that there has two alien invasions an goddess running around and a enchantress attack nevertheless there were a lot of loose ends the heros superpowers  physical imperfections are kinda inconsistent  poorly define this lend to a lot of confusement on what things could harms curry a good example of this is the desert scene isnt the lack to expose water one of currys weaknesses to add onto that how does he even have tattoos if he has strong healing ability better yet does his powers give him a new orangeandgreen suit things like that dont add up even the bizarre reunion with family members recognize each other instantly despite one of them being a kid the last time was a bit offed regardless of the story the visuals were beautiful even if they look fake and highly disproportionate nothing seem like it was physically or scientifically there they really did overused the computer effects need more practical effects sets cgi was overwhelming regardless i did like how the movie look it was bright  colorful rather than the desaturated color palette and pitch black darkness as for the dialogue it was a mixed bag i kinda dig the villains eco terrorism reasons to fight i wish the flick explore more of that sadly a lot of the corny exposition given throughout the movie is highly repetitive the film is full of people reminding each other of things they should at the very least know already like the rules of within their society then there are things that are never explained like what happen to the previous king in spite of that i really dont mind most of the casting some of the performers playing older parental figures despite being nearly the same age with their costars whom are acting as their adult children was fine with me i found nicole kidman  temuera morrison working great as the movies emotional heart piece as for amber heard i found mera to enjoyable to watch despite the controversies surrounding the actresss personal life i also didnt mind wilson being here even if its a bit jarring to see him in yet another dc movie after 2008s watchmen  2015s batman v superman he was fine as for yahya abdulmateen ii he was good as black manta hopefully he has a bigger role next time rounding out the cast are julie andrews willem dafoe and dolph lundgren they were scene stealers trying not to rock the boat the only acting that i didnt like were the thespians playing the younger version of arthur they had really wooden delivery overall while this movie did swam up from the depths of the dc universe and into theaters ending with a mediocrity end credit stinger nevertheless im willing to dip into uncharted waters and say this movie is whale of a time worth watching even if its story is just a small drop in the ocean that didnt sail smoothly in the end its still worth diving into my man at least once or twice,fantasy
worse than your average super hero moviemovie was trash,fantasy
a very typical sci fi film that has a particular feature that it appears to have no story at all the movie runs for 2 hrs and 22 minutes of which 2 hours comprise of never ending action scenes between ugly and unbelievable sea creatures watching this movie is an absolute wastage of time and money,fantasy
predictable dull poor special effects silly meaningless scenes poor actinga lot of wide feet posturing and billowing deep voices but it does not deliver packing a slap with a wet fish this one opens being silly and gets more sillyso i took it at face value and tongue in cheek movie for the almost cartoon superherobut even that was too much for this the special effects were so poor i tasked myself with finding the worst ones who morphed the faces onto the cartoons did well but it was so ott that you cannot take it seriouslybright lightinglights take your eyes away from the scenes but it is so poor i swear willem dafoe is laughing while he says his linesthe narrator made me laugh  how silly and far fetched  too far fetched for people maybe in a cartoonthe storyline was created adhoc during the movie seemingly to fit in and add something to this posit really is steaming you can taste it the smell is that badit is boring and unintentionally funny its that badmy daughters school play had lines delivered better than this  seriouslyyou may find something to like about this movie i couldntthe sequel will be avoided unless i have no arms legs and cannot control my mouth or communicate at all this is so bad it should get its own category,fantasy
what the hell dont waste your time half way through it becomes national treasure then back to over the top storm troopers with huge cannons looks like a low budget movie so tacky so fake so boring on par with cloud atlas,fantasy
very very disappointed everytime i have to watch the animated film to regain my consciousness i literally cried so far every movie by dc sucks apart from batman trilogy chirstian bale,fantasy
just like many of the bad reviews here i dont get why this movie received a high rating maybe i missed something but this movie was dumb cheesy and silly from piranha men to jurassic park to a dessert with nice new clothes on to an octopus beating drums i just dont know what im missing here i wish monma never agreed with corny jokes and just awkward moments i saw this movie for free and wasted 2 hours and some changed this movie is truly all over the map and as you continue to watch it feels like the director is hearing you down with a bag of organges very very very slow and methodical with out any reason whyblavk mantas voice was not over exaggerated like batman but was more annoyingjust like justice league there was no attempt to allow the movie to build a suspense as you know what was coming music was bad as it went from one end to the other in secondsthe entire story just straight suck wait until payperview or on regular tv,fantasy
dont give me wrong i love superheroes and jason momoa but the underwater cgi is just bad and those weird sea creatures not good go see mary poppins returns instead its much better,fantasy
what the hell is it with all these 10 out of 10 reveiws before i saw it everywhere i looked all i saw was incredible reveiws and ungodly hype for this movie it was brilliant they said better than anything the mcu had to offer in 9 years were they watching a different moviethe movie i watched was sickeningly corny terribly scripted punctured full of plot holes had some downright useless characters had the weakest story ive seen in a film for years and was plauged with awful actingif i wasnt to give this movie a 1 out of 10 it is because patrick wilson was a great villain the visuals were stunning and just less than half of the action scenes were really well donedissappointed,fantasy
only for 10 year olds do not watch this movie only for 10 year olds do not watch this movie,fantasy
if you go to the movies for awesome visuals but dont care too much for good storytelling then perhaps is for youhere isnt quite the joke of a character he was in the late 90s and early aughts but he doesnt fare much better hes certainly not the same caliber of character he was in justice league and that alone should say a lotlowering the bar simply because it is a comic book movie doesnt sit well with me so if this is more indicitive of what zack snyder wants to produce then the dceu is in more trouble than we ever realized,fantasy
you that called movie very bad cgi and scenariowhywe have 2018,fantasy
i would have loved this movie if the execution was right but it was not the transition between scenes is not seamless most of the time the order and pacing of events is so bad you cannot have an action scene that has some romancesilent moments midway through i understand that some movies do that but the combination is done right this movie does not do that right,fantasy
simply perfect with just one wordthe best movie dc universe has ever been shotfunny at all according to mebetter than bvsbut i didnt watched it all,fantasy
i had high hopes for this movie but dc came up short in my opinion it could have been better than what it was actually walked out on the movie little more than half way through just couldnt take it anymore to me it was mostly the script everyone will have different views of the movie wonder woman is still the best dc movie so far,fantasy
visuals aside which admittedly are pretty fing outrageous acting character development and story are laughable some enormously cringeworthy attempts at campy humor with circus like odd music just weird ,fantasy
after the release of justice league i wasnt optimistic about anything in the dc extended universe not named wonder woman i thought was just going to be terrible and unnecessary in a universe that seemed to be in disarray i was kind of warming up to it with the new trailers released and the fact that a competent filmmaker in james wan i think this is an fairly entertaining entry in the dc universe and definitely the second best film after wonder womanthe film follows the story of arthur curry who is an heir to an underwater kingdom that his half brother is trying to take control of the film goes into the details of currys past and shows how eventually became the hero he is today in this film must find a powerful trident and stop a war that threatens his people and all of earth the film stars jason momoa amber heard nicole kidman and patrick wilsonwan reunites with a reliable name in wilson who plays ocean master both him and black manta feel like generic villains as is the case with a lot of superhero films its also tough to establish a villain with the general unfamiliarity with the comics for the general masses you can tell the film has a big budget as it is exquisite in its underworld fantastical elements and all the action and effects that go along with itthe film isnt anything groundbreaking when it comes to superhero films and its quite cheesy in dialogue and comedic nature it still works for the most part and is a refreshing change in light tone and color in this universe its not exactly a huge endorsement as to why the dceu should continue to exist but it shows that under the right guidance it can work better than most previously anticipated710,fantasy
the scene where they were walking on the dunes in the saharathey have this silly discourse that just doesnt fit the rest of the movies tone there were other lighthearted moments i can let go in context of the scene like the barselfie scene the forgot the plan after the kiss scene the look on the goats face after they jumped from plane and the not memorizing the message they got under the dunes before she destroyed item but that scene and conversation on top the dunes made me drop my score at least 1 point for losing continuity,fantasy
this reminds me of avatar this movie is beautiful to look at but its nowhere near as good as all the hype these people are creating i dont know who these people that gives this movie 1010 sycophantically or if they seen any movie ever  but this movie is not a 10 its really sad that today all movie makers have to do is show some bright colorful lights on the screen and people will give it instant 1010 here is my honest points about this movie dont worry pretty lights dont distract me good enough acting surprisingly good cinematography good directing fight scenes look bit too choreographed story is nothing new  its a rip off from several movies cgi everywhere but at least this time its understandable why i dont know if it was the theater i watched this but the music was bit too loud compared to the dialogueas far as dceu movies goes this is slightly below wonder woman for me i do agree this is a step towards the right direction for dceu  but this is not exactly the right direction,fantasy
wowdefinitely one of d best dceu movie is just insane ride of visual art badass actiondecent plot great performances most importantly great direction james ma man wan,fantasy
a origin story done right and an insane world building movie,fantasy
 is a flawed movie but in its essence made by the hands of james wan the movie worksthere are a few flashbacks scenes that feels out of a place but overall in some scenes i felt i was watching a well choreographed and dull spectacle with a powerful messagethe movie sticks with an unconventional hero that make us laugh all the time and it makes its best with its villainsthe ending is quick and its not boringi still like the marvel movies but surprised me by its owl fuel keeping the story on tracksits definitely the most entertaining movie of the year but be warnedavoid marvel comparissons because thats ridiculoushave a good movie,fantasy
 is the best of the dc movies after christopher nolan has left us with amazing the dark knight series dc has always tried to copy marvel and this fight will always continue between dc  marvel fans that who is the best among two talking about this movie it is a visual treat to the audiences in 3d specially recommended as one starts feeling itself to be a part of sea i would say everyone should watch it may that be a marvel fan or dc fan it worthy watching,fantasy
great intro and finish but the whole experienced got diminished thanks to the sound in the cinema swedish premiere cinema called rigoletto the runtime was ok i felt frustration the moment i saw the 1530 minutes being copied by marvel universe the silliness isnt dc worthy in my opinion they should stick with the justice league aura that was one of the best superhero movies of all time alot thanks to the huge buildup which this flick didnt accomplish at all sadlybut to end with a good note they are copying something good from marvel wait and see ,fantasy
after a terrible start to the dceu it finally looks like dc is heading towards the right direction the movie is very to the point getting you excited in the first 20 minutes a few times the plot got a little messy but it quickly got back on track the music score was phenomenal besides two pop songs that were awkwardly place in the movie the main characters were all interesting and great action scenes the best being the battle between and black manta overall this movie was very entertaining no one can say that this movie was boring you definitely getting your money worth,fantasy
nice movie with a lot funny thing the duration of the movie i think too long but afterall not bad,fantasy
this is a perfect superhero movie constant action filled suspense with a great classic superhero story great cgi and great characters almost perfect,fantasy
i didnt have much expectations for this movie tbh after the failure of justice league but after watching this movie last thursday it completely blew my mind with its overwhelming visuals superb soundtracks and great storyline this is by far the best superhero origin movie for year 2018 well if you exclude spiderman into the spiderverse james wan really done a great job in bringing this character to life and restore the dceu,fantasy
atlantis has always had a king now it needs something more,fantasy
typical hero journey where the hero must face hardships and go through a trial to achieve the one thing he doesnt wantto become king rightnot exactly and it isnt quite so simple dont worry i dont drop spoilersi mean yes were definitely following the hero journey story line because its a superhero movie but there isnt much typical about this movie much like there isnt anything typical about jason momoa is filled with comedy and drama love exceptional action and horror that throws some fantastic jumpscare at its audience the backstory is well done and touching the comedy is timed perfectly in my opinion and quite hilarious were faced with more than one bad guy but also shown consequences of our actions and by our i mean we the audience as well as the charactersweve already seen momoa in this role in justice league but this film this movie expands on that and he is outstanding and was meant to play arthur curry of that i have no doubt kinda like ryan reynolds is deadpool nicole kidman as atlanna kicks ass amber heard as mera gives a great performance and willem dafoewhat can i say the man playing vulko has been in both marvel and dc movies and his acting is stellar as always patrick wilson gives a fabulous performance as the entitled king orm and yahya abdulmateen ii shows us a glimpse of mantas humanity albeit brief and what one will do to exact revenge james wan insidious furious 7 director gives us visualsholy sht the visualsthat are stunningly beautiful and storytelling that is spot on and retains the momentum from jenkins wonder woman keeping the dcus heart beating strongi dont know about you but i think dc has finally figured out how to make movies i will definitely be watching this again and buying iti dig it,fantasy
good entertainerif u wanna enjoy it go for the effects and action  dceu keeps hope with further  like it after all ,fantasy
great movie doesnt take self too seriously was never boring good pacing great acting stunning visuals just watch it,fantasy
its only worth it if you watch it in 3d and in the dolby sound systems as all the atlantis scenes under water are seeming real in the 3d,fantasy
the best of this current series of dc movies visually incredible epic set pieces and tonnes of potential for more out of this characters universe james wans direction and the cinematography is brilliant during the fight scenes and the spectacle of the large battles the final act of the film is mindblowingly epic with sea creatures fighting alongside armies etc the performances are good from everyone momoa has managed to make cool amber heard and willem dafoe are spot on as mera and vulko and lastly we get two of the dc universes coolest cinematic villains with ocean master and black manta the latter having one of the best action sequences in the movie and costume wise everyone is straight out the pages of the comics few minor issues the humour just isnt funny at all some of the dialogue is awkward and not well delivered also some of the licensed music used is dreadful the score is good though this is proof if dc arent done with their universe and is one of the best comic book movies this year ,fantasy
look im not a die hard fan of any super hero comic books i just enjoy movies for what it is if i walk out of every cinema after watching movies and i know in myself that i definitely enjoyed it then ill give those movies a 1010 no matter what other criticspeople says because i dont rely on opinions of others when it comes to having personal enjoyment and for me though ive decided to watch this moivie without knowing anything about him im really surprised at how fast he became one of my favorite super heroes along side iron man captain america superman and wonder woman,fantasy
it feels like the longest and worse action adventure game youll playi was watching it and just thinking to myself how any god of the war games would entertain me so much more than this awful filmim sorry but its simply below mediocre it is like 54 imdb worth,fantasy
it was just awesome im speechless amazing visual effects and a great story from the new 52,fantasy
its a very very very boring movieand very long,fantasy
 is a bad movie lets get that straight from the costuming to the score except sigur ros i love me some sigur ros to the plot to the acting its all pretty awful jason momoa shows no emotion throughout the entire film i would however highly recommend to everyone that they see as soon as possible it is unintentionally comedic genius from literally murdering a hiding cowering henchmen to challenging the bbeg to a fair fight in front of a live audience then proceeding to get his  kicked and run away from the duel after cheating and tagteaming the villain before he had the chance to win ends up feeling more like a villain himself than a hero it doesnt help of course that the villains main motivation to attack the human world is that they attacked him first the villains not even a villain also this movie is oddly fascist like the whole time the script makes sure that you know that only the blood elite have the ability to rule and thats not challenged by that stays the status quo the entire movie not to mention the incredible amount of plot holes and inconsistencies and omg the costumes seriously if you are into sobaditsgood films give this one a watch you wont be disappointed,fantasy
im being stingy with the 3 stars but i needed to balance out the 1010s that the marketing agents gave it i like jason mamoa but he is a very wooden actor and not a good choice as lead story is generic predictable and full of the usual cliches only positive was the effects which were very impressive but even that could not keep my lids open  i dozed off near the end i suggest waiting for it on netflix and only watch as a last resort,fantasy
movie was very cheesy and i felt like i was watching a power rangers film with the unrealistic costumes they tried to throw so many things together in one movie that it did not fit at all,fantasy
fun vibrant corny comic book movie its a visual extravaganza,fantasy
wow this movie blew me away not a moment i could breath just constant action and amazing sfx with good acting and very believable worldi grew up on comics and was never an easy character or world and thus was never really popular or interesting on his own usually coming to life when in a role with another character or big storybut somehow they managed to pull of something amazing that actually made me really see the character and world in a way i had never thoughti can absolutely see how critics and those that are so into dissecting and criticizing movies and forgetting that its movie goers who matter and if they want escapism and fun then who cares what your checklists and technicalities arethe visuals are awe dropping and i did not even see it in imax they did an amazing job in creating the whole ocean world and easily the best sfx so far in the dc worldthe black manta character was a bit off and i im not sold on him found myself more irritated by him than anything but i think they were trying to must seed him into the future story linesif your put off by the critics ignore them and go and see it apart from the real sticklers you will all love it just sit back and prepare to be awed and go on an emotional roller coasterits so not like a conventional super hero movie and that is great as why have the same things over and over it felt more like a clash of the titans journey with an avatar world of escapism mixed in,fantasy
i like marvel movies but after watching one word masterpeacethis is marvelous  wow unbelievable experiences in history of world cinema i think i watch first time on big screen in my life a magical craziness and i nothing word of thismovies watching feel like action adventure drama love horror monstorversafter many years this type of movie released in the world3d is amazingmovies each single frame is a master peace i give a rating is 8510movie watch again and again for movies visuals and json momoa strong performance,fantasy
wow just wow just came back from this movie and still have to digest how awesome it was visually this might be the most impressive movie i have seen storywise it is maybe a tad bit clich but luckily it doesnt take itself overly serious and jason momoa has a lot of fun playing and gives him a lot of heart as hero and humanpatrick wilson did a decent job but wasnt necessarily the best villain ever his costume down the line did not help even though it was kinda true to the comicsbut really this is the kind of movie why cinemas still exist seeing it on your home screen would not do it justice,fantasy
i just watched the movie guys and it was amaaazing  go watch it immediately,fantasy
just like wonder woman a worthy film which dc fans wanted desperately,fantasy
i was speculating on the existence of this movie 15 minutes i found an answer its just because just because the movie is of the dc universe it has to have cgi in it just because the movie is for dc fans it has to have sfxs incoherent plot with conquer the world written all over it just because this is just another movie because a bunch of suits thought it would be fun to milk those atrophied taste buds fans of their moneyshort story watch it just because you do not have anything to do or just because its a movie or just because you just read this review and you are curious just because ,fantasy
just terrible one of the worst films i have seen and when the red eyed bug turned up in italy that was enough for me makes thor ranorak look like a brilliant movie,fantasy
the only thing good was the fun we were making of it the whole time we havent sat through garbage like this in a long timethe writing and directing was the problem with this movie there were some actors in there that im sure are embarrassed to be associated with the movie the middle school dialogue was cringy for almost the entire movie i was so glad when it was finished and wish id left 5 minutes into the movie,fantasy
for the first time dc have a good movie james wan is perfect choice for this film you should watch this movie in imax,fantasy
bad acting weak story ok effectsonly just managed to entertain me,fantasy
cheezy dialog bad acting terrible script and dont get me started on the musicshould have been animated and turned into a saturday morning kids cartoon cant believe all the 10s this movie is getting what are people thinking i would have left early if i hadnt been with someone,fantasy
i must say expected more from this moviewas it just me or were the actors looking overly scriptedand the pace of the movie was slownot to talk about inappropriate places to insert a history pep talk or emotional journeytop notch cinematography costumes and setscgi was amazing toodc could have done better with this guess theres no topping wonder woman,fantasy
one of the best movies from dc truly a magnificent film james wan made his mark in superhero films,fantasy
every scene from this film is not disappointed compare to other dc film before,fantasy
have always been a fan of my favourite idol james wan director of horror movies initially i was sceptical about him directing his first ever superhero movie but guess what it was better than i expected casting jason momoa as is just perfect for the role although i would prefer to have short beard with short hair instead of long beard moustache and long hair hahaha ahemm redhead princess mera amber heard is hot and sexy too while the secondary villain black manta looks exactly from the comic book a very funny big headed black ant to me hahahai tend to agree that 145 minutes is a bit too long for this movie but one thing for sure its full of actions and never boring one of the scenes was filmed in the beautiful island of sicily southern italy which is now on my travel list to visit lastly as usual do stay back for postcredit scene by any dc or marvel films,fantasy
i watched it and wow i have no words to describe the amazing performance from the cast and the visuals were just something else this is a must watch film of 2018 thank you for making this,fantasy
i absolutely loved my expectations were high and i have to say it lived up to it dc is back in the game and this is the best dceu movie its a visual treat and is something that must be experienced by everyone whether a comic book fan or notit is action packed and dives deep into origin james wan did full justice to in this one and he truly has redefined watch this one the biggest possible screen,fantasy
this movie was massively disappointing if youve not seen it and liked batmansupermanwonder woman etc dont press play its just awful youve been warned ,fantasy
seriously this woman cant even smile anymore shes 52 but in this movie she looks like a porcelain doll her face must have been cgi to deathavoid like the plague,fantasy
jason mamoa is good in this hes brings a very thorlike vibe to the role and movie hes the best selling point i can make for thisthe cast in general is solid albeit with some odd choices most noticeably with patrick wilson playing mamoas younger brother wilson is a good actor but maybe midcast in his rolethe biggest problem with this movie is that its 30 minutes too long and the cgi is overwhelming completely overwhelming the cgi is used in lieu of plot writing directing and emotion whatever movie was in the screenplay its completely buried by director james wan with cgiless is more with cgi this ends up feeling like an expensive video game,fantasy
i watched on hbo and fully expected a young adult action movie that was silly but i had hoped would be at least a little entertaining and amusing while suffering a coldwow was i naive and wrong critical reviews are accurate is a real stinkerwritten for and by 710 year olds this is a vacuous 2 hours plus of utterly nonredeeming videogamequality plot and acting just watch the preview and youll get all you needdo not spend money on this one,fantasy
these are boring and over played lets get back to making classics,fantasy
this has to be one of the worst movies ever and it had to come to hbo disney you can have this one for sure this was terrible i hope no ones career gets blacklisted for this garbage every fan of dc marvel who purchased a ticket should sue for emotional damages  i truly thought people were over exaggerating when they said was a horrible movie i found out the hard way and the only good part was at the end with beautiful and gorgeous nicole kidman thats why i gave a 1 point i give nicole kidman a perfect 10 nominations for is a joke false advertising and lying to people who use their hard earn money to watch crap like this should be a federal crime i said what i said,fantasy
better than i was expecting from comics movie it was actually okay movie had his own good moments but it was still typical comic movie like all of the others once you have seen one of them you have seen all of them nothing new same cheesy and silly superhero movie like all of them but at least it had some good messages to us but did we get it thats completely different topicshould you watch it if you dont have nothing else to watch then go for it,fantasy
i expected a lot more from this film but it was truly terrible almost every line was a clich that you just wouldnt expect in 2019 complete lack of depth or excitement  a complete waste of time,fantasy
i dont see why people say this is good i can see it as being considered good compared to something like justice league or batman v superman but thats a pretty low bar to set for a moviethe cgi and backgrounds when theyre on land look horrendous its like they ran out of money from the giant water battles that didnt serve a purpose so they couldnt be bothered to maybe film some of the land scenes i dont know on a location next to an ocean this movie is an hour too long the giant water battles dont serve a purpose other than giant water battles look spiffythe scenes with black manta shouldve been cut and saved for another movie he doesnt add anything and promptly loses to in a fight they couldve at least made the  black manta fight take place underwater instead of land one of the main purposes of his suit is so he can dive to deep distances that hed otherwise not be able to dothe acting in this movie is wooden the woman that played mera cant really act jason momoa seemed like he was just playing a frat boy ocean master was impossible for me to take seriously he reminds me of biblemanthe movie references justice league and steppenwolf in the beginning i was hoping theyve not done that and just pretended justice league never existed since they did mention it what was atlantis up to during those eventsthe rest of the movie was just blah and cgi overload ive always found to be a ridiculous character,fantasy
1010 seriouslythe atlantis guards are power rangers the underwater fighter jets are from star wars the battle with other underwater kingdoms looks like a battle from the lord of the rings some personages are a version of the street sharks even godzila had a resurrection moment do you remember the disneys the sword in the stone even the guy name is arthur did you spotted the dinosaurs at jurasic park i only missed a smeagollike scene with the trident my prrrrecioussssah and a very funny scene is watching trying not to fall and looking very scared from the roof of one house in sicily two stories high  when hed just jumped from a plane thousand meters high with no parachute in the desertbut nicole kidman was beautiful as always,fantasy
i usually just gave stars herethis is my first or second time spending time writing a review i wrote because i cant understand why it is 710  the screenplay is so bad and mediocre i rolled my eyes countless times while watching it jason momoa is charming but literally all dialogues and the plot are flatpredictablegenericlol i bet those who gave this 9 or 10 out of 10 must havent seen real 1010 films such as dark knightthe matrixshawshank redemption,fantasy
there really are very few positive points jason momoa is fun and has a few good tongue in cheek jokes erm no i ran outotherwise its 200 minutes of complete nonsense shoddy overdone cgi 2d characters cliched narrative and predictability amber heard doesnt realise the cameras are rolling whoever said power rangers got it bang oneven if youre a fan of please dont waste your time,fantasy
if you hold your breath long enough and dive real deep underwater you may be lucky enough to suffer enough oxygen deprivation to appreciate this movieits just badthe plot is badthe acting is badthe 25 hour length is damn near criminalid rather swim with the fishes than suffer through this,fantasy
it was so bad on so many levels its hard to accurately describe it it reminded me of watching a kids cartoon as an adult remember when u thought heman and gi joe were the bomb then you tried to watch an episode as an adult totally unbearable thats how i felt watching this monstrosity of bad acting and terrible dialog longest 2 hours i can never get back i love super hero movies but this one really sucked,fantasy
there are certainly enough reasons to love or hate this film the scenes are shot beautifully and the underwater world looks really stunning the cgi is sometimes great but at other times unrealistic for relatively simple scenes nicole kidman diving off into the water the main problem with this movie is the script its too bloated with conceptspower strugglelost sonoriginsenvironmentallove storyartifact huntingfamilyrevengetwo tribeshidden worldantiheronatural disasteri felt like watching troy lord of the rings indiana jones wolverine the gladiator and godzilla all at once not to mention the antagonist looks and talks like a villain from the power rangersdont get me wrong i liked the movie but it was just too much the epic battle in the end was great but felt forced in and didnt add anything to the story with everything thats happening the characters feel shallow shame because theres a lot of potential here,fantasy
very flashy cgi like a bad japanese disco clip nonsensical script and direction nicole kidman hit rock bottom for choosing to star in this motion picture jason momoas acting was no surprise bad as usual i was shocked to see the 7 rating on imdb lots of trolls and paid reviews watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better to do,fantasy
theres nothing good in this movie unless you are hot for momoa its a complete pile of garbage with a stupid story and horrible special effects its a joke but an unfunny one i honestly cannot understand how anyone could rate this any higher than 3 or 4 stats i gave it 2 because im a nice guy,fantasy
total garbage waste of time wish i never even tried to watch this tripe,fantasy
its an allrounder it got everythingi really loved each and every scene in this movie,fantasy
this is by far the worst movie i have seen in years i love these type of movies but the acting and scriptwriting was horrendousi cringed listening to some of the dialogue and just hope the likes of kidman received a massive paycheck to make up for the embarrassment of being associated with this moviewould have given it a 410 but considering how many 1010s have been handed out i felt compelled to compensateit is a pity and a sign of our times that honest opinions are not welcome and everything has to be at an extreme to even countits not just the waste of money for the movie ticket but its 2hrs of my life ill never get back again,fantasy
a cringe fest all the way realistically i wouldve given it a 610 if it wasnt for the unrealistic 1010 reviews out thereit started promising but it got lost a long the way turning into how to train your dragon 2 sahara tomb raider mashupi wanted to like it even tried to justifyexplain some of the moments to my friends but for me this is easily the worst dceu movie,fantasy
man james wan should be ashamed of himself for making this cheesefest of a crap look like a low budget pantomime of a moviei cant believe this was made by the same guy who made conjuringthis movie was bad on so many levels it it complete and utter garbage i really wanted to walk out i should haveeveryone involved in this film looked embarrassed for being in this movie it is so bad its worse than batman and robin this should win a raspberry award i honestly give up on dcit had a thin predictable plot cheesy love scenes like from an indian movie bad acting bad directing bad dialogue even the action scenes were good it was generic and over blown nothing looked genuineand why was up with the bad guy who had a big fly head as a helmet i mean come on this is getting more and more ridiculousit is honestly the biggest pile of poo you will ever witness on screen it deserves 12 raspberry awardsi cant believe they wasted millions on this cow dungplease avoid,fantasy
pretty much any dc movie ive seen has been pretty bad man of steel wasnt bad and wonder woman turned out pretty good so i thought id give this a shot it was such a disaster i actually laughed out loud throughout the movie oh my someone come help these 1010 reviewers some of the cinematography was cool but thats about it,fantasy
flat out this movie is a good visually pleasing movie there is a good amount of action that is well done im not going to tell plot or anything as a comic book fancomic movie fan i put this up there with spiderman homecoming antman dr strange winter soldier still not on infinity war or gotg level none of the comic book movies will surpass that dont listen to critic reviews form your own opinion  likely you wont walk away disappointed if dc wouldve made movies like this out the gate they mightve beat marvel,fantasy
the story seems carelessly thrown together and its lack of substance is disguised by colourful but meaningless fights and special effects the dialogue is so disjointed and over the top a combination of clichs stuck into a sentence there is no connection between the audience and the good guys so there was no enthusiasm for the predictable plot to go their way this movie is ridiculously boring,fantasy
saw it last night a waterlogged tale that made the 2 hour 20 minute run tine seem never ending overdone cgi and you find yourself paying more attention to momoas beard hairs floating in the invisible water than what is happening when you start wondering why they used sequins for the queens gown  is there an underwater michaels instead of something more sealike such as mother of pearl or abalone shell then you know there is something wrong with the film,fantasy
dont get me wrong i thoroughly enjoyed the film all bar one musical aquatic creaturetheres nothing ive seen quite like its daft as they come but in a way that makes you laugh its a stunning showpiece of special effects dialogue akin to films like tango  cash commando and the like but again in a strange way fabulousyoull rarely have a chance to be bored and just when you think it cant become more grandiosely silly this film turns it up to 11 and then moves the speakers nearer your earsleave your brain at the door and revel in this cinematic fun paradefor those that care everybody plays their respective roles pretty well and any hammonds only adds to the overall feel of joythe sound in the imax cinema was thunderous chairs shaking music was equal parts over the top and dramatic again much like the rest of the filmeffects are stunning albeit some of the deageing effects are great but still a little too unreal to completely sell the processsee this on the biggest screen available to you,fantasy
you can get its spoilers in breakdown video but with the power of james wan you can still get extraordinary stories in movie,fantasy
one of the worst movies ever made no comprehensive story and bad acting make for  nothing but i guess some actors were able to pay their rent play it on your tv if you need some senseless background noise,fantasy
positivesdirectingmain castaction scenesmusical scorepacingnegativessome of the humor,fantasy
the graphics and special effects of this movie are absolutely stunning and spectacular but its way way too muchyour eyes are getting bombarded with blinking and flickering images which starting to irritate after a whilethe storyline is very thin and the characters are not very strong and rather predictablei understand there will be a sequel but ill pass,fantasy
this film is awful everything from acting cgi use of music score and other music to plot line feels like 5 different directors tried to tie this junk together it makes no sense the tries do be a drama comedyslapstick sci fi adventure copy of old movies its a mess willem dafoe saves some seens bit otherwisei thought this gonna be bad when the opening credits its a baaaad rip off of marvels introstay away if you dont want youre whole day destroyd and one last thing why are the bad guys black and the good guys from atlantis white think about that,fantasy
thought it might be a great story but is a complete hollywood parody be ashamed producers,fantasy
terrible plot terrible acting terrible cgi complete lack of character development why did they cgi peoples faces for close up shots why did it look so bad everything about this was terrible and felt like watching a low budget straight to tv movie,fantasy
if i hadnt paid for this i would have stopped watching after about an hour better action you get when you go fishing maybe im too old for this s but this was like little mermaid with action wouldnt recommend this to anyone its better to keep tv closed if this was the only thing you could watch,fantasy
hard to decide whats more offensive the endless cgi or the constant reference to the ring of fire aka curry bottom reminiscent of watching my son play xbox games woeful,fantasy
the underwater scenes were beautifully put together but that was really the only upside to the movie aside from the beautiful jason momoa the costumes were tacky the majority of the pivotal points of the movie were very cliche i cringed during many scenes due to the shallowness of the plot and cheesiness of the directingthis is not a good movie,fantasy
cheesy from start to finish absolutely terrible dialog and storytelling the only redeeming quality are the actors,fantasy
dc have learned to make their films bold brash and colourful audiences do not want dark moody superheroes it might work on the dark knight but we want superman to be well super is enjoyable enough nonsense it has similarities with black panther as well as elements of thor and king arthur it injects fun as long as you do not take it all seriouslythe movie begins with a lighthouse keeper tom curry rescuing princess atlanna nicole kidman from the underwater realm of atlantistwo worlds collide they fall in love and have a baby boy arthur curry jason momoa lives with his father in a small fishing coast his mother was snatched back to atlantis when he was a childvulko willem dafoe came from the watery world to mentor and teach arthur about his heritage and combat skills uses his powers to save people in the land worldmera amber heard tells that arthur that he must fulfil his right to be the heir to one of the underwater kingdoms of atlantis even though he is a half breed his half brother orm patrick wilson is dangerous and plans to destroy the land worldorm is in cahoots with black manta yahya abdulmateen ii who launches a submarine attack on atlantis giving orm an excuse to go to war black manta also has his own reasons to killhowever in order to be the rightful king must find a legendary trident once forged by poseidon his sword in the stonejason momoa is a limited actor he is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips amber heard is suitably sexy dolph lundgren has a lot of screen time patrick wilson is not a delicious villain in the mould of lokithere are a lot of action scenes some of it is well realised james wan has done a good job in pulling off this film it is overlong but at least it did not end up in a watery grave,fantasy
i know im probably causing waves here but i clearly see why this made so much across the seas its just so basicawww james wan how youve been bought out i mean good for you as a director and creator youve come so farto earn so much but youve also left your soul behind in that dirty saw basement to enter the depths of the oceans and sell out to dcbut anyways i didnt hate this movie it was so much like black panther  just ok so mediocre so bland so formulaic there was nothing new hereaside from so many swear words that were just added in for depth the edge now im no prude i swear up and down but here it felt forcedanyways we have reluctant whos hellbent on not being the king hes supposed to be that he journeys the entire movie to become said king oh and insert sets conflicts and villains abc on his journey and lest i forget his relationship with notscarlett johansson plays a partso this fishouttawaterfilm is the classic tale of selfdiscovery with a 1000 cgi though i am noooo cgi fan i guess theres really little alternative here we have the little mermaid made into a liveaction battle  la the phantom menaceand now back to knocking the lands across the ocean they see 1 movie for every 100 i see so yeah i have a right to say this was bad overall though still watchable its just not great as lets earn a billion and become the greatest dceu film its certainly not the best but i can see where people connected with itjust wish they wouldve explored the whole pollution thing a tad farther yeah us humans suck and its only briefly mentioned here stand up stop polluting the oceans and its sooo beyond those damn strawsfinal thoughts yep this is the highest grossing worldwide dceu movie but far from the best one1 batman v superman dawn of justice ultimate edition2 man of steel3 wonder woman4 suicide squad extended cut56 justice league,fantasy
 is a blastdc got everything right for a change and in doing so james wan conjures pun intended a level of entertainment that bests their greatest in this decade wonder woman the humor action acting editing all are spot on for a change and jason momoa as is as inspired a choice as gal gadot wasthis connected universe thing is not dcs cup of tea they never established the characters well enough to connect them like marvel did and each movie was tonally different dcs 2018 shift towards independent disconnected universe way is far better than them copying the marvel way though introduced in fine style in 2017s justice league is a remnant of their connected strategy momoa isnt the only guy bringing the house down though the key guy here is james wan wan has injected a sense of fun that helps entertain a wider audience which dc so far lacked not that he has given up on his horror roots some of the sea creatures and inspiring visuals will not look out of place in the conjuring universewatching a comic book movie requires you to enter into the theater with an open mind in this case that is an underwater world complete with shark and whale riders highways for turtlecabs sea horses that are quite literally sea horses bongo playing octopuses giant prehistoric monsters pink haired dolph lungdren you get the idea picks up where steppenwolf is defeated in justice league and people of earth know of a sea dweller who is out to help them a backstory gives arthur currys origin eldest son of the queen of atlantis who fell in love with a lighthouse keeper she was apparently executed for her infidelity but you know dc movies are all about mommies so hold that thought arthurs half brother orm wants to unite all the undersea kingdoms yes there are 7 and wage war with donald trump and the rest of us genteel land dwellers because of global warming ocean trash pollution etc only arthur can take him on but for that he needs the trident of atlan he is helped by mera daughter of sir pink hair dolph and vulko counselor of atlantis while in his way stands orm and his dreams of becoming ocean master and his comic book nemesis black mantaarthur curry im no leader im not a kingmera atlantis has always had a king now it needs something morearthur curry well what could be greater than a kingmera a heroin one fell swoop wan provides an exciting origin story for both hero and villain a believable romantic angle and an emotional family drama replete with epic battle scenes that shade star wars and thrilling expedition sequences that match up to indiana jones momoa plays as he played khal drogo brashness and physicality that he has made his own along with doses of humor and charm no lasso of truth required for him to lay out his feelings for mera speaking of whom mera is perhaps amber heards first big budget role and she fits the atlantean princess to the t nicole kidman is the most charming dc superhero mommy and yahya abdul mateen is a passionate black manta patrick wilson as orm is probably the only miscasting but he too gamely plays alongmany thought this years greatest spectacle was avengersinfinity war but do watch and you may be pleasantly surprised,fantasy
 was so so so so so so bad it started out mindnumbingly predictable but i thought well it might still be a fun colourful bit of disposable fluff regardless but then it got worse and worse and worse and worse and worsenot one single character behaved in an interesting believable or relatable manner and the script appeared to have been written by someone who had never actually seen a movie before but had instead been raised exclusively on world of warcraftand actually the experience of the film was more like one of those youtube videos watching someone else playing a video game passively observing someone else constantly unlocking levels and being fed endless new challenges now you gotta get the other trident with no reason for any of them to matter to the viewerevery attempt at humour fell flat and seemed out of character for characters that paradoxically had no character and every time any of the actors and particularly the actresses had to do anything but walk forward in a straight line they were replaced by terrible computer game cgi animation i was trying to figure out if any of the scenes were not just shot in a big green room but i could only count about fourthe only positive thing i could find to say about the whole embarrassing affair is that sometimes the pretty coloured lights looked sorta nice once in awhile that really is it for a 200000000 budgetmy god its bad even captain marvel has to be better than this,fantasy
not as good as i expected it to be the script was cheesy the music was dramatic storyline rushed and the special effects were mediocre i was hoping it would have been another great superhero movie but was very disappointed,fantasy
 is an exciting and enthralling adventure that must be seen on the big screen it offers one of the best stories produced so far by dcs cinematic universethe visual effects in are spectacular the film is reminiscent of tron avatar how to train your dragon and star wars in its creation of the world of atlantis on screen as a fan of the comics the vivid colours and comic accurate costumes are so pleasing to see cinematically it is clear to see that director james wan has done his homework however the deaging effect used on temuera morrison is a little bit distracting this is only a small criticism though as otherwise the effects are something to beholdjames wan brings everything thats good about the original source material however he also brings his own flare to the property adding horror elements that merge beautifully with the world he has forgedjason momoa was born to play in recent years has been treated as something of a laughing stock however these times are over momoa has brought gravitas to the role and has made the character very cool amber heard is also fantastic in this film adding a really interesting dynamic to the film her character surpasses the typical damsel in distress that superhero films typically have instead giving us a powerful and stylish equal to momoas patrick wilsons portrayal of king orm is good but in the grand scheme of the film yahya abdulmateen iis portrayal of black manta shines out offering a very compelling villain for future films i must also add that willem dafoes vulko really helps add authenticity to the world of atlantis with a subtle and considered performanceoverall i would highly recommend the film to fans of casual film goers but also to die hard fans the films visuals are spectacular and are also supported by a strong storyline that will keep you totally invested throughout i would give 79 out of 10 as nothing is watered down,fantasy
i have no clue why anyone would give this movie anything higher than a 3terrible plot and structure of the plot was all over the place disfunctional timeline choppy emotional scenes without any depth jokes that fell flat i mean man this movie was garbage as much as he tried not even jason momoa could save this movie there were few redeeming things the cgi of the kraken like creature and the fight scenes with mera and her water manipulation were about itmy husband and i couldnt stop laughing at how ridiculously bad this movie was and we painfully stuck around to see if it would get better it didnt keep your 15 and go see something else,fantasy
so today was my husbands birthday his one request was to see this film i agreed for the eye candy lol even when i havent watched any recent dc filmsi am a huge marvel fan and to me this just seemed like a low budget childs version of marvelthe storyline was predictable the graphics were vibrant and eye catching but just not believable  especially trying to make them look youngeri felt like there was just an action scene after an action scene with new peoplevillains to fight but no real character development and not enough of a back story to the main characterand i couldnt help but compare a few things to the marvel films1 the mother was never dead and came back to the husband who never moved on in tip top condition like antman2 the villains blackred suit was like a knock off version of antman and his name black manta is like they couldnt think of anything besides black panther and just changed it to suit the ocean3 is dcs version of thor  very manly and muscular but funny and sarcastic with his deep voice and long hairand for some reason when arthur was going to collect the trident i was expecting that singing snail in moana to pop out haha,fantasy
the endingi absolutely adore nicole kidman she is my one of my favorite actresses the story was horrible the acting okay,fantasy
overall 3screenplay 0  no original dialogue very cheesy predictablevisual effects 10  beautiful visual effectsstory 5  story was good but i believe poorly executed screenplay dragged it down to the pits actors did they best they could with itaction 3  i guess it was ok but it was michael bay action scene after action scene with no character developmentcharacter development  0  i cared nothing for the characters they were thrown into the story and the action with no development manta was just a side note thrown inlength 0  the movie was way too long i was bored pretty much from the beginningi care most about story and character development i have not read the comics myself so that is the lens i am viewing this movie throughscreenplay 0visual effects 10story 5action 2character development 0length 017  60  2,fantasy
dear lord  from amber heards terrible acting and wig so obvious you can actually see the lace front hairline through to the horrifically overacted everything that is nicole kidman  this movie is any unmitigated disasteryeah  we get it  ya read the legend of king arthur and thought youd base the whole movie around it complete with jousting rightful king and all that goes along with itjason mamoa is actually the very best thing about this  taking on an absolutely abysmal script and somehow still making seem coolbig budget special effects  so thats kinda cool  hence the two stars  but other than that  this is definitely a kids movie they should have employed the writers of shrek toy story or a docen other movies to write this instead so overall casting was an absolute joke script like inception and batman begins tries way too hard to be clever and just fails miserably its like watching 5 unrelated episodes of the series back to back the badly cast actors all overact their roles and are supported by some terribly poor acting  and wtf happened to nicole kidman and willem dafoes faces did yall think that would look good its like when they colorized movies and posters back in the 1980s  no it does not look realisticnext generation of movies people  cgiing real actors faces to try and make them look youngerjust failthis would be a good movie to watch at home with the kids  but save your cinema money for something better,fantasy
i thought the visual affects and direction was pretty good but these dc and marvel movies are all the same wonder women was great because of the story but this one i couldnt tolerate its the same crap story with different powers so nothing creative or new here,fantasy
okay i have to give credits to the special effects the movie was beautiful en spectacular but we could all gues how the movie would end in the first 20 min there were a lot of clichs and bad acting overal good entertainment but dont expect a good movie with a good story its really not,fantasy
watch it or regret laterjames wan led us to a different worldand you shouldnt miss this opportunity to be into this journey ,fantasy
it tells a predictable story thats extremely thin for the 2 12 hour runtime with characters that are hard to care about there is no investment in these people theyre boring and one dimensional dc has a lot to figure out still,fantasy
this ticks all the dc boxes  plot goodies baddiescomedy sentimentalityactionetc etc ok direction and some impressive actionbut all was let down for me by the acting thing isi know its a superhero movie and its not too importantbut it was really bad at times too much direction in the action and green screen and not enough in the actual acting department even nicole kidmanone of the greatswas just warbling on shame tho but thats my review,fantasy
after reading many highly rated reviews i had very high hopes but sadly i was disappointedvisually this movie was a masterpiece that is the only reason to see this movie too many flat and corny jokes plot generic and 30mins after the film i instantly forgot about the moviethe actor who plays is likeable and the visual effects is what kept me in my seatpeaople say this was the best dc movie of the past 2 years that is wrong people must have forgotten about wonder woman,fantasy
if you give this story 10guess russians hacker are someway sponsors of this movieits ok and my wife loved this movie810 halfnaked men but the story sckscant understand that so many 10 to this movie so something is wrong,fantasy
slept during much of this movie too much dialogue and too many lackluster lines im guessing i saw a different version than those viewers who gave it high scoresreally not worth my time or money,fantasy
that this movie is not the best dceu movie so far or even closei was going to give it a solid 5 out of 10 after watching but after seeing all the fake reviews my opinion of the movie droppedit is truly a visual masterpiece but jason momoas charisma and appeal cannot save a truly horrible script and direction that wanders all over the place and is usually too much or too little flashbacks are thrown in seemingly at random and practically give you whiplash character motivations are never quite explained the movie plays out like a bunch of different cutscenes from an video game played out in random order the cheese level at some points surpasses power rangers the tv show levels and the dialogue drops down to the level of the bad guys yelling rraarrrwhile still entertaining there are some awesome scenes it definitely drops down a cog from the we were introduced to in justice league and left me disappointed whoever was responsible for wonder woman should have got final cut on this movie,fantasy
i get very frustrated with superhero movies for this very reason every diehard fan of dc or marvel jumps on imdb and rates it a 10 making the cumulative imdb rating much higher than it should be which yeilds optomism followed by incredible disappointment i like some superhero movies but not just because i like the universe or company that makes them i think most of them are vastly overrated and diehard superhero fans marvel and dc alike become completely blinded by their love for a franchise in my opinion was one of the worst of the recent superhero movies the humor seemed incredibly forced and really not funny there was no character arch no plot development and frankly very poor acting there were so many cheesy lines that were supposed to be dramatic and awe inspiring that were cringeworthy and i found myself feeling almost embarrassed for the actors involved yes the visuals were good and the fight scenes were entertaining and well done but it takes way more than just that and a dc or marvell stamp to make a good movie after seeing my patience for superhero movies is slowly fading as it becomes obvious to me that if dc or marvel makes a movie no matter how bad it is their respective fans will immediately rate it a 10 this is slowly delegitimizing good superhero movies if you are a diehard dc fan you will probrably love whether you see it or not if youre a nonbiased movie fan who just wants to see a good film then youll probrably think its trash and be very disappointed by the positive reviews,fantasy
 is the first dc film that looks like it wants to embrace its fun sideunfortunately is a film gasping for air hobbled by a messy and overstuffed screenplay poorly developed characters and a patchwork of unimaginative action sequences stretched across bloated running time the film suffers through an identity crisis it wants to embrace the campy silver age comics but it also wants to try to be serious and feels like a patchwork of many films yet shows sparks of hope throughout with visual finnese and one of the most fantastic openings in the genre at times contains the hints of a blockbuster ready to engulf the worldfrom giant sea creatures swimming around to dafoes vulko riding a giant hammerhead shark the film doesnt lack in its imaginative ways to transform the ocean but its default mode is paintbythenumbers action by the time youve reached the finale there has been over a dozen or so clashes instead of making one movie james wan has made three or four films wasting away what could have been great storylines for future films the film never takes the opportunity of get you invested in these characters when the opportunity to do so arises its a damn action sequence or laborious exposition is put in its place just strives for sensory overload without a care for the audiences emotional connection,fantasy
i dont often write reviews but felt like doing one for thistake this movie with a pinch of salt if you want a brainless popcorn flick with lots of action then this is worth a watch its visually stunning and the actors try to do their best of a poor scripthowever there are many negatives as usual dc try to do too much and seem to be in a rush to get as much covered as possible learning his powers should be done in the 1st act not the 2nd by this point it was just assumed hed learned over time so no point having his training so late in the moviethe overall tone was all over the place one minute its serious like mos and bvs the next its slap stick like looney tunesmera was beautifully played by amber heard but there was too much change in the character she starts off like the little mermaid then progresses to black widowesque then some sort of jean grey type characterthe movie felt like it tried to take the best bits of the 3 thor movies not necessarily a bad thing but would have been nicer to see as something differentoverall not a bad movie but could have been so much better,fantasy
this movie is truly a masterpiece in the superhero genre the cinematography and visuals are breathtaking simply beautiful to look at james wan probably did one of the best directing job in 2018 as everything was just perfect nailed everything perfectly catching the heart of the characters and story and also the whole atmosphere and tone of the movie making everything believable its actually really close to the new 52 comic book run that was written by geoff johns it made me as a fan really happy seeing the villains and all the culture and people done right making the costumes for especially orm mera and final suit absolute true to their comic book counterpart it was also great cast having a well known ensemble with names like amber heard willem defoe dolph lundgren patrick wilson and nicole kidman that all portray their characters in a accurate and great way jason momoa blew me away hes actually a believable arthur curry except for the long brown hair and beard my favorite characters have to be and mera like they were in the graphic novel great duo and amazing characterssomething that kept me interested at all times were the action sequences and plot making it flow together nicely the sicily sequence and the final battle being my favorites making this movie rewatchable more than the great characters and actors they have in storeits epic and has a lot of heart thanks to james wan and everyone else that helped make the movie,fantasy
i am waiting for the kings arrival from india,fantasy
at times the visuals are mesmerizing but at some points they are distracting or even too much weak storyline with the messiest plot no chemistry between characters black mantis was unneeded especially the atlantians weapon modification scene all the music selection in the movie is cringe almost annoying zero tension for 2 hrs its boring,fantasy
this movie better get an oscar for best vfx however this story has a beautiful story as well that contains a sibling rivalry that made me choke up a bit the villain king orm probably has the most noble motivations in any comicbook movie ive seen this year,fantasy
this movie was masterpiece thx james wan for saved dceu ,fantasy
dreadful even my girlfriend who fancies the pants off momoa wanted to leave after 20 minutes,fantasy
good story cinematography visual acting and scoring cant wait for rewatch this movie ,fantasy
the movie was so good arthur made me cry give a trophy to james wan and his awesome crew,fantasy
i will break this down without any spoilers well maybe one which is not important in a visual treat the plot and script is awful im talking sex and in the city awful in fact this is actually a chick flick with special effects plot holes unanswered questions not to mention more predictable than titanic look mamoa did his best but honestly this was a million miles from infinity war or even bvs dc needs a revamp asap but if you like bright colours and want to get laid take your partner and have a drink then enjoy let down is an understatement oh and the icing on the cake the kiss with explosions as a metaphor for fireworks really worth a watch no worth the price of imax 4d,fantasy
i really dont understand the love for this film the acting is poor and every oneliner is poorly delivered the cgi looks beautiful but a film is the sum of all its parts and unfortunately the other parts put me to sleep and i missed the last 40 minutes perhaps there was something to love at the end,fantasy
jason mamoa is greatthe soundrack is greatthe actionactingdirectingstoryvillains all great,fantasy
this movie was awesome one of my two favorite movies of this year in par with mortal engines,fantasy
o filme  muito bom muitas cenas de ao a dc acertou com o filme e os atores,fantasy
ill try and keep this short and simple this is a film based on the comic so obviously this film is campy as hell at times it has some really corny lines and yet i couldnt stop smiling throughout the film jason momoa actually makes cool and really grabs the role by the reins the set pieces are epic and keep getting better through out and it constantly looks amazing seeing all the underwater visuals is this the best comic book filmno of course not but its the most fun ive had watching a superhero film in a while and hopefully this is the turnaround the dceu needed for the future,fantasy
good job james wan you rilly did agreat job  great action  great story  great visuals,fantasy
first the good things cgi has somewhat improved since the last dc movie the whole concept of atlantis was also well builtthen the bad everything else this movie is a mess i felt like watching attack of the clones star wars once again which was painful very painful bad acting everywhere and sometimes was just way too much of certain thingi wonder what is going on in the head of the people who gave this movie a 10 no man it cant be a 10 say you like a lot and you love michael bay movies and ill take your word on it but then be true to yourself and give it ah honest 7 not a 10to me it was a 4 i hope ill never have to suffer this ever again,fantasy
mr james wan do and awesome job using his experience in horror and action movies to do his best job ever the fluently of the acts the scared of the monsters the use of the colors everything is awesome handed mr jason mamoa and amber heard have the best chemistry ever the visuals effects are the best i ever see in my whole live are stunning i saw it in 3d and are beautiful i saw many people saying that the plot was a copy come on even the lord of the rings have the same plot tell me when do you see a movie that use the water sequences as beautiful as this the movie also have a lot classics elements and modern elements it have the perfect balance and although it have more than 2 hours you dont ever feel it and to many people could hurt but man this is better than black pantherbut what get me angry is that the academy snubbed this movie in the best visual effects competition that demonstrate they dont saw it or as i saw many people said it its looks that disney buy the oscars this years man is the best one,fantasy
i loved it it was amazing full of beautiful colorful scenes awesome vfx story and actors were great i will see it again for sure,fantasy
wow from start to finish i absolutely loved this everything from the story line the amazing cgi and especially the comic book accurate villains ive seen it twice in 2 days question is do i make 3 days in a row,fantasy
the messiest plot overhyped and death of logic i actually expected more come sidering the hype it had generated  but there was literally no chemistry between the actor and love interest pretty much hot grabage,fantasy
just finished another james wan directed film and it was awesome the special effects and cinematography were amazing jason momoa is the right choice for the villians and other characters were great and i absolutely loved this movie i bet even raj would agree that doesnt suck,fantasy
this movie is visually the most beautiful movie ive ever seen the acting is great great cast the music score is gorgeous and epic some movies you can critique some of the things you find not accurate or bad not this there is nothing in this movie i would change this movie is worthy of multiple oscars and is as good as the dark knight trilogy highly recommend,fantasy
i know people who watch over 5 times and it hasnt even hit dvd yet as it climbs higher in the box office results even though many critics had bad comments it appears the fans opinion is really all that matters is definately a must watch movie,fantasy
enjoyed the movie and glad the filming was not as dark as some of the older dc movies as a fan of the older comic superheroes i had trouble envisioning jason mimoa as i think jason would have made a better namorjason if mcu calls to offer you lord namor take the part you will do the lord justice,fantasy
i first knew of as a kid of the 70s when watching him in the animated series superfriends when he was teamed with his moreestablished mates of superman wonder woman and the team of batman  robin there he was clean shaven and had blond hair he was also bland as were the other heroes considering they were on saturday morning which were mostly kid shows at the time here he has a beard and has much darker hair he also has something of an attitude which is refreshing to see but hes very much the good guy and he has many great adventures here jason momoa is aces in the role and its also nice seeing that guy who was green goblin in the tobey maguire spiderman film willem dafoe play someone more sympathetic here in summary has such a fine story and great action set pieces that i heartily recommend it,fantasy
visually this movie was pretty great they crafted a very unique and cool world and met my expectations for this which was the original reason i wanted to see this movie in theaters sadly though the dialogue was very painfully corny and unnatural feeling much of the time and the acting of some of the main characters doesnt help i loved jason momoa in game of thrones but for some reason he did not appear to be able to naturally perform this role i will say to be fair that the dialogue he was served to read gave him a massive disadvantage what he does have going for him is he definitely looks the part perhaps better than anyone else i can think i just wish the performance felt more genuineanother pro for this movie would be that the action scenes were pretty strong still i found that the corniness of the dialogue overshadowed this in my mind because it was painfully hard if not impossible to ignore at timesif youre going to see this movie go in for cool costumes sea animals fantastical kingdoms superhero action fights and neat visuals leave your expectations for good dialogue and noncringy character interactions behind,fantasy
absolutely amazing movie the best dc movie so far the movie is moved from being a child friendly superhero to a more mature and serious story where it matters who you are andthe actor play is just phenomenal all of the movie characters are really well developed they have a really solid story behind them and the viewer gets attach to their story and who they are and this is made in a really clever waysin the whole movie everyone grows and developsanother great aspect dc implemented was that heroes has also some weaknesses and are drawn closer and closer to the average person and that not superpowers are important but the thing who we are the feelings we expressthe cinematography is just stunning and the special effects was the best i have seen in a 3d movie so far just amazing to watch a lot of effort was put into the underwater world they successfully recreated the beauty of the deepi have some minor complains about mera in some shots she was presented like an innocent explorer of the land and in other shots she was presented like a provocative and super experienced badass girl i dont really know what made this very rapidly change in character but who knowsbut the movie is absolutely amazing and it is a must to watch preferably in 3ddc made a shift in the right direction and presented us a great story about love and a real king,fantasy
like many other movies that involve comic characters its a constant spill of loud noises to much action empty dialogues and is lacking a storylinethis movie is visually exhausting to watch theres so much happening at once that i couldnt bother trying to keep up with the movie and eventually fell asleepi honestly do not know why people bother to make movies like this 95 of the images are animated might have left the people out,fantasy
dc movies always seem to come up short though their tv series are absolutely the worst having said that this one was one of their better showingsnot sure how much they paid nicole kidman to stoop down to being in this film but they gave her horrible stunted lines she honestly seemed very out of place and i dont blame her for thatthere was no reason for it to be such a long movie seemed to want to have big cgi scenes just for the sake of having them also they seemed to be very confused as to how indestructible should be in one scene he eats a rpg to the chest who the hell brings an rpg on a submarine and it barely stuns him and he takes no physical damage he takes a plasma blast that earlier vapourized a huge boulder and gets back up with some superficial burns he jumps out of a plane from hundreds of feet in the air and just rolls his landing yet he is stabbed by a plain old dagger and not just the atlantian bladesanyway it was a fun movie and for all its flaws i enjoyed it i cant put my finger on why marvel movies are always so much better but i think a part of it is that they dont take themselves too seriously or are able to give that impression that might be why this was one of the better dc films in that they seemed to just have fun for the most part but not entirely,fantasy
on what universe do people find this movie 10 star rating worthy  and people here are giving reviews like better than mcu and worthy of 10 dc fanboys in a nutshelli went to watch this movie as a neutral fan and honestly i was so disappointedfirst of all the cliched plot line the whole movie is about finding the trident and they streched it for 230 hoursit felt bloated this movie would have been bearable if it was an hour and 45 longthen the way he obtained the trident in 2 microseconds just like that you kidding  it just fell off completely rather than being a satisfying moment in the filmthen there are huge character plotholes they are literally sea creatures so why on earth they would need a boat to travel through the sea or why would they need those underwatercrafts when they simply can swim like a literal seaflashalso it is mentioned that has special eyes which helps him see underwater even when its dark then why the heck he would need flairs in the climax sequence  and there are many more silly character development mistakes in the moviealso what exactly are powers is he wolverine is he thorwannabee wetthor more likely he gets beaten like crazy and yet he sorta is healed in the same scene and also there are no signs of injury whatsoeverthe whole story and dialouges seems like you are watching a teen romcom with childish dailouges and poor writingthe only good thing about this movie is jason momoa  they nailed it in the casting of him as but the rest is pretty much mediocre at best,fantasy
disclaimer i love comic book moviesso great to see aussie and kiwi actors great diversity and plenty of action love the angst will see it again,fantasy
bad acting poor pacing too long and too much story for one movie i must be getting old this movie alternated between cringe worthy and dull cliche romances maybe my theater was bad but the special effects looked bad is indestructible in one scene and vulnerable the next overall i think its one of the worsr dc movies,fantasy
over the top in every aspect but so good kept me smiling throughout the whole thing,fantasy
i absolutely loved ive been a fan of comics and comic based movies for a long time and a character that i found quite odd and interesting at the same time was none other than the way james wan had depicted him on the big screen is the best way possible to potray the character jason momoa amber heard most importantly james wan did wonders with this movie  atlantis looks so dreamy and beautiful the sea creatures to be honest deserve their own movies and everything else is just no words absolutely amazing itd be absolutely amazing if the next movie had another member of the justice league cant wait for the people comparing the movie to any other marvel movie is just straight up retarded or is just too obsessed with marvel and you need to relax this review is not biased at all i love both universes,fantasy
i am not a comic book fan ive seen basically all of the comic movies and this is by far the most visually stunning of them all i liken it to a new avatarthe story is not life altering but the sheer technical and visual insanity is breathtaking the movie speaks for itself as to why production was so long,fantasy
this movie was so good krampus came in at the perfect moment right in time for the holidays looks like krampus has a little gift for you aquaboy,fantasy
this movie is amazing i loved every minute of it it was funny the cast is all star and packed a punch its definitely the best dc has come out with besides wonder woman go watch it its well worth it in my opinion,fantasy
loved it fun exciting and visually amazing jason momoa is a superstar and im pretty sure hes the most beautiful person on the planet stay after the credits,fantasy

enter screen left explosionmany laughs great action amazing camera work and visuals great casting and well acted fun as any movie ive seen this last few years,fantasy
 was a pretty good movie there were a couple of acting parts from jason momoa that were pretty cringy i just feel like the cgi was a bit too much dont get me wrong the cgi was cool and looked good there was just too much of it i liked black manta and ocean master both it just seemed like manta came out of no where and started hunting mera was awesome in this movie her and arthur were a good team knowing james wan and the type of movies he specializes in i expected to see a horror scene and it didnt disappoint im surprised that that scene got past a pg13 ratingand how orm knew manta is still confusing or maybe i just missed something the runtime was a bit lengthy but still it was either me the theater or the actual movie but the underwater scenes were very hard to hear willem dafoe was also cool in this type of movie i wouldve liked to see more of arthur and mera on land it seemed like every 5 minutes the wall got blasted in by someone one of my favorite parts was the final fight scene between and orm overall it was a good movie not really something id absolutely have to see again but it was good,fantasy
this movie was a masterpiece i alteady knew that ill like it cause i really love these kind of movies it was a bit mixture of romancong the stone indiana jones movies avatar effects and the fantasy style it was not a typical superhero movie it was much more not exaggerated but epic the storyline was great the visual effects were fantastic and i really liked the characters and the humor the gags maybe manta was a bit stupid man but we could understand everybodys motivation and intentions this is the movie ill watch so many times cause every detail added something special this was not a drama so you do not have to wait for oscar winnig performances but the casting was great they all fitting into their roles and do it very believable who like adventures actions and fantasy they will love this movie it was spectacular in every term 1010,fantasy
i seen this film and the story i like that make my eyes stuck looking at the film film dan cerita sangat menakjubkan  dan membuat mata saya terpaku melihatnya tanpa jeda,fantasy
it indeed has plenty of stunning underwater and fighting sceneand each of them are mindblowingbut i just wounder why a superhero movie cant be scripted and produced to have a little more emphasis on the plots by dceu ever since the failure of bvs and the success of ww i mean at least dceu tried to tell stories of superheros weve never heard of in their distinct way whether or not they are liked by the public but now it seems like they just want to play safely and cater to most of the audience no unexpected plot twist no deeper messages to deliver under the appearance exclusive of the superherolike characters and the mythological background it may just look like a fast and furious sequelthat is a classic popcorn movie but why not only to produce this kind of movie makes them plenty of fortune,fantasy
visually stunning overflowing with things to see in every frame the cgi fights make a mockery of the black panther cgi hellwhile the story isnt quite as good but masterpiece of imagery and world building is worth it you can tell james wan directed with his horror film background there are some fun jump moments and awesome build upswhile the licensed music choice is meh the original score is amazing with feeling and great build upthis is the dc film we deserve after the disaster that was justice leaguemust see film 9 out of 10,fantasy
well i wasnt surprised before watching the movie that it only received few good ratings from the critics im not a dceu fanboy but just wondering since man of steel which i think is a future classic why dc movies are such a tough act to follow is highly entertaining the unterwater cgi is phenomenal its not about some kind of story you have never heard or watched before but jason momoa is the most convincing antihero i have seen for a long timeand not to forget amber heard shes freaking hot and was a very good joice i would say all the fish love mandy laneand now please enjoy this movie if you havent yet,fantasy
a went to see this film at a spur the moment thing on a thursday night not really knowing what to expect as id already read some good and bad reviews i was surprised to find a surprisly good film about a half human half antlatian called arthur who challenges his half brother to his rightful place as king to stop war against the humans director james wan outdoes himself by creating a great dc film that goes alongside all our favourites such as batman and superman main actor jason momoa does an outstanding performance by really embracing and taking on the tough character of the movie does however stay true its comic book by not only introducing arthurs brother king orm but also introducing nemesis manta is a truely fantastic film that dc lovers will enjoy and a movie that familys can go and see for a movie night,fantasy
 while being entertaining and having some great actions scenes and incredible cinematography is bogged down by characters who only speak in exposition and scenes that are so ridiculously cliched and melodramatic that i thought i was watching a parody at times it is a truely amazing action superhero movie but when the characters arent going thru incredible if not somewhat unnecessary set pieces the movie becomes almost unbearable with some performances that were unintentionally hillarious and a truly awful soundtrack which was offensive to the ears however despite this there is definitely fun to be had,fantasy
great entertainment movie fantasia underwater scenery with simple smooth comic story plot same as wonder woman loaded with exciting fighting sences final war sence is magnificent compared to lore the ring and very cool battle at last highly recommended for everyone worth the money for imax for ocean lovers,fantasy
it looked to me like theyve put up a really consistent unrealistic look everything was told like a tale of some other world the plot has a point although its still weak like most superhero movies sorry fun action and amazing shotsthe worstthe sidevillain guy with cyclops stuff unlimited unjustified anger engineer in whatever you need and a really exaggerated angry face whats more hes too strong for a human on some scenes maybe its the suit well never know not when his fathers life depends on it for certain not very believablethe killings to be a hero who wants to end a war he may have been too commited on making fishes and sharks kill atlans to do it seems like a justification for an epic battlethe bestthe charisma on father very good charactergroupies i laughed more than i should have to thishow he got the trident slytherinlike chat althought its powers are not crystal clear to me or how it allowed them to escape that placethe recognition of human weapons destructive potential you can measure the difference between an atlantean taking the hit of a granade launcher and superman taking itconsciousness about contaminationi just hope that dc cyclops wont show up ever again as the final scene suggests,fantasy
this is one of the best movie in 2018not only show beautiful visualbut also fight scene that make everyone amazei would watch it over and over againit deserve higher ratingbut this is enough for memust seen movie 2018,fantasy
let me start by saying this film is a definite improvement from past dc films this movie felt a bit long considering its run time of 2hrs 23 mins as the epic scope of cgi scenes battled with trying to keep a simple plot refreshing it is a film of royalty and myth which rewards this film by giving it the grand scale other dc films lack sure this film does follow the typical formula but there are a few twists which keep the film from being an absolute bore visually this film is looks pretty as the nearly endless cgi serves as mostly pleasurable to the eyes the various environments of the sea vary from illuminated wonder to dreary darkness but it is satisfying to see how broad film is with creating kingdoms of the sea there is a scene where spins his trident with terrible cgi but ill ignore that as for character development this film has had more than a lot of past dc films and as an audience we learn enough about to understand his motivation this could go deeper but in an already long movie it would be quite difficult and would most likely become a snooze fest there are moments that are bound to make you smirk in the dialogue and the characters are likable enough that you dont end up hating them and might come to enjoy them during the film however this is an action film and deep dialogue is the last thing youd expect there are moments which can be a bit cheesy or over the top but it is satisfying to follow through his journey though the sea his relationships add a layer of richness which somewhat invests you in his motivations and endeavors if it wasnt for his companion momoa his brashness and over the top nature would be unbearable and annoying but she provides an acceptable balance overall this film entertains with its adventurous feel and monumental battles but it falls victim to a lengthy run time which is unbalanced in pacing i would recommend and i feel cinemagoers will feel some sense of satisfaction from dcs oceanic epic it is a refreshing take on a system which is formulaic both marvel and dc with a unique setting and royal grandeur which sets it apart from its predecessors,fantasy
one of the best if is not the best superhero movie ive ever seen,fantasy
 2018dc you finally did it another worthy movie from dceu besides wonder woman never have i expected the movie to be turned as good as this especially since the director james wan is famous for mostly horror movies such as saw the conjuring and insidiousyou can also call this movie the black panther version of dc  the plot which is battle for the throne the lost and advanced city of atlantis which basically is wakanda and the powerful villain of king orm which basically is killmonger surely there are some point which different but those elements are the most that standout to me and basically feels black panther enough for methere are some things that i must say did better than black panther  the beautiful tough and badass princess mera portrayed by amber heard a badass mother queen atlanna portrayed by nicole kidman and a better 2nd villain in the form of black manta rather than ulysses klaue besides that jason momoa is standout as arthur curry and is a truly energized fast paced action superhero movie since the beginning that will keep you amazed until the end and not realizing that the movie duration is almost 25 hoursso why the 45 and not the perfect 5 score well since basically i am a marvel fanboy and i watched black panther 3 times in theaters which is a record for me this movie cannot have a better score than black panther lol wakanda foreverscore  45 of 5 stars,fantasy
a friend of mine persuaded me to watch in china i didnt really want to to be honest but i went along nontheless3d vibrating seats imax stuffthe movie started and i was preparing myself for a hollywood mehwhoathis movie gives me the storm troopers ive been waiting to see since seeing the first scene in 1977 star wars the scene when the storm troopers had burst into the tantive iv and annihilated the rebels the atlantian commandoes are such as we have been waiting to see i believethis movie also provides awesome technology in so many ways surprisingly enough it filled that hole in my enthusiasm that had resulted from watching star wwwrrsss i cant even type it lolanyway this movie is a massive buzz in a 3d vibrating seat imax quite frankly it blew me away here and there i will have to see it again because all i can remember right now is how much of a buzz it was and how many buzzes i got from this movie and there were quite a fewthe black mamber guy is awesome behaving exactly how anakin should have been behaving as a hard man a quarter of the way through the phantom menance two crazy movies before the emperor enleashes him awesome i loved that guyi have no idea about and only recogised khal drogo about twentiy minutes into the movie lol i thought the part suited him really well him and that red headed duchessy lady mera or some such engaged me and i was mostly happy watching them banter n that when they did things i didnt like something would happen and they stop that and instead find themselves in a pickle which was goodthe visual effects range from up wow amazing and down to weird shark faces which in a way were still alright once id gotted used to them remarkably quicklyi liked the music funnily enough it was deep oceanyplatoon and spideys elias green goblin was in it too his role is kind of interesting the stuff he did n that some of it was pretty nice to watchmam was alright too i liked her its nice to see a movie with characters i like its a good thing i thinkwho didnt i like hmmm i dont knowsome say it is like avatar or lotr and in a way bits of it are you know aggregated together with bits of tron2 star wars and delivered them very well hereof course its not perfect but these imperfections give it personality few complain that the original south park drawings were not da vinci perfectthis film can tug at your heart strings and not only in a poignant way if you are so inclined and thats nice toofor me this movie was a good experience in that imax place i walked out happily after the extra credit bityeah watch that after the first credit roll,fantasy
best movie i ever saw good story good producer good actors and actress,fantasy
its safe to say that is no longer not cool the running joke is finally put to rest not only has accomplished director wan created a decent superhero film in an extended universe that feels tonally convoluted but possibly its strongest entry thats not to say its perfect there is dampness in the far corners of atlantis but my man what a ride set after the events of justice league arthur must step forward to be king of atlantis and stop his halfbrother from creating a war with the surface world theres a phrase that has been circulating within the inner workings of the internet in wan we trust a director who singlehandedly modernised the horror genre entered the fast  furious to create its best entry and conceptualised saw one of the most renowned horror franchises of all time he is what makes work he is what gives life to the seven seas he is why he is often the secret weapon in franchises he understands any genre that is given to him this solo endeavour that rarely references other dceu films conforms to the cheesiness and blockbusting entertainment of earlier successes from cringeinducing one liners permission to come aboard to humour that often falls flat i couldve just peed on it it often seems like it sets itself up for failure however because of this it surprisingly gives charm to the film and personality to its characters its so light in tone purposefully juxtaposing the darker narratives of other entries that it feels fresher than freshwater wans eye for visual spectacle and intrinsically immersive action proves that its not trying to be the next the dark knight grand in scope yet a personal tale of leadership for arthur that enables his character to develop from a careless brute to a genuine role of idolisation considering the 143 minute runtime it was paced methodically never did i feel the need to look at my watch a rare achievement for any lengthy blockbusteras the trailers suggest the primary insight into wans ambitious creation is the use of visual effects there were one or two scenes that physically gave me goosebumps the design and architecture of atlantis was aweinspiring each building upholding a sense of modern personality and each inhabitant spreading ancient history vivid neon colours invade your sight as you sit back holding your breathe whilst being submerged into this otherworldly fantasy with the help of gregsonwilliams euphoric score the world of atlantis truly came to life these visuals are then utilised during action sequences in order to stylise them wan tends to experiment with his camerawork switching from pov to 360 rotational panning to ambitious one take shots which invites you into the combat simple choreographed fights involving tridents soon escalate into kingdoms battling each other on giant crustaceans and hammerhead sharks the range is splendid and maintains the entertainment momoa heard wilson and kidman all getting involved within these sequences the performances for the most part were good momoa is in his element and embracing every opportunity as the leading actor both his physicality and demeanour suit the role of arthur curry heard was also decent as mera the two interacting with each other often to create comedic moments although the end relationship is somewhat predictable it was still pleasant to watch wilson also held his own as always as the primary antagonist kidman and lundgren though were slightly dry and probably needed more time in the waterthere are however faults that makes this a wet affair occasionally the screenplay needed more work and is the weakest aspect to the film often relying on exposition it never truly embraces its characters and instead settles for scope rather than nuance for example the secondary antagonist black manta was horrifically underdeveloped and unfortunately felt like an afterthought only showing up during action sequences and nothing more even the ocean master himself wasnt particularly developed enough to make you understand his viewpoint aside from humanity destroying its waters wan has so many ideas so many locations that he wants to showcase that the narrative occasionally feels like shallow set pieces rather than a deep story the ring of fire challenge fight sequence does accentuate the often poor human cgi turning a pivotal moment into more of a distraction i also found the conclusion underwhelming and rushed in a bid to open itself up to a sequel still in wan we trust and fortunately his trust was justified is a nautical adventure that is sure to reinvigorate the extended universe that crumbled before it,fantasy
it is not only the best dc movie but it is actually one of the best superhero movie some people will go mad at me because i said it is better than any marvel movie or even infinity war but it is true this is a masterpiece from james wan dc and wb this movie is everything in terms of visuals cgi  cinematography script and everythingwatch it in imax 3d for an unforgettable and amazing experience is really worthy of oscars,fantasy
its hard to start anywhere 5 min in and my gf and i were looking at each other as in what the   it look like one of those bad b actor movies the type of movies that usually dont make it to the big screen,fantasy
you cant argue with the fact that jason momoa is a total and utter adonis he certainly looked the part even if i didnt think his acting was particularly incredible i wasnt expecting much but i actually really enjoyed it its not the usual type of film i go in for but i did enjoy it i didnt understand why some things were happening there were odd explosions and random events going on but who cares it was all in keeping with this real life cartoon i preferred the first hour to the latter stages of the movie but overall i really enjoyedbold brash awesome effects lots going on enjoyed 810,fantasy
when i talk about movies i didnt like i like to start with the positives before i start complaining nonstop ill talk more about jasons portrayal of but the biggest thing has going for it is his casting in the central role he wills this movie past some of its worst moments i liked the design of some of the creatures of the deep the cgi is all over the place but there were moments in the movie that the look of atlantis and the underwater kingdoms were pretty cool the action set pieces also had their moments there were some fleeting bits in the final fight that caught my attention i also thought there were minor character turns that made the characters easier to relate to the one that comes to mind was when arthur and orm were about to do battle in the ring of fire and arthur mentions that all he wanted as a kid was to meet his half brother and tell him that he wasnt alone and that they could get through it togetherthere arent going to be many positives for the rest of this review the first thing that i didnt like from was how the movie expected you to be emotionally invested in things without any setup so much of the dialogue much of it coming from mera played by amber heard is just an exposition dump the movie shows you very little but insists on describing everything orm wants a war with the surface people because of the damage they are doing to the ocean maybe showing us some of the problems the surface people are causing would bring the audience around to seeing things from his point of view instead of some cgi flashes orms goal is to bring most of the oceanic kingdoms together but they have deep seeded grudges against the atlanteans could we see some of the problematic backstory that caused the clans to break apart why should we be invested in these things when we were just introduced to them and have no context seeing some of that would have been better than the whole desert sequence which had nothing interesting except more terrible oneliners manta yahya abdulmateen ii is just a hired gun for the enemy when you boil it down why do we need to spend so much time with him when you could cut him out of the movie completely lastly why should we care about the budding romantic relationship between arthur jason momoa and mera when the characters have no emotional connection when she shows up and they havent spent more than a couple of days together i could keep going but the movie acts like we already have a deep connection to arthur currie and atlantis but minus a few moments in justice league this is their introductionabout halfway through i realized if the cast didnt include so many actors and actresses i liked i really would have turned hard on this movie jason momoa has a bunch of charisma hes easy to like and that carries over into this movie there are times where his enthusiasm is so infectious that i started to get distracted from how cringeworthy his dialogue was he cant save the movie with the terrible jokes and lines he has but he did what he could i felt sorry for amber heard when i watched she seemed like she was one big break from hitting the big time for a while there to reach the jennifer lawrence brie larson or even anne hathaway level and this still isnt the right vehicle just like jason shes saddled with bad dialogue and an uninteresting romantic subplot but she gives it her all i thought patrick wilson gave the most committed performance hes a regular collaborator with james wan and while hes far from a memorable villain he really delivers his lines like he was reciting shakespeare hes the type of actor i like even when hes not in great stuff and that continues in temuera morrison was my next favourite character the best parts of the movie are when he and momoa are hanging out in the beginning and they really feel like they could be father and son or at minimum friends nicole kidman dolph lundgren and willem dafoe showed up for work but just went a little over the bare minimum when it comes to the energy in their performances the most overthetop acting comes from yahya abdulmateen ii as manta i almost was laughing when he had his big dramatic moment early in the film manta is a hugely unnecessary character in this however so ill give him credit for doing the best job he could even if he was chewing the sceneryim not a dc hater i really enjoyed wonder woman and i enjoyed suicide squad despite its peaks and vallies in quality i also like bvs it got better with the ultimate cut but its a mixed bag of a movie i went into with low expectations but the decent rotten tomatoes score gave me hope i dont think this movie was as all over the place as suicide squad or batman v superman it stayed at one level consistently but it was consistently mediocre or bad the likeable cast couldnt save this and while i didnt outright hate it between the terrible dialogue the embarrassing score covering africa with pitbull really and the script elements that feel way too familiar or were covered better by better movies think about the similarities between the arcs of atlanna and janet van dyne in antman and the wasp this is a disappointment and when i left the theatre with my friend and we were laughing at the movie this is a 510 and i feel like im being generous,fantasy
for a dc movie i am very surprised the story was good the actors too and the cgi was amazing good movie to watch on big screen,fantasy
as usual perfect action scenesthe characters are beyond doubt amazing the charming nicole and amber won the hearts of all the storyline is that of a classic superhero origin with some twists and turns overall a very good dc productjust awesome and loved it,fantasy
 is fun with kickass action with stunning visuals its a whole new experienceone of the best origin movie definitely awesome cast and direction thanks zack snyder geoff jones and james wan,fantasy
after wonder woman this film is really a must watch awesome performances from the stars great visualsa must watch in imax,fantasy
forget the plot the screenplay the actors watch this for the visual experience unlike anything i watched it imax 3d with the latest laser projection and dolby 3d sound im still reeling and recovering from the visual extravaganza from the third act of the film hats off james wan you have truly created something fresh unique and dare i say too much fun,fantasy
just wow the spectaclethis is probably the best action and the most visually gorgeous super hero movie ever mademaybe infinity war can compete probably but thats itconsidering that its a soloorigin movie this is ridiculousjames wan is an artist at least visuallyhaving said thatthe humor is weak although fun at partsthe story a bit too repetitivesome soundtracks are jaw dropping because they are so badthe villains too complex only to be in the end typical villains tropeshaving said those bad things lets remember the goodthe emotion worksthe arcs felt totally earnedthe moral of the story is actually consistent when an alarming rate of super hero movies fail to do itdid i say that the action is insanely goodi often dont care that much for the action there are exceptions and this movie just blew me away without being complemented by an awful story read valerian,fantasy
this film is the most ambitious comic book film ever james wan manages to create a make believe world as implausible as it may seems at first underwater the director makes it a make believe world james wan creates a make believe world as the likes of pandora like james cameron also in the film tron legacy james wan creates a world that is fictional but like a magic wand the film and its world makes the film a reality that you heavily invest yourself in momoa as the protagonist makes himself totally vulnerable as a man of two worlds one the surface world and the other atlanteans the story of or arthur curry begins with the coming of the queen atlanna to escape an arranged marriage and the father of arthur helps her in her vulnerable moment and a love story begins and there is a fruit of that love in a child of two worlds who is very reluctant to believe in the hype that he a chosen king like mera played by amber heard with a heroine in her own right and fights as well as momoas many times mera saves and the story is thus richerthe main plot is that younger baby brother the always charismatic and suave patrick wilson wants to wage war against the surface world and needs four of the seven oceans kingdoms to wage the war meras father is one king that supports orm patrick wilson orm tries to get at least the four kingdoms needed to make his dream war true and almost manages to do this until the true king comethin one of the side stories that is emotional invested is asked by a pirate who begs to save his fathers life but responds without a soul that the oceans rage and justice is the pirates justice the son of the dead father becomes a villain of his own who had a secret accord with atlantean king orm who gives him secret tech to enhanced himself as the pirate becomes black manta a villain full of hatred against and in one of the sequences in sicily italy the about five minutes to ten minutes through the walls roofs escapade of mera and against black manta is a very good scene is a combination of the best movies of their respective genders indiana jones in the archeological element done great by dafoe who played an adviser who trains young arthur and does indeed believe the coming of the true king himself the visuals and the technology of tron legacy comes to mind the ever made make believe world of avatar and the metaphors of lord of the rings the return of the king momoa makes a great work of as a broken man who does not have faith or belief or hope in himself but many do believe in him like his love interest in mera who always support him even if she makes many jokes on expense also dafoe as the adviser and nicole kidmans atlanna and his father senior curry many believe in the great destiny of the true king and finally when the moment of coronation happens here cometh the great atlan king remade king arthur curry himself,fantasy
a whole world of atlantis is ready for you the king of seven oceans what are you waiting for really be thankful james wan,fantasy
good scoregood soundtrackgood efectsgood moviecongrats james wan ana actores and staff,fantasy
how is this movie getting so much fanfare i loved the actual back story at the begginning but after that the script and acting was average at best every scene was predictable and the attempt at comic relief was pathetic i would put man of steel and ww over this movie,fantasy
truthfully words are inadequate to truly describe how much i enjoy this film,fantasy
great movie with amazing visuals the details for atlantis and the character development was phenomenal great story telling too best dcu movie to date amazing,fantasy
dc  fantasy adventure is an origin film of a half anlantean half human hero whose superpower is control of the sea he battles his halfbrother to be king similar to the lion king or black panther theme to be triumphant he needs to first recover the allpowerful tridentthe villain character is called black manta he is created from underwater technology and looking for revenge of his fathers death that was responsible for at the beginning of the filmthese films are very like any dc  marvel film that youve already seen stay in your seat to see the customary post credit sneak peek of the forthcoming sequel,fantasy
finally dceu has back again on th stage by creating movie and directed by james wan i never doubt to watch this movie it was out of my expectation it was the most spectacular movie the most an epic movie and the badass each character has strong character to play a role the emotional played a long when watching this movie jason momoa is matched with character amber head as mera was so adorable the black manta waa damn so good the visual of this movie was great full of colour like were living in another world world of the sea the story line all was perfect perfectly complete my expectation even more to be honest i will watch this movie again again again and againbecause i had been living on the sea since watched this movie congrat and thanks to james wan wb jason momoa amber head and all crew the isnt for the fans only but for everyone who could see how wonderful this movie is,fantasy
good movie specially i wil rate for the vfx under water dam cool good job dc,fantasy
fantastic im amaze best dceu movie so far james wan nailed it this is movie that comic book fan wanna see,fantasy
good news dc comic book fans is easily the best film in the dceu or whatever theyre calling it now  yes its even better than wonder woman controversial opinion i know dc has finally found its winning formula  using australiawhether its director james wan actress nicole kidmam among other lesser known actors filming in queensland and new south wales government fundingoffsets or using australian film and visual effects crews is the best of australia on show for the worldaussie aussie aussie,fantasy
its the best movie ever made from dc finally we got what we deserve they have done a interesting,fantasy
and who decided to paint one of the smash aliens black and give him laser bug eyes  just stop it  please  just stop now  you cant compete with real hero movies with this rubbish  its just embarrassing ,fantasy
each comic book movie that is made is worse than the last is no exception i couldnt wait for this film to end purple lights underwater do not make for amazing visuals and amazing visuals do not make up for characters no one cares aboutfrom some of the worst acting in a movie with this kind of budget cheesiest dialogue and even cheesier soundtrack to unfunny oneliners and horrible cgi and action sequences  this is a stink festthe films lead is jason mamoa  im thinking thats awesome  a hero with an edge nope hes as cheesy as arnold in kindergarten cop but in order for us to think he has an edge he says bad ass like 50 times so i guess thats all it takescliche after cliche make this film completely and utterly cringeworthy lets look at the never ending listhero doesnt want to be hero but constantly does hero things even tho they dont want to be a herosuperhero as a child is bullied only to use his powers to thwart said bulliesnews panel of guests argue over a super heros existenceboy without mother asks why said mother doesnt love him the onlyconclusion drawn by a movie character missing a parentman pulls woman to safety  they take notice of body contact and act awkwardlywoman accidentally falls man catches her holds her cuz thats what they do as they look longingly into each others eyes before being interruptedpeople actually yell aaahhhh when fallingpeople actually yell ooh eee aw when landing from a fallvillian to hero ive been waiting for this day to comecliche rooftop chase scenehero saves random child from falling object only thing missing there was a mother yelling my baby my babyi could go on and onbut marvel and dc have stolen too much of my time already never will i watch a comic book movie again  and hopefully this production line way of making movies will also stop lets as an audience start demanding more from our entertainment seriously,fantasy
overuse of bad cgi story was pretty irrelevant music is really bad and at times even comicalsome of the shots and cuts look like its from a bmovie productionsadwouldnt recommend anyone to watch,fantasy
this movie is really really bad i cant believe all the high ratings did i watch a different movie as another reviewer said its an insult to intelligent peopledo not watch this movie,fantasy
this is a really entertaining movie it has some fun action sequences beautiful cinematography and two likable main characters thats about it aside from those positives this movie is still very flawed it has a weak villian that feels to much like loki from the first thor filmyou know the movie before he became an interesting character the romance is incredibly cliched the plot is all over the place some of the actingmostly during the flashbacks is laughably bad and most of the creature effects really arent anything to go crazy over i would say that the effects are much better than all the other recent dc films but the compitition between those two is nonexistent because the effects in those movies have been awfulnow dont get me wrong this movie is a blast and thats what i want from a superhero movie but the superhero movies i love give me more than just fun they give me great characters great effects and even some solid stories personally i didnt feel the movie gave me any of that but hey thats just my opinion i would still recommend seeing this in theaters i definitely have problems with it but that doesnt mean i dislike it i had a fun time seeing it and was never bored thats something for dc i guess,fantasy
started off well with the fight in the light house good camera angles and kidman has skillsthe love story didnt work for me they didnt seem compatiblemamoa is a cracking guy but i didnt feel he was acting here just being himself he is just him in real life and his acting lifeoverall it was watchable but not memorable i think they need to start interacting super heroes together separate to justice league to fill out a storyif you like super heroes watch it if your not in to heroes watch something else,fantasy
conflicted is the only word that adequately sums this movie up theres moments that are breathtaking visually stunning with great acting and a fantastic soundtrack just as youre starting to escape into this reality something will happen that makes this movie feel like the worst spoof film made naming the films they spoof will one day be a great drinking game i wanted so badly for this movie to be fantastic  but other than a few glimpses of what it could have been its not even closethe only real way to appropriately describe this movie is like a restaurant wanting to make a signature dish and deciding that because people like burgers steaks pasta and pizza oh and who doesnt love milkshakes so for their signature dish they decide just to mix all these elements together and throw them in a blenderi really wanted this movie to be the step that dc needed to launch their cinematic universe and properly showcase their catalogue of characters unfortunately it looks like my dc universe ended with the dark knight rises,fantasy
super dull scenes only emphasized on the effects without any sense it was not worth the wait it was a pity,fantasy
this was was way too cheezy and most times i found myself cringing the cgi is horrible and there is way too much of it i went to see this based off the good score it got on here but that way completely deceiving the movie was just ridiculous and i was always laughing when i shouldnt have been the costumes also reminded me of the power rangers and im not sure if they were trying to make amber heard look like ariel from the little mermaid but her wig looked like it came from party city it was horrid i thought with james wans awesome directing that this would be great but honestly i think he needs to just continue doing horror films i wanted to like this film but was mad i spent my money to see it,fantasy
i went in expecting the worst it had its moments and was mostly entertaining the power ranger villain black mantis was downright awful best dc movie so far thats not saying much,fantasy
i have pretty much hated all of the other recent dc films suicide squad justice league etc because of their poor investment to creating a good storyline that is shared well is the first one that has actually done it i will actually purchase this one to ownthe graphics arent terribly cheesy either the story is told well without jumping too quickly or skipping over important character development its got good moments of humor and sufficient action scenes also my 5yr old really enjoyed seeing all of the sea life visuals acting wasnt too bad eitheronly negative noticeable thing was it seemed like amber heard looked incredibly uncomfortable in her costume and her scenes where she used her power were more humorous than they shouldve been,fantasy
i was never really excited about superhero movies but this one is soo good i loved it and i recommend it i didnt get bored not even for a second go watch it,fantasy
wow this was simply amazingthis movie was full of action fun my girlfriend even cried a few times in some scenes,fantasy
awesome movie perfect cinematography producer did very well  jasons acting was superb i can watch this again and again and not get bored,fantasy
best superhero movie made by dc so far the plot graphics underwear fights all are fantastic and the actors had also done a tremendous job,fantasy
weak storyterrible acting and lousy soundtrack great visuals and special effects are about the only thing this movie has going for it,fantasy
falls flat coz1 doesnt meet ur expectations half way be it avengers template predictable plot2 bad acting  cast that doesnt fit the bill n kidman as granny atlanta seriously3 weird melodrama  emotional scenes odd romance4 run the mill 20 ys old actionromancecomesy writingwatch if u got nothing better to do for 3 hrs and like to support mrmamoa like me  but i wanted to walk out after first one hr so desperately,fantasy
i had read the reviews on this movie i had seen the good and the bad let me say that i was entertained and intrigued the intense battle scenes made the movie entertaining and has amazing special effects i could tell that the director had thought a lot about this movie and how it would fit together the storyline acting effects all of it greatjason mamoa did a great job at playing the aquatic funny hero other acting was great especially willem defoe and dolph lundgren part of the amazing pieces of this film was how you saw what every party or group was fighting for you saw orin forming the seven kingdoms together to cause war among the land you saw black mantis seeking revenge for his father and of course there was arthur seeking the trident and ill say this once more the visual effects made it all the more stunning i feel like a good behind plot that was concluded at the end of the film was that they were not separate and that led to the atlanteans discovering that the land and sea were indeed not separate and atlantis was one good movie i recommend seeing it,fantasy
this movie was way too long and over the top i understand that they had to use cgi for this film because of all the underwater battles but they even used it on a dive off of a dock come on was anything actually done by the actors i know im going to get a lot of negative comments from this review because of all of the super hero fans but the acting was even cheesy i think its time to take a break from the super hero films and focus on something else at least for awhile,fantasy
watch it since wonder woman started i guess hollywood finally made a step into the right direction when it comes to dc is even better then wonder woman a realxmas wonder,fantasy
walked into the movie thinking it was going to be another underwhelming dc superhero movie once the movie started i couldnt look away the visuals were outstanding the non stop action and fight scenes were choreographed flawlessly this movie took me on an epic adventure below the surface definitely well worth the money i wouldnt mind seeing again in theaters if dc makes the rest of their movies like this one marvel wont have a chance,fantasy
 is wonderful movie its filmed like nothing before the under water sceans looks great the cgi is the best i have ever seen,fantasy
after watching the trailer i was so excited to the and finally today i have just sacked the waitingyeah is just awesome what a beauty in underwaterfirstly i thought wb expnsed 300 million but later knew that only 160 millionswow just greateverybody should watch the coz theres no reason of disappointment,fantasy
this movie is almost as good as avatar and is hard to believe that another film like this can be done better you will not be bored not for one second is one of the best movie from 2018 and some,fantasy
dont buy into the negative criticism concerning this film i enjoyed this film and it did not disappoint in terms of action adventure  comedy and most of all the visuals were epic for a comic book adaptation this was spot on i read comics and this a good introduction to the character james wan did a wonderful job directing this film it looked like a labor of love the kid in me loved everything about this film dc comic movies need to continue along this path if they want to succeed so lower your expectations if youre in the mood for good action film for the holiday then look no further the cast and crew of this movie have achieved something they could be proud of,fantasy
the movie is fabulous beautiful and different it is not a mcu movie so it gets hated on by the stans and critics jason is a man perfect for this role if you have seen in the comics was a joke before this movie and james wan has turned the table there is not any superhero more badass that,fantasy
visually experiencing moviethe story is simpleit is very lengthy film3d is just oknot good as expected,fantasy
had someone ever told me i would enjoy an film with jason momoa more than any film in the dcu i wouldnt have believed them and laughed the truth is imho this is the most effectively executed film of the extremely polarizing dcu and is filled with an array of epic moments throughout as well as a fantastic portrayal of the comic story while it might stray away from comics in certain aspects it thrives with its own distinct identity the attention to detail from wan is impeccable as usual and the visuals in this are mind blowing to say the least the world building through the diversity of colors environments creature designs costume designs and the overall perspectives are spectacular the cgi was heavily utilized but never looked cheap or unrefined and is some of the best work ive seen the characters are all acted well besides black mantas character which i thought was a laughably bad performance though maybe it was just how his character was written momoa did well enough and was extremely fun to watch but patrick wilson stole the show with an incredible role as king orm and added a whole different dimension to the majestic story that i did not see coming its clear to see why james wan casts him so much in his great films i also thought willem dafoe did a fantastic job as vulko and it was cool to see him once again in a comic adaptation i did think some of the dialogue and forced comedy was hit or miss at times and bordered on ridiculous to where i laughed in absurdity there are some really oddly placed songs in the soundtrack that also add some laughable ridiculousness luckily the story thrived so much with its triumphantly heartfelt core and exciting high octane action that some of the more cheesy parts can be overlooked its satisfying to see that wan took the time effort and heart and broke away from tired formulas of the dcu for the most part to procure an epic original adaptation that sets up a bright future i just hope the black manta characteractor will improve because if he will be the main villain he will have to be more convincing and slightly better written overall this is a fantastic film that needs to be seen in theaters to truly savor the details and grand scapes,fantasy
dc finally gets a win is exactly right its doing all the things that a comic superhero action movie is supposed to do be fun exciting entertaining funny and have plenty of awesomeness sprinkled into a coherent story of conflict that leads up to some epic final battle check check and check then they made it gorgeous romantic stylish and badass,fantasy
because dc is actually getting up and better even with characters as underrated as was like marvels ant mana good character who was not taken seriously until the moviesbut managed to make an epic character who could become a fan favorite while ant man is just good but still not greatthe special effects are incredible and the world they created is gorgeous and amazingthe only problem insee is that they put a lot of plot points at once i can see this movie divided into a trilogy an kt would have been as good as lord of the ringsi do understand dc wasnt sure if this was going to be a hit so they try to put everything they had here810,fantasy
 delivers the final blow to dceu is dead after zack snyder departure buzz  dc cinematic universe is pretty much alive at least underwater james wan successfully competes with snyders visuals but without offering questionable plot twists and oh martha scenes yep main plot is pretty much the same as black panter and dozens of others about outlaw king must accept his role as a real king with a help of a bunch of friends yes even evil brother is here a hidden but powerful contry or countries and old tradition of handtohand combat as a political argumentso why auquaman makes black panther look pale answer is pretty simple  director  screenwriters successfully adapted characters canon without disturbing modern approaches classic suits classic names minor race changes yes orm in the movie looks way much like blonde in comics but it was not wans descision to hire momoa as a title herowe see a very classy oldschool adventure wan even cited inidiana jones as a reference  and yep spitit of indiana is indeed here in a good wayacting is solid without spectactular perfomances but patrick wilson can be names as the most remarkable actor from enseble his villain delivers belivable emotions and motivation is not so dumb as like thanos for eg under similar circumstancesjason momoa plays a cool bikeroutlawstyle guy the only problem with him  he cannot act really good there is a big potential but he definitely needs to improve momoa made his comeback in smal roles like drogo but he is not a leading man material see his conan for eg with momoa directors are facing the similar problem as with gal gadot a beatutiful human being looks incredible on posters but impression fades once they try to act wonder woman was saved by chris pine  his team  they delivered most of fun but was not able to offer something like that amber heard is a bad actress her red wig looked really cheap zero chemistry between mera and arthur  nuff said love part of the story is a hitandmiss without a questionsoundtrack is ok but really really delivers the exceptional underwater wold it looks incredibly amazing with love  care with many details for comic geeks a spectacular journey with a secondary villain for sequel  yep black mantha should really shine his motivation is pretty understandable and actor definitely needs more screen timewb you should negotiate with james wan immidiately you know right now you have your own lucascameron  class director,fantasy
good film good storythis is the best film from dc,fantasy
i saw a preview screening in florida wow loved itwords beautiful to look at visually kind of reminds me of tron legacy but underwater funnyfunentertaining cool looking characterscostumes great art direction cool score that reminds me of vangelis bladerunnerim a fan of all comic book movies but here is my takemarvel movies are safe they are entertaining but reminiscent of usa network shows like burn notice there are fightsweaponsgunsexplosions yet no blooddeathbad language to me there isnt much to be surprised about yet great to watchdc movies are more crazy  almost like amc network shows like breaking badwalking dead with some goreblooddeathsexuality  nudityfoul languageetc is almost a bridge between both worlds marveldcthat being said i loved  its my favorite comic book movie to dateim in my mid30s and i remember reading the characters comicscartoons a little as a kid  i had the super friendssuper powers toys and the producers got the character perfect for current pop culture here jason momoa is an actor that youll like immediately on impact like when i was a kid watching schwarzenegger flicksthe only annoying thing about this movie was the people in the theater around me kept gasping and getting very excited in a good way at the actionscale of what was exhilarating them it was distracting and this movie pulls you inengages youits the first time in a long time that i remember saying to myself i really dont want this to endthats how much i enjoyed,fantasy
so first of all  this was a great movie comic accurate fun to watch and thank god properly directedas great it was it did have a few hiccups i wont say that the story was bad it was fun and exciting but somethings felt rushed and forced i wont name them but youll get it but it is definitely a must watch everything good about was shown incrediblyoverall amazing movie not perfect but definitely a step in the right direction,fantasy
saw it today and i must say its terrific after justice league poor performance this movie will save dc when i had watch the trailer from that onwards i was very excited to watch it and it has reached to my expectationssometime you will feel that there is some flaws in the movie but its visual effects and action sequences let you forget those flaws by giving james wan to direct this movie dc has really done a great jobjason momoa as is perfect go watch it you will really appreciate this movie,fantasy
 is visually stunning with a great story a few battle scenes where it is very hard to see what is going on but still a great story with great effects is probably the best dceu movie yet,fantasy
amazing dc has always amazes me with great visualization of their movies but is in the different class,fantasy
great story great visuals great acting and superb ending it was really time someone made great againgives me hope for the next superhero movies coming,fantasy
if you love over the top  leave your brain at home entertainment then this the film for youworth a trip to the cinema,fantasy
wont be suprised if it gets academy award for visual effects and production design dialogues are cringy but the cast has given everything they can to produce a masterpiece the movie feels like a testerone charged rocket which keeps exploding every few minutes avatar grade cgi workthat being said editing could have been better since this was supposed to be an origins story which are generally all goodinsert wonder woman still dcs finest jeweland yeah amber you beauty i dont know how many times i will fall in love with you after i saw you in never back down for the first time,fantasy
went into the theater with low expectation but came out fully satisfiedthe visual effect is just too awesome making avatar looks so normal,fantasy
stunning visualsjasons screen presencewans directionsurely a treat to watch,fantasy
i think that dcs awake at last and i believe that dc will rule the future cause its begun,fantasy
i just got home from seeing an advance sceening of and im really geeking out i keep trying to replay the movie and be rational professional or somewhat critical but im drawing blanks i thoroughly enjoyed myself fantastic rocky 3 indiana jones avatar stellar cast equals,fantasy
super movie such a great visual treat want to watch one more time in theatre best cbm movie of the year ,fantasy
visually stunning to all of the people that said that the dc ship had sunk guess what it was a submarine and now its back on the surface every minute of the movie is pure gold i left the cinema wanting for more and i will definitely rewatch it,fantasy
recommend to see this on big screenstory is ok but visually presented wellbest actions and good use of vfxbest part is multiple actions sequence showing in one frame which is spectacular to watchthe way under water kingdom showed is really amazing childrens will definitly enjoy thisjames wan at his best is bigger than i thought and probably the best superhero flick than dc batman or supermanmust watch,fantasy
just speechless  if this is the direction in which dceu is moving then it is going to be amazing the movie is just a blast for me its the best from dceu  whats astonishing is that james wan put so many things into the movie and still managed to wrap it into this story line amazingly it is a beautiful masterclass and a must watch ,fantasy
i really enjoyed sure the story was predictable but the movie is great fun and does not take itself too seriouslyif i was to compare to black pather and antman and wasp i would say in my opinion that is the superior movie see my black pather reviewit has to be said that the marvel and dc films story lines are predictable its the characters and heart and of course action and pace of the movie that makes them characters are fun the pace of the movie is fast moving and unrelentingthe measure i normally use is when i watch a movie for a second time does it still hold my interest for me although i liked black pather the first time round  it did not hold my interest the send timeanyway is just a fun movie dont take it too seriously and you will probably enjoy it,fantasy
go see this movie pretty fun and visually stunning effect under the water and jason momoa is born for this role,fantasy
the movie introduces the character in a perfect way the storytelling and transition between scenes are superb and exactly in style that a superhero movie needs the main villain orm was written straight from the source material and brought to screen by stellar performance by patrick wilson orm is that kind of villain that you want to hate but you just cant he is a major badass and you can see that shred of goodness in him supporting villain who completely takes the screen in every scene he is in black manta sets the foundation for his very bright future in this franchise yahya abdulmateen ii truly does justice to the character amber heard does very well as mera you can really see that chemistry between her and momoa which results in a great relationship on screen willem dafoe makes a surprisingly good vulko and dolph lundgren is playing a typical dolph lundgren character and of course he does it just right nicole kidman was good but missed something the scenes seemed a little bit too much or other times too little not that she didnt do a good job but the rest of the cast did brilliant so at least to me she was a little bit underwhelming momoa is definitely the man for the role he plays that you wouldnt want to mess with but also the one who youd share a drink with throughout the film he transforms and shows us that he can be much more than a tough beer loving dude cant give it a perfect 10 because of some cheesy scenes  which were put just for the sakes of humor but even those scenes seem to fill the movie in a good way so you dont feel bored for a single moment in the end its a really fun ride that will take you through an amazing world with astonishing visuals and a great story to hear the movie sets up the stage for the next instalment in a great way and takes arthur to a whole new level which will be interesting to see in next jl movie,fantasy
 raises the bar for future dc movies wonder woman was a great film and i really enjoyed justice league but has raised the bar i hope the dc films continue with this standard i highly recommend this film to all its got a great story a great cast and a visual treatrole on the flash and cyborg and lets hope that ben affleck and henry cavill reprise their roles as batman and superman,fantasy
better than justice league loli totally recommend this,fantasy
this one just fixed the dceu in many terms has shown that the directors need full freedom to give the best out putthere should be no constraints on directorjames wan has given his best a total team effortlets hope we get better films in this wayhail dc,fantasy
a mega and memorable for long time by watch this film a spectacular and spellbound movie must watch and feel great extraordinary,fantasy
absolutely stunning and never seen before visualsone of the best superhero movie of all time,fantasy
im not a big fan of but for me this movie is better than any dc movies even this is better than the dark knight im a big fan of batman and he was suck at the justice league i bullied by marvel fans my friends around me because justice league went gross and i told them okay lets make a deal will be the best than black panther if went gross ill pay your ticket but if you hypedsurprisedamazed after seeing youll pay me for another round of but in imax 3d and buy me a full lunch after seeing and i did it my friend who bullied me after justice league he surprised when he was diving to atlantis for the first time my friend is a total mcu fan this is the first time he watched dc movies his face was wowed he told me that he hyped he told me that atlantis is better than wknd and he lost the dealjames wan was right see on the biggest screen you can it will not disappoint you literally not as disappointing as justice leaguethank you james wan im gonna be waiting for your sequel of anyway fyi james wan fought for not to be disturbed by warner bros this is the real vision of a director,fantasy
i am a dc fan and was forced to enjoy marvel movies much more lately after the dark night everything marvel did was just beter but after the wonder woman movie there was hope from today i am sure dc fans are not afraid of the future anymore is a fantastic movie it took me back to my childhood and it did made me feel that kid againthe acting was good the cast was perfect the movie felt a little bit rush once in a while but ok we are getting a lot of info in little timethe cgi was amazing this movie a really good i think one of the best superheroes movies ive ever seen so farvery good job dc is back on track we want more,fantasy
wow it amazing vfx totaly awsome i have never seen like this movie really awesome,fantasy
what makes a film good is its cast n crew along with good storythis movie has it all the best movie that dc has created till date after nolans batman trilogyjason momoa has perfectly portrayed the character and i have to say its cgi works and graphics were too good which makes the empire of atlantis and the unimaginable sea life into realityi will not say that is a movie for dc fan but every person who has grow up reading and watching superhero comics and movies even a non comic book reader would definitely will enjoy itif dc will continue to make movie like this then it wont be long when it will again stand equal to marvel,fantasy
if we leave wonder women then its something as per the old benchmark of dc comics after a very long timefrom special effects to story this film is impressive on every frontthumbs up,fantasy
this movie is a great example for warner brothers to realise their past mistakes after patty jenkins solid wonder woman james wan has hit the home run with this brilliant scifi underwater movieprosacting camera work cgi action characters screenplaycons not much maybe needed a lil more emotional connection with the characters,fantasy
you have to watch this movie to believe the audience critics really have an agenda when it comes to dc so take their reviews with a grain of salt,fantasy
just saw it and i must say that dc is finally getting it right this time with the visuals are stunning loved the story and of course james wans showed his horror sensibility in some scenes which i appreciatethe movie was funny although with some cringeworthy scenes action packed and the atlantis design was colorful and trippy in a good way too much cgis on the underwater scenes with the actors but hey making movie about underwater civilization and people talking in the ocean are not easy so i will cut him some slackoh and great casting choice too and stay after animated credit title for the midcredit scene,fantasy
i will have to give credit to james wan and his team on working on this visual masterpiece,fantasy
this film is amazing everythings there and done so well it bright colourful brilliantly realised underwater scenes epic chases fights battles cheesy when it needs to be it is after all i loved everything about it ignore the critics giving it low scores and see it for yourself,fantasy
super awesome i love itit was a great film james wan is great director,fantasy
 have better action visual than infinity war and civil war combined,fantasy
best mcu and dcu movie after avengers infinity war periodit has perfect plot perfect battles best writing and the visuals are amazingoh man give me 2,fantasy
do i really need to say anything else the same stuff as always but produced much more professionally,fantasy
we saw an advance preview and i thought this movie was great its the same lame every action movie story stuck inside some great special effects ggi clever wrting and terrific movie setsits fun to watch if youre going to see this movie leave your critical thinking at the door grab a big bucket of pop corn and a large drink turn off your thoughts and enjoy the action story cool action and great writing,fantasy
saw this movie the other day during amazons early screening and it was amazing from the first scene to the final scene you will be engaged in the movie the movie has great comedy action and heart the special effects in this movie weere breathtaking i cant believe they made this movie for only 160 million james wan did an amazing job with movie and so did all of the actors espically jason amber and patrick there is also a good end credit scene you wont want to miss,fantasy
stunning visuals and epic cast  jason was born to be  must watch and definitely rewatch ,fantasy
what great visualsstory line is bit laggy but visual effects are amazing that dominate all the negatives of this movie,fantasy
finally dc has the sense on what they have to do they have tried to stick close to the real with a little with if humor i was scared they will spoil the true charector with all the silly humor like they did with the justice league batman doesnt smile ok i am past it this movie is the return of dc there is no hiding of the mustache with kindergarten animation nor there is the flash running like he has a stick up his u know what the animation is up to the mark and makes you want to find atlantas and stay there the action the music the cast and the story all added up they have shown the weakness of which is good they could have made skills a lil more majestic but i am guessing they are leaving it for the next one if you dont see this in an imax you are an idiotloving it in your face marvelps batman doesnt make jokes,fantasy
i dont really understand why so many people seem to look at this film as if its gods gift to mankind dont get me wrong i liked it it was ok quite entertaining had some fun bits and nice action but it was like 20 minutes too long most of the time i thought that it couldnt be more over the top until the next scene actually was more over the top and the cgi sucks on top of that the acting wasnt all that great at some times and horror of all horrors nicole kidman cant move her face anymoremaybe its the best dc films since 10 years for some ok but lets not rate it 10 stars just for that be objective because this most certainly is not worth 10 stars it absolutely cant live up to black panther if you are looking for to compare it with another movie while watching this i was litterally thinking that there is a reason why it took 15 years to develop avatar and yet another 10 years for the sequels because the time and money went to good cgi this was straight out of a cheap bin full of unicornfarts dipped in care bear rainbows enjoy the movie for what it is because it is enjoyable but lets not go over the top with the ratings the movie is over the top enough by itself,fantasy
not much to say really do not wish to spoil it but i give it a solid 910i wouldve given it a 10 but it has its flaws from time to time but for a dc movie its a 10 for surei loved the visuals after seeing so many movies with fights on earth or in space it feels refreshing no pun intended to see a movie underwater as a big sucker for atlantis stories and the idea of a underwater civilisation i am glad i got to see it on release date in the uk the battles and plot were pretty good for a dc movie again i loved wonder women compared to previous dc movies excluding the dark knight trilogy as i do not consider that the same as the cinematic universe they created after this is a huge upgrade some people said it was funny like thor ragnarok from marvel i agree but my oh my was the cinematic on point this is probably the most marvel while still being dc that i can imagine dc going and that is great really hope to see more from the people involved in this movie as they did a great job the villains put the justice league and suicide squad to shame seriously i cant believe it they actually finally got proper villains in a dc movieas i said no spoiling the movie so i am just going to end my review here go watch it now,fantasy
although some things do not work in such as the chemistry between momoa and amber heard most things are pretty good every comic book fan will feel really glad to see portrayed in a great manner the visuals and the uniforms are incredible the action scenes are wellcrafted and wans direction overall is magnificent even though it is kinda lackluster when the movie is meant to be funny overall a really good movie,fantasy
he was born to be definitely the best dc movie yet and in my top 3 comic book movies need to see this again asap,fantasy
amazing visuals action packed parentschildren love heartwarming and inspiring scriptdialogues heroic  funny as well massive war underwater star wars  cute romance  and omg he looks majestic in that original costume  planning for 2nd viewing in imax now ,fantasy
yes it is a dc moviewhile most dc movies are gloomy and dark in tone with heavier plots than those marvel counterpartsthis one might make you think and question if it is really in a dc universe story is fast pacedengaging even to those younger audience action sequences are well done and leave you the sense of satisfaction after exiting the cinema im not saying darker tone and heavier story line is a bad thingbut this one is just different dont wanna spoil anything but it is one of the movie everyone should go to this month,fantasy
never not in my best dreams could imagine something like what i just sawwarner you nailed itincredible its the best dc movie so far131 minutes of powerfull history and awsome footagethank you james wan,fantasy
 is not the easiest character to adapt to the big screen but this movie does almost everything right its comic accurate enough and not afraid to look weird or silly and it does also bring its own updated concepts and ideas in the right places the hero is likeablea fleshed out version of aquabro from justice league is actually a damn cool guy and has a definite arc during the movie where he grows and changes in fact most of the characters do the villains are believableone is maybe a bit cliche but its that kind of story and have reasons for their actions besides just having cool powersdesigns speaking of design the visual styles and design choices for characters creatures and places are amazing its a joy to journey from one awesome looking place to another in this movie and while its a 2hr 23 min movie it never drags or feels long its a fast paced action packed ride from start to finish it does everything a comic book movie should with style definitely recommended,fantasy
dc is back loved the movie it has action humor heart and it inspires jason was born to play if you liked wonder woman or black panther this one is better it even made me teary eyed just go see it you wont be disappointed,fantasy
there are no words to describeyou must see this i really loved it and the cast is so amazing just go and see this,fantasy
james wan did a great job on this movie everything about this movie makes us watch it again and again worth watch it on imax superb vfx great screenplay perfect casting and everything james wan tryed his best to make this film more comic accuracy,fantasy
the movie is very nice it is soo epic and i love the visual and the plot make me wanna know more about the world absolute mad lad,fantasy
never boring watching this movie i think this is the best animation editing from dc,fantasy
i was able to attend the premiere of in mexico city and i gotta say it stands tall as wonder woman did in terms of standalone and universe expansion for the dc extended universejason momoa provides a serious yet sometimes hilarious alongisde the amazing performance from amber heard as they both share a lot of on screen chemistrythe rest of the cast does what theyre supposed to do which is make you care about them and some of them make you despise them really fast but in a good way since theyre the bad guys big praise for nicole kidman willem dafoe patrick wilson dolph lundgren and yahya abdulmateen ii for their incredible performances in this moviejames wan manages to deliver an amazing action film with unbelievable and beautiful visuals and leaves you wanting even more if you saw man of steel bvs and justice league but you thought they could be better and you loved wonder woman this movie is for youdc sets the record straight and leaves fans waiting anxious for shazam wonder woman 1984 and birds of preyagain do yourself a favor and go see this movie imax is so worth it believe me,fantasy
finaly a great movie by dc dont belive the score the movie is great not just fun its great i mean really great the story the villans i think its the best dceu movie ever,fantasy
finally a movie from dc universe that compares quite well with marvel amazing screenplay and mind blowing vfx predictable plot but there are moments that make you say wow the way theyve detailed the waterworld needs special mentionjason mamoa steals the show amber heard is also great all in all it turned out to be a joyride maybe this is a good start for dc  hope they dont make anymore dark flicks and pls do something to fic your batman ,fantasy
visually stunning and a great story best dc in recent times,fantasy
james wan adds fiery passion to the dceu while pushing the limits of the genre to deliver a film thats nothing less than a spectacle its not only has the dceus heart it brings a natural swag to the table which alone makes the movie worth a second watch if not moreyou get swooping singleshots you get terrific action sequences and if thats not enough a plunge into good old horror what more does one need from a single moviedamn that crab was bigger than surtr,fantasy
absolutely blown away and i am a marvel fan boydc have really set the bar this is a game changeri really need to see this in imaxgo and enjoy a movie that is wall to wall awesomenot a dull second the time flew by spot on,fantasy
great a plot amazing james wan cool by momoagreat ,fantasy
jason mamoa shined in his new superhero role but the 143 min length was ridiculous as was the wannabe comedic oneliners the directing was fairly decent but i was disappointed in the writing this film couldnt decide if it wants to be silly or serious a superhero movie or a parody of one unfortunately the bloated waterlogged film is loaded with crummy cgi cheesy costumes and groaner dialogue delivered by actors who are too good to traffic in such nonsense watching this movie is like spending two hours and 27 minutes staring at a gigantic aquarium full of digital sea creatures and actors on wires pretending to swim sadly its a disappointment from what i expected and only a generous 710 from me,fantasy
it is unusual for a movie with a large budget to appear terrible within a few minutes yet this one has it all bad script bad acting bad cgi bad story  explosions and random fights cannot save that movie complete piece of crap and a waste of time,fantasy
this film was incredible there was a lot of visual masterpiece all atlantis is gorgeous this film had a lord of the ring vibe but not only some plans looks like the thing or alien in a certain way its a tarantino film with all the references i am never such happy then when a movie is so beautiful that ive nearly nothing to say,fantasy
firstly the movie was ok  just but the overuse of cgi backgrounds ruined for me the potential to be s great movie  james wan put the cgi before the characters and thats never good  the plot was non original and was never any good in the cartoons i preferred in justice league as a character  amber heard  nicole kidman and jason mamoa were great the rest of the characters frankly boring and had no meat to eat on the barebones plot  manta  cmon there has to be a better villain accessible than him so i rue the sequel i really disliked the overuse of cgi cartoon backgrounds enormously if the film was ment to be a cartoon make it so not this hybrid  very very missable and not a great movie to watch into the spider verse before im sure the cgi on this enhanced my contempt for that,fantasy
when it comes to movies about superhero kings forget wakanda atlantis is the place to be has a richlyrealized superhero fantasy world build from the ground up and full of lifeits the story of arthur curry a child of two worlds who must make peace between them when his evil halfbrother seeks war long derided by folks unfamiliar with the comics as the guy whose superpower is talking to fish this movie should show the nonfans what comic fans have always known that is a certified badasscomparisons with black panther are inevitable both are movies about superheroes who are the hereditary kings of hidden superadvanced societies but is superior to black panther in every way atlantis unlike wakanda is a true lost world a place hidden from outsiders by isolation not politics and arthur curry is a much more engaging hero than tchalla whereas black panther and his sister are confident to the point of being insufferably smug and unshakably convinced of their own moral superiority the like the batman he is no longer referred to as just hes the now is conflicted and full of doubts for all of his manly swagger he knows it takes more to be a king than just inheriting a title and his story is about his journey to become king his story also tells us that there is more to him that just a title as his mother says king fights for their country you fight for everyone take that tchallathe special effects are topnotch atlantis is not merely rendered as a place we get tantalizing glimpses of its ecosystem with atlanteans using trained sharks whales hippocampi giant seahorses and even mosasaurs which is not the only thing about this movie that will invoke jurassic park theres also a sea monster that talks with the voice of julie andrews im not making this upas per any superhero origin story this film introduces major members of the heros rogues gallery in this case orm the ocean master who is evil halfbrother and black manta dc comics first major black supervillainaside from a quick reference to arthurs role in defeating steppenwolf in justice league there are no other references to the overall continuity of the dceu which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this a 1010 rating since it takes place after the formation of the league it would have been a nice touch to mention that arthur and mera were getting a little financial help from bruce wayne while trekking across africa and the mediterranean instead of wondering how they got from the middle of the sahara to sicily it also precludes that the altanteans greatest weakness in the comics  they can only survive out of the water for brief periods of time before risking death from dehydration  doesnt apply to atlanteans of royal blood like arthur and merabut small issues aside proves that wonder woman wasnt a fluke and that warner brothers can produce superhero films on a par with the best of what marvel can offer,fantasy
sigh another swing and a miss for dcit was the weirdest experience the movie started out so well for literally the first 4560 minutes i was really enjoying myself then things got a little silly then more silly then more silly then downright ridiculous i realize this is a comic book movie but still maybe marvel has set my standards too highits not like the movie is a complete disaster the world building and production design are downright amazing this has got to be one of the most visually striking films ive ever seen and thats saying something in todays day and agethe problem is the script the premise is great arthur must find the magic trident to become king of atlantis and save the world classic comic bookarchitypal awesomeness where things get bad is in the execution bad dialogue bad acting overthetop and unnecessary additions to the plot jokes that dont work at alli kind of felt like the pendulum has swung too far the other way for dc right now man of steel and batman vs superman were criticised for being too dark and moody this one is too silly and childish poor dc just cant seem to get the formula rightthis film had a lot of potential unfortunately it wasnt realized,fantasy
new underwater storyfantastic vfxfantastic acting,fantasy
this movie turned out to be quite good after a series of bad dc movies,fantasy
as a dc fan i have been waiting for a film that can challenge marvel and here it is a must see for anyone who enjoys an action packed film for the family,fantasy
this is the movie to see at the cinema fantastic visuals great fight scenes and cgi is just something else too bad dialogue is so cringy and we could live without slow motion head turning useless bad guy who was angry at and superhero landings as well,fantasy
 was very possibly the best dc film weve had so far the other films batman vs superman justice league and suicide squad were well to say dismal wonder woman was about the same level as this if not slightly less better im gonna start with the films pros and move onto conspros actors characters action plot cgi dialogue comedy strangely music and weirdness in a fun kind of waycons the films runtime 2 hours and 24 minutes exactly so it had uneven pacing but all the while its entertaining youso all in all is the dc film we needed in my opinion director james wan isnt afraid to push some boundaries with cgi and weirdness and somewhat that weirdness appealing to me in a laughable warmhearted kind of way its also a sort of reminder and return one of the most original comic book storytelling movies since something like spiderman of the early 2000s or one of those old school movies hands down the film took me by surprise because i came in not really having any expectations for it which i do with every film unless its just terrible well believe me when i tell you the film is far from terrible its the movie i needed for the year after so many movie dissapointments,fantasy
the cast direction and graphics were excellent very well presented with amazing graphicsthe climax seemed a bit boring and rushed they could have made it more interesting in my opinion but overall a great movie,fantasy
its big its cheesy and its an absolute blast its a movie that doesnt take itself serious and its all the better for it easily one of the best dcu movies so far non stop action and a whole lot of fun,fantasy
this movie gave us what we always want from a super hero movie fun action packed visually beautiful some you complaining the story is predictebly of cos we already familiar with the story from animation movies and the comicsthe movie really embraces what it isand it delivers,fantasy
 has a strong message its not only about pollution climate change and mans complicated relationship with our oceans its about how good jason momoa looks in red lighting blue lighting natural lighting wet dry and very wetall jokes aside it is a strong action movie from the dc camp and the visual effects are stunning,fantasy
i have seen many times this movie and found that this is a fabulous movie it have awesome action thriller and best dialogues,fantasy
within the wider releases this year with the mcu dominating the superhero fiasco this movie is a great change of pace for the dceu as its entertaining with its visuals characters and story elementsjason momoa in this movie is amazing as and one of my favsthe only problem is that i wish the characters were fleshed out and the villian aswell but more or less it is an enjoyable film,fantasy
it was great and fun pure and simple especially the first and third act i plan on watching it again and buying it on bluray and dvd,fantasy
critics have made it very obvious that there job is not to give honest reviews there job is to sabotage films and people for what reason well never know but guess what it didnt work this time was to good the sad part is that there are movies we never watched based on reviews which are mostly hog wash this has to stop,fantasy
loved the underwater world they created for this film gorgeous diverse cgi environments strong story line rich in mythology and magic jason momoa engages the audience with a wide range of emotions heroic belligerent joyful grieving humble confident unsure emotions we all deal with the supporting actors i loved especially amber heard mera whos sense of right forces her to deal with a complex situation arthurs parents are everything you could want from a human dad temuera morrison and a superhuman mom nichole kidman definitely dont miss this one,fantasy
i didnt go to this movie with high expectations because the last dc movies havent been great in my opinion but was a nice suprise and i was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end performances were descent nothing extroadinary nor bad storyline was fun and adventurous,fantasy
in the realm of comic book and superhero movies dc once sat atop the throne as the champion of the real life action films about our favorite paper bound heroes as marvel studios fell into stride though and secured its regime dc has struggled to find the same quality in its work for one reason or another despite whatever source of struggles dc has been limping along from film to film only shining once with wonder woman last year that renewed life yet coming to shore this holiday season is another beacon of hope in the form of jason momoa as the champion of atlantis with the coming tide of movies can this film restore faith in the franchise  or does it fall short once more of the glory of superhero films robbie k here with a week advanced screening of to give his thoughts lets get startedmovie 2018directorjames wanwritersdavid leslie johnsonmcgoldrick screenplay by will beall screenplay bystarsjason momoa amber heard willem dafoelikesacting momoas talents as the gruff warrior continue to shine through only this time much more in your face it works well brings the heart of the film in all its wonder and glory and really makes for an entertaining hero to watch as the character develops momoa is able to go with it and it works quite well to entertain the masses plus his abs didnt hurt as the women in my showing were swooning his sassy partner in crime heard did a wonderful job stepping up into the major role bringing sass class and looks that felt in tone with the movie and a great opposite to momoas rantings and again the looks didnt hurt either the rest of the cast did extraordinary as well dafoes prowess as the vizier and mentor was like something out of a shakespearean play nichole kidmans performance held regality and love for the time she was in patrick wilson did his job as the grandiose king extreme in direction but having enough salt to back up his madnessthe visuals leave it to wan to come up with his own version of atlantis and bring with it the same flair that he leaves with his other works the studios design of the underwater kingdom is solid a blend of technology magic and biology that may seem a bit stereotypical but captures the prowess of the mighty ancient realm past the city itself the characters have a unique and fantastic design to themselves as each kingdom gets its own look to show a common origin but still give their evolution different other costumes for the warriors had their own edge to it and i personally liked meras costume feeling it was on point compared to her current modernday image and when it came to battle scenes the effects worked quite well given wans flashy approach to his films it feels like a comic book world brought to life and accomplishes the immersion into the nerd culture we love so muchthe story its the classic story that weve come to know a greedy kingdom filled with headstrong rulers whose focus on the one approach drives their goals while the other tries to find a way to his own identity for the most part it works and this has enough features of his comic realm to appease most fans with the introduction of black manta the family dynamics that are almost as warped as game of thrones and the developing relationships arthur has itself what i liked the most was that even though it is part of a bigger universe this film was able to tell its own story and stand alone without relying too much on the other films that came before it again its predictable and clich but the tale should be enough to rope people in regardless of what arc you enjoy the mostthe action you saw it in the films and you know this is meant to be one for the big screen before i even wrote these words is all about the fights and trying to imbue it with some diversity to break away from the other films it accomplished the goal of bringing a variety of styles to the mix that feels part fast and furious part game of thrones and part dc meeting kung fu special effects lit up the theater in a thunderous display of sound editing that had the theater rumbling like an earthquake i was drawn into most of the battles and felt that on some of them they hit the target in the center to really have people jumping in their seats as such despite the nearly 25 hour run time there is so much action keeping it moving you wont feel to bogged down by the time constraintdislikesthe episodic presentation wan jammed a lot of things into this film and while i appreciated the completeness i felt the movie was a little too episodic for me at points transitions between clues were a little too fast for me relationships progressing a little conveniently and quickly for my tasted to get the realistic factor while complete overall it lacks the polish of story that wonder woman held and i think it was because of the action focus of this movie which i do like but still do appreciate good storytellingaction scenes needing more depth dont get me wrong i enjoyed the action component as mentioned above however i also appreciate action scenes that are longer more developed than what we got much of wans vision was very cut and dry 5minute sequences that were impressive but short lived or sometimes more running than actual combat while i loved a few of the battles that really captured the spirit of the combat others felt too short lived i agree with some fellow colleagues that there was more choreography needed but perhaps giving a little more integration could have made these scenes shine for mecgi overuse we know these movies are all about cgi making imagination come to life but what we also know is the importance of balance and not diving too far into the realm of artificial imagery visuals were a little heavier than most like george lucas in the prequels the reliance on cgi made for some cheesier moments than i think intended where some writing lapses helped amplify the artificial feeling to it like the end fight of wonder woman the effects didnt quite add up to the picture i had in mind and when you get to how fast they skimmed over some of the battles it left me feeling i wanted a little more though to the battles at handthe verdicti could go on for hours about this but lets wrap this up is definitely one of the better installments for this reviewer finally getting out of the convoluted too focused on darker themes that the dc universe went to and instead getting back to the basics of the superhero film it is a visually packed joy ride made for the theaters as this actionpacked journey is all about showing off the technological imagination driven ride wan is famous for i had fun in this movie and enjoyed the complete tale despite how episodic the presentation felt in addition the action was very fun but i wanted a little more coordination and investment to the sequences so quality vs quantity has bounced back to the superhero movie quite well and with a little more balance it may finally reach the intended levels they set out for long ago definitely worth a trip to the theater my friends and potentially the biggest holiday bash of the bunchmy scores areactionadventurefantasy 8085movie overall 70,fantasy
things i liked1 cgi2 action sequences3 jason momoa4 amber heard5 patrick wilsonstory was goodnot the best bbu these superheroesblack panther thor doctor fate have reluctant ruler approachso go and watch it and please dont compare it with mcu films it is a step in the right direction for wb,fantasy
ill start by saying please ignore any review that is comparing marvel movies or even mentions them disney couldnt hold a candle to this film and not one marvel movie has the business or respect to be compared to not one was outstanding it had a great plot great villains awesome fight scenes and action romance comedy and it was powerful back in the day people would laugh at and call him the most worthless hero ignorant is bliss those people were ignorant and im getting all the bliss laughing here because the joke was and still is on them the king of atlantis and one of the cofounders of the justice league really took off with the visual effects and how awesome it was to see a movie take place underwater you get to see arthurs superpowers early on in the film so you know what is made of and just how durable the king really is i do hope these critics dont get paid to write reviews because their reviews are very biased opinionated obviously highly arguable and even some are incorrect the movie had an outstanding cast and is one for the whole family to see again and again i believe rotten tomatoes gave spiderman into the spiderverse a 100 and yet only gave like a 70 was a way better movie in every way so that is one example and reason why i urge everyone to go see the movie and judge for yourselfand why i believe disneymarvel probably ghost owns rtdc has put out great movies like v for vendetta man of steel batman v superman extended cut wonder woman justice league and all within the same universe excluding v for vendetta but the films nonetheless were really really good yes dc is darker and thats good they are not disney and i like that they dont pretend to be1010 final score,fantasy
all i can say is amazing and go see in imax 3d you will not be disappointed,fantasy
what a comeback for the dceu this movie is absolutely stunning in almost every aspect i was in awe with every sequence momoa and herd are great as the lead characters meras powers are so well realized patrick wilson as oceanmaster was a wonderful villain the film was quite cheesy sometimes but the numerous positive aspects trump this minor issue is an outstanding film that needs to be seen,fantasy
wooooooow im so flabbergasted by this movie i went to the cinema today with a friend and we both really enjoyed aguaman this film had everything i ask for when i watch a movie 3i found my favourite movie of all timethe storyline is epic the visuals are on a whole different leveli hope they make a part 2 because i would definately go ,fantasy
the eyes of jason mamoa will catch your attention because they are beautiful he was born to play the king of the oceanwe must give credits to the freshness of the water world sceneries the creatures and characters which were spectacular despite the overwhelming action scenes  it didnt put me into sleep at all the comedic relief was there and i like that the female protagonist was also badass and a fighter i want to see it again because i just love the ocean so much,fantasy
man this is a great movieprosjason momoa and amber heard are fantasticvisuals are on next levelsoundtrack is good most of the timethe final undersea war is the best climax in a superhero moviecons it can be hard to keep with story sometimemusic is awkward at some placebut movie is very goodall credit to jason james and amber,fantasy
 a freakishly beautiful telling of a simple tale the rightful heir must fight off his half brother to take his rightful place in the throne what the film lacks in terms of complex plotline it lavishly makes up for in cinematography stunt choreography visual effects and pretty much every other departmentjason momoa is a spoton choice forarthur curry and he carries the role on his strong shoulders with swagger and panache he oozes charisma in every scene and the scene in which he comes out armor clad for the final fight scene gave me chillsi would strongly recommend to go and watch the movie in theatres dceu finally gets it right,fantasy
 tells the story of arthur curryjason momoa after the events of justice league2017 arthur learns that he is next in line to rule the oceanic kingdom of atlantis arthur must become king  be a saviour to the world is a fantastic movie director james wan has given us an immersive world that is an absolute treat for the eyes what works in this films favour is that it is aware of its outlandish concept  embraces it wholeheartedly the action set pieces are the highlight of the movie the humour adds to the entertainment quotient of the film the visual effects are mindblowing the 3d is eyepopping jason momoa is spectacular as arthur momoa brings that much needed swag to his role amber heard is outstanding as mera willem dafoe is great as vulko patrick wilson is brilliant as king orm nicole kidman is amazing as atlanna dolph lundgren is good as king nereus yahya abdulmateen ii is superb as manta temuera morrison is awesome as tom curry the supporting cast is impressive is a must watch not just for dceu fans but for superhero movie fans arguably it is my favourite dceu film dive in,fantasy
so what do you know about any superhero movie it has good the origin story a conflict and resolution but not this one the movie starts with the preorigin of arthur curry loosely based on new 52 comics when his mother queen atlanna meets a surface dweller thomas tom curry a light house keeper she spends about 2 years with him and has a baby named after an hurricane arthur curry later to be known as before you even dwell into thearthur currys story line you come to see a beautiful lovestory between the parents and eventually same continues between mera and arthurthis wasnt just an other superherocomic book movie this had all elements of surprises with various kingdoms of the sea trench  brine the emotional development of characters like thomas atlanna mantablackmanta and even our very own patrick wilsons king orm he isnt a regular villain who wants to take over the world he has a right agenda and equally justified reason to hate surface dwellers its just his way of doing this isnt politically correct thoughthe editingnarration of the film takes you places literally i love how transitions are shown through watersun and those time jumpsi could go on and on about this but to sum it all up i felt like a child while watching this movie i was so fascinated looking at all the visuals characters and the beautifully narrated storylineps watch out for blackmanta and shin ,fantasy
well i dont basically write movie reviews ther are few movies out there for those i wrote reviews but this movie bring me here to write a review about itwell lets get into the point first is a must watch movie for all of us doesnt matter if you are 5 year old or 50 year you well definitely gonna love this movie its totally packed up movie of adventurous mysterious comedy love dramatic and action i bet you youll never get bored for a single second during watching this movie perfectly directed acted what a cinematography visual effects oh man just wowreally cant express my feelings go and watch it im guarantee you its really worth to watch for all of uslastly thanks james wan for such great solo movie,fantasy
excellent movie it is a big step for dceu is the future of dc universe,fantasy
a perfect shake of thoriron man star wars avtar national treasure jurassic park captain america with a scoope of bahubalithe best scene of all super hero movie you will get in this movieyou can say that 10 marvel movie1 dc moviedirected by james wan known for conjuring saw and furious 7 now this onebig thumb up to him what a creativity  what a imaginationthis is what i call a perfect superhero movieeverything is perfect in this movie,fantasy
i always have been a fan of justice league but i wasnt very happy with the movie we receive last time was not bad but definitely we expect more and this movie is precisely that it gives all what we were waiting in previous dc movies the storyline is nice and have a faster pace that made the movie everything but boring has very nice visuals to the point that avatar need to bring something very stunning to surpass these water scenarios there are some very nice details in the lights the shoots and the general mood of the movie is lighter than previous dceu but not shallow the main characters the villains the weapons the rides all of them are ensembled so nicely that is very enjoyable and of course that red hair  amber looks sooo gorgeous in this movie that it almost make you feel sorry for johnny deep cgi on faces are remarkable to the point you cant decide which one is more beautiful if the nicole kidman in this movie or the nicole kidman of days of thunder i really think wan has the midas touch for action movies and this one is no exception totally recommended and most important i believe this will give a good push to next installments as apparently dc found the formula finallymy grade will be 8510,fantasy
this film is simply amazing i absolutely loved it the story is great even if its nothing new the characters are very well writen they all go through complex story archs and are not the same by the time the movie ends the actors are all great  even amber heard who is not the best actor in the world far from it comes off as a believable and likable character and she looks stunning in that outfit  specially jason momoa who absolutely rocks as i mean the man was born to play this role its that simple the visuals are amazing the cgi is virtualy flawless the action scenes are relentless and perfectly staged the humor is perfectly timed to release the stress from the action scenes without feeling forced what more can i say its the best film in the dceu pure and simple followed very very closely by wonder woman and it rivals anything marvel has ever made lets hope wbdc have learned their lesson and hire james wan to reboot superman  now that would be awsome,fantasy
simply amazing moviesaw it today in imax 3dif someone says this movie is bad then there is something realy wrong with them or they just hate dcvisualy stunning great story  good actionbottom line its one of the best movies i ever saw and im defently buy it when it will be possible,fantasy
i loved this movie from its first second to the last its so good the dceu universe desperately needed this kind of film james wan is a goddamn genius everything in this movie is amazing from the acting to the music cgi everything is top notch jason momoa is not playing he is amber heard willem dafoe nicole kidman and the rest are amazing in their roles too but honestly jason momoa couldnt be the more perfect cgi is honestly breathtaking i have never seen such good cgi the music fits perfectly in every scene and is badass in some moments that you cant contain yourself from excitement this movie and wonder woman have saved dceu and it was worth the wait and the hype around it is sooo well deserved,fantasy
must watchaction  drama  flims got everything,fantasy
 is a solidly entertaining film and though it can feel a bit dragged out in places momoas performance is fantastic and the stunning visuals make for a great watch in my opinion its a huge leap in the right direction for dc as well as onpar with wonder woman,fantasy
everything is spectacular cinematography is superb visually stunning nonstop action a little bit of emotional and funny momentlove this movie so muchwholesome entertainment for families,fantasy
no spoilerthis is the most ambitious superhero movie ever and then goes on to deliver the most breathtaking scenes ever the main characters arthur and mera are developed well you can feel the emotion from arthur in each and every moment mera she is strong and passionate with arthur and mera drives the movie james wan thank you some of the camera work is like sitting on a roller coaster ride just bad assdont listen to people comparing to thor or black panther those movies were passive and lacked heart this movie hits the right note but more importantly it has heartmasterfully excuted ride only to be enjoyed on the big screen,fantasy
its wonder woman who hold the dc franchise high takes it 2 notches higherit wont be wrong to say except for the thanos saga this movie even takes the fight to mcuit has a scenic imax 3d experience treat to your eyes good vfx and the icing on cake is the plotit has a plot a sub plot and a sub plotthe director has done well to bundle it together and give us a proper ending and dont keep loose endsa must watch in imax and at last something for hardcore dc fans to win an argument with mcu fan1010  without a second thought,fantasy
 is the nicholas cage of superhero movies wild unpredictable offbeat all over the board crazy funny entertaining and youll never really know if its bad or goodif anything is a gift if this wasnt a year with a great lineup of superhero movies this would be the best superhero movie of the year and not by defaultit seems that every worlds of dc movie not involving batman or superman tragically has something great about them not perfect but great feels like everyone was just given free reign to do what they want so they just made it the most insane concept ever at the base of it its the usual heros journey but its one that on the surface has you jetsetting under and over the sea punctuated by guitar riffs one cartoonish pirate villain who customises a suit given to him by a secret underwater race in order to stop the true king of atlantis from taking the throne from his half brother therefore putting a stop to a war against sea and land a sea creature voiced by julie andrews and a cover of africa by totoits something saying that the soundtrack is more diverse and more fun than the work of hans zimmer or junkie xl but it is whether its a cool theming or the leftfield choice in covers or the neonfuelled atlantean city music all the choices are out there and work which is the lifeblood of all of this moviegiven the reigns to james wan was the best idea wan probably always more well known for this horror work at the time of writing this also gave the world furious 7 the first time the seventh film of a franchise is seen as second bestthe best like that movie wan takes everything up multiple notches crafting an utterly cartoonish and more accurately utterly comic book feeling moviethe colours of this movie leap out of you just like the colours would leap off the page were not working with darkness and shadow were not dark and gritty and the more we strive away from that in superhero cinema the better is fun plain and simple it is utterly crazy it seems to be the season for crazy given my last two reviews and it embraces it so strongly it knows just how ridiculous it isthe entire cast bring this movie alive but goddamn does jason mamoa lean perfectly into his characterisation here its the surfer dude youve seen before but here it works perfectly for the toneclearly everyone has realised that if was gonna have a film hed have the potential ridicule aimed right at him if it was attempted to be made seriously pop culture has filled the world with jokes but by the time you even get to getting a version of his iconic costume the laughs arent in ridicule its in the ridiculous of the world and being baffled of actually liking and enjoying the moviethis film is going to be divisive not in a critical way not in an offensive way but in the admission to whether you actually had as much fun as i did with this movieits got its flaws i wish there was more black manta i wish the film was shorter despite my fun and enjoyment i wish there was more bonkers sea war stuff i wish the 80s adventure peppered with romance sequence carried through a bit longer i wish for all of dc to embrace this tone its not marvel imitation syndrome its going in the ridiculous comic direction thats just fun and over the top and true to the larger than life superhumans of the dc universeits hard not to keep coming back and saying that is such an enjoyable and confoundingly weird but great time at the movies it should have failed on every level and its potentially not going to be a financial or critical hit but really this is another slice of how these movies should be shazam looks to be in the same direction so im down i am legitimately excited to see what else comes in this new world of the dc universeand youd think that of all things would be the least likely place i would have thought thata controversial in most eyes barely scrapes if at all810 stars,fantasy
okay gotta admit it was pretty sickim a fan of any superheroes movies either it is a marvel or dc though ive always had a soft spot for batman and i think thats why im a little tiny bit of a dc fan than i am to marvel but ive always knew how marvel has the upper hand when it comes to a cool awesome 10 stars worthy movie to think how most of dceus movies had been anything other than a disappointment these days its only normal when i came to the cinema without any expectation whatsoever and damn it how wrong i was turns out it was anything but a disappointment although some of the scenes were too cheesy for my preference and some were kinda boring for me it didnt overshadow my amazement towards this particular movie i dont know if its just my bad sense of humor but jason mamoa succeeded in making me laugh with some of his supposedly unfunny and corny jokes overall it was an overwhelming surprise coming from dc,fantasy
first of all anyone whos fan of comic book heroes knows that marvel dc dark horse etc have there own distinguish story tellingwith that in mind dont pay attention to any critic who compares this movies especially that family comedy movies disney creates using the marvel logonow is a fresh take on a heroe thats been around for so many years that became kind of a parodyjames wan and the crew created a breathtaking word of atlantisfull of mythological creaturesif you want to see something fresh and new action packed full of emotion movie then is the movie you should go see this christmasi wont spoil the movietake youre family and go enjoy this,fantasy

its a superhero blockbuster  we arent supposed to look at things that are meant to be just fun with criticism but i say that if it noticeably stinks it wasnt fun  topical simplistic  uninspired writing for 7to10 year olds  bad wigs weird cgi speedups inappropriateshifting  confused musical choices for various scenes humor that isnt funny armpits that smell underwater isnt funny its stupid  this stuff is for little kids that love performance wrestling  ageist  sexist with a touch of racial stereotyping thrown in  the vip atlantean woman is a wife and mother then just disappears  how original  once independent on the surface of the planet in a tight jumpsuit with dyed hair we get a later version of another female character that devolves into a concubine arrangedmarriage wife yay  the token women get stretchy formfitting iridescent costumes most dudes get armor or tactical gear sea man gets nothin but tats contact lenses hair product  motorcycle chic wearing boots in the ocean is dumb  oh you got your moms magic trident weapon thats nothing compared to your dads sacred one hers is powerful but flawed like her nice what misogynist is writing this  shes crazier than i thought powerful adventurous women are crazy garbage  all of the over45yearold actors have cgi cosmetic surgery because aging is sooo ugly  those with the darkest skin have anger issues what a twisted cultural cesspool,fantasy
very very cheesy more clichs than i could handle then the directing ouch so i actually never finished watching it its impossible,fantasy
the acting dialogue plot villains are all terrible in this moviei laughed the whole movie but there was only two decent jokes mostly laughed at not with,fantasy

if i am being honest i heavily dislike cgi superheroes and pretty much any mainstream films that are trying to be the blockbuster of the year well features really fake cgi more annoying superheroes and fails at being a blockbuster for me because i was bored uninterested and kind of disappointed half of the time is such an uninteresting character who is given no character development every other character does not matter because i could not even remember their names which heavily implies that the writing was just awful the cgi took me out of the movie so much that i felt no spectacle at all but i felt like i was watching humans stand in front of a green screen nothing felt real and it annoyed the hell out of mei wish i laughed more i wish there was more cringe scenes but honestly this film was just really boring i fell asleep tons of times and there is just nothing left for me to say i mean the enemies were horrendous and i didnt care about one single thing that was going on there was even this one bad guy a pirate that was given a montage scene with heroic music for what reason it was so out of place and made no sense he is supposed to be the evil person the mother of also annoyed me a lot there is a decision that involves her in the film that could have happened so much sooner and what ends up happening is so dumb that i was really wanting to walk outall in all not even a redhead showing off some cleavage could spark my attention in this bloated boring and really ugly looking cgifilled atrocity,fantasy
all of you 1 and 2 ratings need to stop going to movies because your definition of a great movie would suck for the rest of us for normal people this movie is one of the best ive seen go for the cgi alone stay for the story it tells they did a fantastic job all the way around ill be seeing it again soonand jesus christ amber heard is hot as a redhead,fantasy
this movie has the best special effects of 2018 and is one of the best superhero movie ive ever seen period go watch it,fantasy
this movie is awesome the action sequences are impecable and visually stunning all the actors have acted very well hats off to the amazing direction of james wan,fantasy
and masculinity i really enjoyed his portrayal of the character the only issue i had was the multiple story telling it felt as if they were trying to tell too much which made things feel rushes and choppy at times scenes were beautiful has always been the underdog hero the movie gives him serious street cred,fantasy
that was really great so much action so much to look at fun story fun acting do another one soon,fantasy
greetings again from the darkness were the tv series entourage still on the air they would now need a new recurring punchline the movie is real at the helm we are surprised to find the master of horror james wan in the directors seat mr wan is known for such genre flicks as saw insidious and the conjuring and his talent for visuals transfers well to the comic book style in fact with a run time of almost 2  hours the visual effects are both exhilarating and exhaustingsure weve seen short bursts of jason momoa as in a couple of previous dc movies but this time he owns the pool momoa plays arthur curry as a hunky beerchugging rock and roll party dude who just happens to talk to fish and breathe underwater since its the first movie writers david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick orphan and will beall gangster squad provide us the backstoryon the coast of maine in 1985 a lighthouse attendant named tom curry played by temuera morrison discovers princess atlanna nicole kidman washed ashore what follows is a whirlwind romance the birth of their son arthur nicole snacking on a goldfish as well as her first kickass action fight scene to protect her son she agrees to head back to atlantis where she faces the consequences of birthing a halfbreed with a landlubberwhen we first see a grown arthur  with a classic hair flip  he is thwarting the hijacking of a russian submarine by black manta yahya abdulmateen ii and his father michael beach if beale street could talk manta is one of the two main villains  the other being orm patrick wilson arthurs warmongering powerthirsty halfbrother sharing a common enemy orm enlists manta and provides a highlyadvanced weapon that for some unfathomable reason manta begins via montage to ironman it to another level  one much less stable its orm who gets much more screen time as he plots a massive attack on surface dwellers humans who have been destroying the sea for years you didnt think hollywood would miss a chance to tell us how despicable we are did youthe basic story is that orm must defeat to claim the throne and become master of the sea of course arthur is reluctant to get involved and only does so at the urging of his old mentor vulko willem dafoe and mera amber heard both of whom wish to avoid a war with humans the first battle of the wouldbe kings takes place in the ring of fire a royal battleground missing only the accompaniment of johnny cash the duel ends prematurely so that an epic battle can later serve as the films epic climaxalthough director wan may throw a bit too much plot and action at the proverbial wall it is interesting to note the historymythology associated with atlantis the ruling class and the missing trident the legends are fascinating and the journey takes us to all ends and depths of the globe  from the deepest seas to the middle of the sahara desert itself once a sea to the incredible core of the earth we see the ancient ruins as well as the hightech futurama atlantis  and its all stunning to watchdont tell marvel but the film is somewhat a blend of black panther and thor and momoa is every bit the that chris hemsworth is thor quite a compliment yes we find out that atlantis like our dry land world is burdened with politics and powerhungry types but the underwater world and the visual effects keep us mesmerized we see terrific dragonlike sea horses a drumming octopus and a krakenlike creature supposedly voiced by julie andrews fact or fiction there is an early sequence that takes swimming with dolphins to a level you didnt experience on your vacation and the lighting effects at times recall tron and can be a bit disorientingthis is probably the largest scale dc movie to date and director wan chooses to make a splash with every element  character mythology setting and effects we also get appearances from dolph lundgren as king nereus and randall park as a tv talking headoceanographer making the case that atlantis is real and a threat we even get roy orbison singing shes a mystery to me and the imax aspect ratio makes the first ever overthetop underwater spectacle and what a spectacle it is,fantasy
james wans vision as a director is explicit the beautiful sequences of atlantis are top notch and the evolution of sotry line is worth the watchtight action sequences breath taking underwater sequences andstraight yo the point comic storytelling makes a paisawasool popcorn movie ,fantasy
this is literally one of the best movies of the year this will get disliked because of fanboyism but i liked it better than infinity war simply because not much happened in that movie all set up and no ending and this one was a thrill ride i didnt realise this was a 2 and a half hour movie because it felt like barely an hour and i legit wanted more this movie plays out like an 80s action movie and not at all a bad thing 1010,fantasy
nicole kidman is incredible storyline is wellcrafted the movie is full of significant meanings and lessons and yes there are russians too and speaks in russian the movie promotes the idea in varietate concordia,fantasy
a love story a funny movie accion moments this movie has failed in so many ways i was falling as sleep in the theater if you want to waste your time then go but if you value your time n money dont go,fantasy
one of the best visually treating filmswatching it in imax gave an extraordinary feel it almost felt like a real onealthough the story line is very very old the making screenplay and mostly the visual experience is the one that captured me,fantasy
dont mind the critic reviews i think they are just more fan of mcu im not a fan of both dceu or mcu but im a horror fan so im already familiar with james wan actually im a fan of his works thats why i watched this because i know this will be great the film is quite long but it really deserves the time it consumed,fantasy
good news for dc the best one for the dc comics the plot climax are awesome i can this the best movie comes this end of the year,fantasy
saw film last night and was impressedthe trench scene was awesome looking forward to seeing it in imaxif your a fan of comics you will love it,fantasy
this movie did not live up the hype for me first yes there are a lot of spectacular visual shots but too many wide shots with too many little details that take away from the main protagonists and after a while they become stale second the story is weak the last fight is completely anticlimatic essentially to win a fight in atlanta you need to get the better weapon to break the ones your opponent has third the actings are subpar momoa and heard cannot deliver more subtle emotions like gadot and pine and dafoe and kidman are underused the only memorable one is abdulmateens black manta or just manta its a fun ride but nothing more however wans camera work is really next level,fantasy
although its cheesy and made me cringe at times its everything i wanted to see in an movie i thought it had a retro 80s movie vibe i loved it epic movie see it theatre while you can,fantasy
some people judgment for this movie is based on other dceu movies  dont be like that  just give it a try  amazing,fantasy
this is by far the best dceu movie now they are in the right direction strong plot good vfx cool action sequences and better acting dc is about darkness and complexity of the characters but it does not need gray gradient through out and scenes shot in dark constantly and this movie proves it wellbut one right cannot make up for all past wrongs so lets see what they make of it in the future,fantasy
the best dceu movie yet jason momoa was born to play this rolegreat action scenes and visual effects ,fantasy
just what they wouldve wanted if you liked wonder woman expect this to be better the movie is full of visual spectacles you need to see this one in decent quality every scene seems like a fight to present it as better no matter the cost the film has a large runtime than a usual starter superhero flick and thats because of the time they take to set out atlantis believe me youll enjoy it its beautiful and fascinating at times and the characters are well portrayed ive been a dc fan longer but i enjoy marvel just as well so this is unbiased a critic will try to find issues in every movie but youll be entertained no doubt and just as the movie reaches about an hour and a half to 2 hours spot where other movies would be finishing off this one kicks it up a notch theres a whole lord of the ringeque feel to the remaining quarter saving the best for last i suppose i went to watch it with high hopes being hyped at every trailer and tv spot and the good news is im not one bit disappointed but rather wanting for moredefinitely worth a watch,fantasy
awkward dialog even more awkward soundtrack that sets all the wrong tones for every single scene and terrible pacing that made me pray for this piece of cap to just end already the story was all wrong with its over cliched hero journey cookie cutter format this was literally one of the worst movies ive ever seen,fantasy
he guy who puts his face in the toilet had the right idea thats where this belongslooks pretty but story is full of holes and the film cant decide what it wants to be indiana jones superheroid rather watch batman v superman and i hated thatit gets 2 stars for amber heard and nicole kidman,fantasy
after a very long wait finally i can say what an awsome movie is it i just love everything in itif you didnt warch the movie yetthen you should definately watch this the underwater fight scene is insane and so lit,fantasy
breathtakingly almost nonstop action scenes visually stunning kinda like star wars but underwater cool fight scenes as expected from dceu movies perfect cast for the main character a lot of fun and laughs makes you think dc is going the marvel way which is the case are all the things that you can ask from the latest james wans workindeed its not perfect some misplaced or unnecessary scenes which wan couldve done better were added just to imho increase the the duration of the film rather than strengthen the story arthurs behavior sometimes doesnt befit his counterpart in the original source hes to much fun as a king of the planets most powerful kingdom hes shouldve been more like tchalla instead of thor and the resolution is quiet or at least a little bit cringe worthy for a conflict between two or more great underwater nations or kingdoms or racesat least what wan has delivered us is better than anything snyder offered thanks to learning from past mistakes and a godly touch from dcs lord and savior geoff johns though he and his wife still take the credit as producers its great to know that dc is going the right way which makes me unable to wait for their next years project shazam,fantasy
after watching so many super hero movies i found it is worth seeing a moving full of great visual below the sea the story i would say is quite old fashioned which reminded me of thor anyway i suggest you should go to the theater to see this movie,fantasy
cinematically lovely and i always thought aqua man was underrated but this movie is awful its a giant scavenger hunt to the absurd the messages are so on the nose they are painful dialogue is stilted at best and at times ridiculous a sand flea army and they still have to drive ships and the center of the earth is the land of the lost and the dragon thing guarding the sword asks something akin to what is your quest go for the imagery i think ill enjoy it more when i can watch it at home with the sound off,fantasy
i enjoyed no part of this movie none of it i didnt expect to love it because dc has a lot to learn about making superhero movies but i didnt expect it to be so bad there were a lot of other movies thrown in and the movie was all over the place as a resulti cannot understand all of the positive reviews here people awarding 10 stars should not be allowed to watch proper moviesthere are stormtroopers who other reviewers have actually referred to as stormtroopers there are dinosaurs there are sword in the stone and pinocchio references not references actually like actually just thrown at the audience is unlikeable for me a waster who just likes to drink quickly im missing happy hour ho ho the romance between him and amber heard is so obvious from the beginning and talking of obvious  the mention of nicole kidman being dead  i think maybe 85 or 100 times shocker  shes not dead after all and the whole movie happened because she was dead absurdeverything was forced and everything fell flat the scene where arthur pulls the sword from the king or something was insane  in the bad way a huge boring creature stops him until tells him to deal with it or some such thing and then says well noone has pulled the trident from the kings hand yet so when you fail im super hungry or something like that i was struggling to stay awake honestly the movie runs at around 23 days in length cant be sure so many bad jokes thrown insomeone should make future dc writersdirectors sit down and watch 10000 hours of marvel movies before starting the next flopor actually just watch one marvel film clearly they havent thus far only looked at images to steal ideas,fantasy
to put it simply is visually a treat has likeable characters is engaging action packed and is well worth the watch,fantasy
a winning formula dc have learnt some things about writing decent movies,fantasy
as a movie eater ive watched thousands of fims but i just wanna say watching aqaman is greatest experience in my whole through the life beyond the imagination welcome dc for glorious return,fantasy
iron man 2 captain america the first avenger iron man 3there is a list of movies which were not received as well as they were expected to be marvel is not perfect is a great moviejason momoa made it his own everything was so engaging i can watch it a second time without an issue,fantasy
vfx 3d visuals acting cast storyline just bang awesome movie dont misseveryone should watch this movie,fantasy
this movie is so much fun and there is so much to see beautiful and amazing cgi coupled with insane action sequences make this the best dc offering to date james wan is a genius,fantasy
while arthurmomoa charming has known since childhood that he is prince of atlantis hes been reluctant to claim the title and has instead stayed on land however when his halfbrother ormwilson really committing to the role threatens war on the surface world which could kill millions of people he has to embrace his nature the only way for him to succeed is to work with meraheard her cynicism a cover for a sweetness and willingness to sacrifice herself despite not getting along with each other and neither of them having faith in himthis is entirely unashamed of itself it is proudly and decisively going all out im not going to claim that everyone who criticised it either dont get it or dont at all have a point that its tone vacillates awkwardly between different ones such as lord of the rings epic and cartoony comic book your mileage may vary for me it grabbed me from frame one and i was with it all the way through its so infectiously in love with its world which really is unlike anything seen recently in movies from marvel or dc im not sure of when there last was a picture like this that didnt get a lot wrong there is a lot of mythology at play here thought this was about a single nation of the sea wrong there are seven those clips of a massive battle in the trailers its freaking amazing and i would have to strongly disagree with those who say it goes on for too long this has the best action scenes ive seen since infinity warno course it doesnt top that how could it possibly they are easy to follow the camera moves to take in the scope and keep the energy up they are varied and distinct from each other and they take advantage of the cool concepts at play here dozens maybe a hundred underwater creatures utilised for transport and attack as well as plasma guns and other futuristic tech although this film doesnt top wonder woman in every way its definitely in the top two warner brothers put as much of this franchise in the hands of patty jenkins and james wan and the dceu will thrivethere is a lot of scifi violence some disturbing content and a little strong language in this i recommend this to anyone who likes superheroes 810,fantasy
this is probably one of the most disappointing movies ive ever seen is full of poor acting forced humour no character development momoa is the same man in the beggining and ending saying awful jokes and fighting ghost characters mantaok super predictable like any other poor popcorn movie seems that every one of them has the same scriptstop praising this movies it really deserves worst than a 10,fantasy
they claim that best movie for dc after wonder womanare you sure poor cgi even the matrix revolution in 2003 15 years ago can do better and also to many villain not focus and some dialog sounds no meaning at all the editor should work harder to fix this 222 hours not for kids either for adults this movie is for looser so boring the acting getting worst please james wan maybe youre good at horror movies but superhero movie youre bad,fantasy
watched on screenxa spectacularly disappointing spectacle movie here is what i think1 the dog was the best actor although it only appeared less than a minute in the opening 5 minutes of the 2 and half hours lengthy movie2 the dog has expressed in its 1 minute role more genuine emotions than the whole cast including the hero the pretty face main actress and the mother reunioned with her son after 20 years3 the visual effects cgi were indeed of a very high quality it felt natural and smooth despite the plot largely runs underwater4 the script feels like it was done as a homework assignment by the writers daughter who doesnt like writing5 the pace and compilation feels like it was done as a punishment assignment for the son of the director6 despite the story has a great potential there was no substance in the movie just as an example the hero did absolutely nothing good for the underwater to be their hero7 despite the mythological nature of the story should typically simplify the creative progress of situations and the great cgi quality almost everything was illogical and incoherent as an example the hero was near bullet proof for all kind of weapons including heavy ones that explode mountains but surprisingly afraid of being biten and eaten by silly creatures with stupid teeth8 didnt feel much added value of screenx probably imax would be a better option9 i have already given enough points if you still need more then you go find out yourself,fantasy
james wan really smart dude perfect scenes perfect characters really good story,fantasy
 brings so much of what people expect out of a superhero film and more the characterization of is not only on him being a god like creature under water but also with a touch of human vulnerability and heart plus it also touches the reality of how us surface dwellers treat the big blue seajames wans directing totally fits the superhero realm as his camera work become one of the key factors on making action sequences more alive and thrillingoverall i will recommend everyone to see this underwater adventure,fantasy
 is basically thor underwater solid main lead with occasionally well placed humor good use of ancient mythology sick action scenes from everyone involved in the movie and absolutely beautiful cinematography with a diverse world that has been created under the waterthe best part is that unlike any other marveldc movie you forget that is an actual super hero because of how immersive the story isbad part is that some of the scenes feel like they are stapled together instead of having a smooth flow oh and the song selection leaves more to be desired however the music that was used in the movie is goodoverall this is no wonder woman but still a very good dc movie that is enjoyable in the cinema just for its sheer cinematography action and a good cast that gels well together,fantasy
it was a good movie acting was brilliant and hair and make up was great the cgi was quite good not something in particular i would point out but still good the costumes overall were great except for the last costume aqua man wore which lookedwell different is the word the storyline was a bit all over the place at times but about a quarter of the way through the movie it becomes a bit more clear this film unlike most other dc films had some comedy in it rather than another seriously dark dc movie most dc films are quite dark and barely have any comedy it needs that balance of comedy to get the audience laughing but still a deep movie at the same time too much comedy and the movie feels like a joke but too much deep stuff and you feel like your eternally falling through a black hole if you know what im saying there was the im going to blow you up every five seconds which is pretty much in every dc film apart from wonder woman and the original batman trilogy it was a good film and by any means watch it but if you are looking for a go to dc superherohero film the batman trilogy is the way to go or you could look at some of the marvel stuff as well,fantasy
firstly dc must have threw a fortune at this film so much that it will have to do exceptionally well at the box office in order to do the sequel  unless dc are going to throw even more money at this project without expecting something backanyhoo  the film is done very well and looks fantastic in imax 3d it is really a love story a pair of them dressed up as an action film consequently i think it will do very well at the box office and will hopefully do so well that dc will commit to always funding their films properly and employing the best talent although this was vastly superior to other dc efforts i dont agree with those weirdos who suddenly think marvel havent been producing very good films over the past ten years onward to captain marvel,fantasy
a very good funny  entertaining movie but wouldve been better without the romance nonsense when will hollywood realise they dont have to crowbar a love story in every film one scene is unbelievably stupid  spoilt the film had to knock a star off for it,fantasy
this movie is for children reallynothing special from childs book,fantasy
easily top best dc movies along with shazam and several others i originally saw this in the theater recently watched again on hbo love it very much lots of fun jason mamoa and amber heard are a great duo i barely have much complaints really this movie is awesome although my favorite involve profound metaphors this honestly is just another superhero film with not much powerful dialogue still wonderful experience regardless i would definitely recommend it for fans of the genre otherwise no,fantasy
if you overdo cgi this is what you get i understand you have to use cgi for the underwater part and the most of the effects in this film but using it for parts that are completely unnecessary i just dont get example when dad got revived and he spits out cgi water to use this technology this way ruins the mood and ruins the movie for me also the screenplay has nothing unexpected you knew from the start that his mother was still alive its a bad story with horrible jokes,fantasy
the movie was filled with poor acting dull dialogue far too many hair flips and one liners meant to be funny that completely fell flat save yourself two hours and pass on this seathemed stinker,fantasy
looks like it was made for kids sorry but sooooooo badhad high hopes for momoa really bad dialogs bad comedy,fantasy
wonderful photo and animations rated at least a 10 storyline and characters are stereotypic rated 5ish on the whole a very entertaining film with marvellous photo,fantasy
the story is awesome i became emotional and cried after watching i felt it thanks to the actors especially mr jason momoa he actually fit as the i will give 8 out of 10 to this movie the animation is great even though a little cheesy the setting is also great but it needs more improvement the way the actors portray is excellent and heartwarming they nailed it it is an adventure that i will never forget im looking forward for a sequel thanks to the writers and director mr james wan i just wanted to ask to mr james wan why is anabelle the doll sitting under water in the film,fantasy
wow this is like the biggest disappointment of the year by far this was so corny and wayyyy to animated it was literally worse than a carton the visual effects are ok i guess if you are a 7 year old child otherwise very poorly executed it was like 25 hours of torture watching it most horrible acting i have ever seen they could have picked homeless people off the streets and i guarantee you they would have done a better job acting jason is the only reason to watch it even he wasnt that good but he looked good,fantasy
the script of this movie is atrocious some of the most cliche and hackneyed dialogue ever to grace a movie the cgi was great but my god the dialogue,fantasy
its not that this movie is bad it is just how bad it is on so many levels that surprised me fortunately i was not suckered into see it in the cinema but now regret the money i spent on itunes more over the 2 hours i was wasted watching it across 3 sittingsthe scripting and story is awful and probably where the wagon fell off the wheels unfortunately the wheels kept rolling and the movie was made the general structure of the story is terrible and definitely not befitting an origin movie the universe that is set in was not explained just thrust upon the audience the special effects and design were cliche to say the least which is why one generally wants to see this type of movie it descends to the depths of power rangers the tv series not the movie with its design and special effects without the forgiving nature of the power rangers its so bad its good or at least funnyrandall park is the best thing in the movie and i feel sorry for jason momoa who had to suffer through watching himself in thisi was and am super surprised of the rating this movie received  perhaps every watched it in the cinema and succumbed to the big screen and loud special effects sounds pop boom the most fun i had with this movie was writing this review which is my firstthanks for readingadrian,fantasy
tired of lasers and robot suits ive reached my saturation point of comic book superhero movies,fantasy
i thought i was going to like this movie after seeing appear in the justice league this movie was different everything felt off and rushed with parts being really cheesey mantas bugeyed suit bad editing acting and forced lines occasionally left me wanting to see the movie end sooner than it did im normally a fan and enjoy these types of movies but this movie just didnt work the casting for the characters didnt work and there were too many inconsistentcies that didnt add up as the director forced the movie to an ending jason momoa and amber heard go back to acting school or get a role on days of our lives if thats the best you both can do,fantasy
terrible the acting was horrible the story was predictable i felt like i was watching power rangers from the 1990s,fantasy
i am honestly incredibly disappointed in this movie and the previous ones that dc has come out with all throughout the film i watched as my childhood was taken and turned into what appeared to be a high school film project i wish i had not chosen to watch this movie complete waste of my time and a waste of money for the people who produced it or pay to see it,fantasy
its pretty ironic that in a movie about fish people from atlantis the plot and the characters of have no depth whatsoever,fantasy
thanks to james wan for bring us such a great movieit really different fom other dc moviegreat job jameshope to see ur other director movie soon,fantasy
it is almost kind of a new scenario under water there are many movies that themed underwater but not with a massive empire at the bottom of the sea many viewers are hating this movie based on their personal opinions like bad story few superstars jason momoas bad acting slow sfx etc it is true that just like tipical marvel or dc movies the count of superstars are very less in this movie and that didnt made this movie bad in my viewjason momoa is a big guy and his size perfectly fitting with his character but he couldnt 100 blend with that character in terms of acting some tweaks are requiredabout the movie i like the underwater empire it supposed to be huge and massive but throughout the movie play we wont get a feel like that that is the main flaw of the movie more of a budget empire  i think i enjoyed to watch the water creatures that the soldiers are used to ride the trench monsters sea dragons battle lobsters tylosaurus especially the karathen wow that gigantic creature is almost a nightmare the director had every possible chance to make this movie great but the limitation of time and may be budget made the move average i guessone of the things i more like about this movie is less cracking jokes and more of a serious attitude of all characters throughout the movie mainly the main actors in the thor movie sequels we can see the first movie is the best of all thor the son of odin is really mighty his talking attire actions are exactly resembles a true son of god but after that movie every characters are making things less important and making jokes thor and loki didnt seem that concentrated on their respective characters behaviour this is happening with all the superhero movies nowadays cracking jokes irrespective or their characters especially in fantasy and mythological movies but is better than that all the actors are serious in their corresponding rolesi had great expectation on the coronation at end for new king but nothing was there another flaw in my view i am not going to be a complete critic about this movie to be honest it is better than spiderman movies not the old ones some avengers and dc movies with too much hype,fantasy
this movie is for the ages 716too much cgi and effectsmake the movie so unrealistic and hard to connect2really disappointed by the movie,fantasy
so childish stupid inconsistent and lameits like an under sea lame version of black panthersure its funny here and there buthe used the golden fork to bring death and horror to his people to take the throne worthy king my assthe whole point of the movie was to bring peace and unite surface dwellers and bikini bottom dwellers im still waitingin the world of superman wonder woman people are still unaware and in denial of super technologically advanced people living in the oceansthey tried buti was expecting something serious not some saturated goofy nonsense,fantasy
how could anyone give this review more than a 5 the way arthur finds out who he is is so freakin underwhelming corny anticlimactic no feeling or investment i expected so much better when i say the original 7s  8s i was gullible enough to buy that there was finally a good dc movie made the whole production must be flawed from the the top down,fantasy
terrible cgi terrible script terrible acting terrible terrible terrible,fantasy
id swear this was written by a team of prepubescent 8year olds then handed to the producers who covered up their crappy script with as much cgi flash as was possibleonce made i am sure that marvel counted on the sheep who would automatically love whatever came from the studio hence the number of fawning reviewshow long can this formula last,fantasy
turned it off after 20 minutes i wanted to like this i really really did borel claimed a million monkeys typing would eventually type the complete works of shakespeare this may be true but first they wrote the script to this dreadful movie while the visuals were striking the acting storyline and character development were that of a kindergarten or maybe 1st grade assembly production,fantasy
i did enjoy the movie actually  i didnt get bored at all but the plot was like watching a kids movie nothing suprised you and the cgi was not good actually also some scenes not many dont worry didnt have an actual reason to be therei really couldnt care less about the plot in those scenes anyway you people should watch it its enjoyable but not a masterpiece or something,fantasy
parts of this movie were visually stunning but the movie was overall too long with the story being all over the place a fight with bugs power rangerstar wars fighters etcit just felt unnecessary it tries to be funny and delivers corny oneliners overall the movie was boring if i were an 8 year old i think i would have found it cool for the rest of us it just feels blah,fantasy
movie is a total swing and a miss the entire cast is meh the plot is absolutely boring the dialogue is cringy af total waste of my time,fantasy
a real cheezy movie jason mamoa really cant act he should stick to grunting like his character in got,fantasy
i am surprised that this movie currently has 74 on imdb this would be a good movie for a 13yearold going to see their first pg13 movie  incredibly easy to follow and visually exciting as an adult i found it to be cringey and generic the whole time when you meet a villain evil music plays when you meet a hero good music plays and their hair blows in the wind  nothing is left to the viewer to figure out whoever did the music for this movieshould find a new career path there is a scene where they go to africa and a version of the song africa is playedpure cringe the characters are undeveloped and jason momoa while visually a perfect action hero cannot deliver authentic emotion through dialogue i prefer him speaking dothraki the fighting scenes were shot beautifully but there was so much screen time devoted to fight scenes that they became boringi mean we already know whos going to win the other annoying thing was the cheap strategy of having an extremely quiet moment followed by an incredibly loud noise to startle you  it wouldve been fine to employ this strategy once but it happened about four times in the movie as if the writers couldnt think of any other way to create excitement this is a dumbeddown superhero movie that you could watch with your kids but dont waste your money on it if youre expecting an iron man or black panther level of quality,fantasy
back story who needs it im saving a hijacked submarine because just because sure a lot of time wasted on his being a halfbreed zero time on what makes him tick other than his mommy issues and i have superman like powers why exactlyacting they must have busted the whole budget on momoa most of the cast is from the hayden christian school for being anakin skywalker plot were going to invade the surface world but first will teach them about pollution and put beach their aircraft carriers and that hijacked submarine it shows up in the most obvious setup and attacks for no reason and no one is even suspicious and there never is a reveal just ignore it ever happened also lets not destroy the surface dwellers that easily first we must have the most massive war amongst ourselves to insure that we destroy our own armies oh and why are they traveling in boats when they can swim and breathe underwaterdont miss the obvious karate kid ripoff sequences done without any humor or selfawareness right down to the hard to master winning kick in this case mystical water spinning trident thingycgi step above the dancing baby of years pastaction wow they just barely got away  again and again and again and again and againvillains not really just another guy with mommy issues and a misunderstand pirate with daddy issues,fantasy
i dont know what movie everyone else seen but what i watched was lame,fantasy
bad acting bad dialogue bad script bad most things still is better than that black panther garbagei laughed at the power ranger costumes and bad cgi in some parts having said that credit is due to some of the cgi however it did not save the story or acting booooo,fantasy
oh hell yes lol adventures and mayhem cgi is cool ,fantasy
ive seen it three times alredy turn off your brain and enjoy the movie,fantasy
alright well for starters i must state that i am not one overly keen on watching superhero movies because they all just seem to follow the same doctrine and blueprint but i was forced into watching the 2018 dc movie together with my familyand it turns out that it was actually a good thing that i was forced to watch it because it turned out that was actually one of the better superhero movies that have been made not that i am in anyway familiar with the backstory of the character and havent read the comic books or anythinginitially i was a little bit hesitant about the movie but it turns out that director james wan actually managed to turn the written material of david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick will beall and geoff johns into something truly entertaining and enjoyable the movie was driven by a good story where one quickly and easily got submerged no pun intended into the setting and into the ongoings on the screen plus it was also a plus that it had some rather interesting characters in it to help it along as well needless to say that the cgi and special effects also had a major role in making it a visually astounding and enjoyable movienow normally i am not much fan of jason momoa but i must admit that he really carried himself formidably in this movie and he really owned up to the responsibility of playing  although i have no idea how much pressure would be on him to play that character but he did it phenomenally in my opinion regardless it was of course a treat to see willem dafoe in the movie despite it being somewhat disturbing and unsettling to see him made young and vigorous patrick wilson actually was so wellcast for the role he had in the movie and he brought so much grace charm and wits to that dark character i had initially not thought he would be up to the task but he proved me so wrong then you have the likes of nicole kidman and dolph lundgren whom also actually were fun to watch in the movie despite them not having an abundance of screen timethe pacing to the movie was fast and upbeat and the movie kicked off into a high octane speed right from the very beginning and it never really slowed down which was a very impressive accomplishment in my opinion and it really made the movie all the more intense and enjoyable to sit throughas for the special effects and cgi well there is just really just a single word necessary to summarize the entire movie and that word is wow are you kidding me this movie takes you in for a tour de force and really showcases some rather impressive feats and accomplishments in the visual department and also in the audio department prepare to be blown awaywith that being said the movie is not at all flawless personally i found it a bitter pill to swallow the whole thing about the secret sea and what was going on there it was just too far out there for my liking and also the fact that all the marvelous magnificent malignant and spectacular aquatic creatures vehicles and settlements have remained from the humans living on the surface is just beyond me it makes absolutely no sense at allnow i was praising the cgi and visual effects just before there were some scenes when we have the characters floating around and supposed to be appearing as if they are submerged and underwater it just came off as being ridiculously fake to look at that was a shame because the rest of the 95 of special effects and cgi in the movie was just spot onif you enjoy superhero movies wait let me rephrase that even if you have no particular interest in superhero movies then you should actually take the time to sit down and watch the 2018 movie it is definitely well worth the time effort and money,fantasy
production values are great but i felt that story itself could have been better,fantasy
in my mind has the honour of being the second honestly good dc film after wonder woman and once again its due to it straying away from the usual dczack snyderchristopher nolan clichs this is a colourful action blast full of good humour interesting locations bright lights majestic set pieces and enough eye candy to paint a house with true the story is still bit of a mess its trying to do perhaps a thing or two too many at once but its more than entertaining enough to rise above such petty concernstwo great things to single out first is the direction of james wan mainly a horror director before this he brings with him this great energy and passion this feels like an epic like a great superhero film should he also has a really good style when it comes to action scenes like in wonder woman all the action scenes in this film are easy to follow mostly shot at wide view with very little shaky cam employed and surprise of surprises it makes it really entertaining to watch when you can actually see whats going on and can appreciate all the effort that went into making itthe second great thing is jason momoa as arthur curry the eponymous amazing physical presence very good with action scenes and practically made for the role despite his looks being rather far from the original character and he has some serious comedic chops which this character sorely needs because lets face it a superhero who talks to fish is not the easiest sell in the world but momoa makes it workgranted the villain side of things is still a bit lacking the story is messy some of the side characters are rather weak and there are more than a few hiccups scattered throughoutbut the film still delivers i walked out of the theater with a big smile on my face and id more than gladly see the film again and thats the most important thing,fantasy
i work at a movie theater and when i saw that we were showing this movie at first i didnt even want to watch it because i dont like the comic version but i did end up watching it and it turned out really god and i loved it very glad my best friend wanted to see this,fantasy
how can you make such a movie where zero quality exists how can you be so out of touch that you try so hard to make this movie serious and funny without even coming close the jokes are so bad and this movie is a predictable mess you dont even need to watch it until the end to know what will happen the villains are also a joke the manta guy looks like an idiot in a fanmade costume with a giant ant head,fantasy
dumbderivative and not in a good way i lost track of all the ripoffs of other movies i dont mind a nod here and there but this was ridiculous i notice other reviewers were impressed with the underwater scenes which i would describe as avatar meets bladerunner mostly i personally enjoyed the abovethewater shots much more and looked forward to them not a good sign for an underwater hero moviemovies ripped off  aliens attack of the clones harry potter avatar the matrix bladerunner the perfect storm others i cant recallthings i learned is a former pro wrestler totally unbelievable until he gets his suit later the original king would of been much betterunderwater princesses have augmentation distracting even for the star that doesnt make up for horrible dialoguewhen i forget the main villan is even in the movie something is wrongdialogue that is dumb on a level that would make roadhouse look like shakespearea couple of the battle scenes were ok but the most entertaining parts of the rest of the movie were spotting the differences in william dafoes manbunsaggressively dumb,fantasy
i liked the look of the effects in the trailer but when a whole movie is over the top cgi it quickly gets tiresome everything is turned up to 100 in this movie from the overcrowded backgrounds to the ridiculous costumes i thought dc needed to put the brakes on before but now im just thinking theyd be better skreeching to a halt and starting over,fantasy
of all the possibilities one could create a story of first years they did thisdc has sunken to a new low,fantasy
we as an audenience should not settle for crap just when more money is spent on graphics take away the graphics what do you have same old story told over and over again totally predictable and not original at all,fantasy
ok i was always a fan of dc universe marvel and i love scifi moviesi couldnt restrain my self from laughing when i noticed mera in all the sceneseven after getting out of water with lipstick on hardcore eye rimmel and full makeup i mean what the heck she should appear more natural she just came out from the water its not like shes posing for victorias secret i felt like i was watching a brazzers movie except there is no nudity if things keep going like this i might lose my interest for dc comics,fantasy
this is not an awful movie if you completely turn your brain off it is not hard to enjoythat having been said the story is weak and the dialogue is absolutely abysmal mamoa is great in this role but the character was so much better written in justice league both kidman and dafoe were just wastedi suppose that it is completely subjective but so many of the directorial choices took me out of the moviewhat the dc people dont seem to realize is that simply because a movie is based upon a comic doesnt mean that it has to be written to appeal solely to 10 year old boys characters are allowed to speak as though they are real people with real emotions and who have actually passed high school english hard as it may be to imagine the story doesnt have to be stupid just because its based upon a comic book,fantasy
i can only assume all the high ratings are coming from the studios to bump up the average and get people into the cinematheres nothing particularly good about this movie momoa is a brilliant bit of casting but beyond that its a mess of over the top and unrealistic cgi terrible plot and storyline never ending cliches zero emotional investment bland character developmentdont get me started on the underwater lava that doesnt affect the water,fantasy
the movie had good visuals if you consider cgi overkill visuals now aside from the visuals that everyone seems to like the movie had exactly 2 good scenes the rest of it is incredibly boring and predictable the script is beyond bad it was horrific the only thing worse than the script was the horrendous acting 90 of the movie is actors with poker face the story was portrayed in the most naive way possible and the story telling was horrible also there were some logical errors but i wont try to bring logic in a superhero movie even though when i say logical i mean that universes logic all in all watch it if you really love cgi otherwise avoid at all costs,fantasy
i was inveigled into going to this by the extraordinary incomprehensible 4 stars and since there was little else fun to go and see stupidly i gave in and paid my dues it is unabashedly cheap rubbish regurgitated dialogue overuse of that appalling word awesome faintingly poor acting almost dizzying and ridiculous cgi  apart from one or two landscapes  heavy noise to distract any rational thought in the viewer and really i should have left before i did  we both did even my fellow cinema loving brother had to swallow and admit excrutiating defeat,fantasy
the movie was bad i will just be blunt bad the acting was wooden the jokes were weak the romance was contrived and the plot was terrible there were some things that could have been forgiven maybe except that every single plot point was done better by a better movieall that said there was one moment  a shining moment  that i became angry for the exact opposite reason it was better than the movie deserved cutting to the chase there was a shot  a glorious shot  where the composition and foley and everything came together for a fantastic and beautiful moment that was beyond the movie that contained it thats why i give it a threeall in all just skip it,fantasy
did they just make it 25 hours for the hell of it or are you really supposed to enjoy it,fantasy
the movie could have been a lot more interesting by addind a more esotericmystic plot around the seas and atlantis mysteriesmoreover everytime they were out of ideas for their poor plot they put an explosion to create a plot twist at least 45 and everytime in the same contextthe music was sooo unadapted like who wants to listen pitbull while watching the idea and the universe is great but the movie is lame,fantasy
the acting was horrible and the story toogreat graphics thobut please dont make a second movieand i cant understand how some people saying its the best dc movie i guess they didnt watch nolans dark knight trilogytheyre butchering dc movies,fantasy
okay graphics were good but you cant make a movie based on graphics alonethe repetitive face close ups with supposedly impactful one liners could be an snl skittoo many slow motion scenescheesy linesat times felt like a power rangers moviesharks with fricking laser beams attached to their fricking headsat one point turned into the 5th elementmamoa was made to look exactly like khal drogo in one scene on the boat lolcraaaab people and godzilla in the hobbit battle of five armies mishmashdc you had struck gold with the dark knight what happened you used to be so cool,fantasy
i m feeling very nostalgic about the old movies where there was a scriptir good castinglets be honestyes momoa doesnt need makeup for this roleand yes he looks like he was born in the seabut lets be realall the movie was flat with colorful effects that maybe kids would likeadultsnot so muchbe aware this movie shouldnt be chargedat least they could pay us to watch theres also a very flat villain blackmanta very forgetableso much that i already forgot if he died or notim also very sad for nicole kidmanthis movie should have not be on her list me moviespowerful movies and then thisin conclusion i can really say that no matter how much you love the comicsthis movie will try to dry you slowly with a very long death,fantasy
this movie sucked big time story is rushed lines are cheesy and directing is poor i cant believe this has so many good reviews,fantasy
well it was ok it was on far too long i wasnt keen on the corny zoom ins of faces thought it was over dramatic plenty of action and of course jason was a delight wouldnt say it was the best film ive seen,fantasy
very good special effects but thats allin conclusion its a very boring film the story is very predictable it has no suspense,fantasy
who is paying all these people to give this rubbish a good review w cheesey cardboard nonsense without a hint of anything original i felt sorry for the poor mans scarlet johansson lookalike stay at home and poke your own eyes out for more fun really what a con,fantasy
poorly written one liners that fell flatdont see it,fantasy
ive been a superhero comics fan my whole life so i was extremely excited at the idea of having a legitimate movie of his own less so that it would be in the lowquality context of the dceufirst off momoa was a great casting choice for the man himself he has the energy and looks to actually make a lesser superhero very charismatic nonetheless the problem comes with almost everything else the other members of the cast have nothing interesting to give their characters not even the queen herself nicole kidman and the plot is just a mess its a fun mess but a mess still what i mean is that has an interesting mythos but also a limited one the authors managed to stuff the plot with orm manta the war between land and sea the trial of the trident and the trench a newer and awesome addition to the canon of recent years now this has consequences the story makes no sense of course but this has to be taken into account when watching a superhero flick a dc superhero flick rather the story is so absurd its fun and funny i found myself laughing at some of the most bombastic andor cliche scenes but this is not necessarily a bad thing last but not least this makes it incredibly hard for a sequel to happen i know dc is already considering throwing away the whole project and im honestly happy with that but the team couldve focused on fewer plot points delivering a sharper shorter film instead of burning every cartridge with a long and messy one,fantasy
i have been a defender of the darker dc universe films while not as popular nor generally as good as their marvel counterparts they all do have their good points  until now is not a very good film and i could really only come up with 1 good point  jason momoa as some are calling him the next rock and he certainly has the physique the screen presence and the charm to pull this off this movie almost worked because of momoas presence on the screenalmostdirector james wan furious 7 the conjuring certainly had the chops to direct a film like this unfortunately i found his direction to be choppy what i mean by that is that this film never really settled into a good flow it cut back and forth  both in content and in tone  to such an extent that i the moviegoer could never settle back into my seat and enjoy the ride im sure mr wan would call this movie a rollercoaster ride but if it is it is an old wooden rickety roller coaster jarring the riders as they goas for the cast they are fine from patrick wilson to amber heard to willem dafoe to dolph lundgren to good ol nicole kidman they all do decent professional jobs with what they are given but what they are given is weak and disjointedi would like to point out yahya abdulmateen as the subvillain of this piece black manta this is the most incompetent supervillain in any super hero movie to date his black manta was there obviously to give someone to beat and he beats himagainand againand againall i wanted to do was beat feet out of the theaterletter grade c for momoas efforts5 stars out of 10 and you can take that to the bankofmarquis,fantasy
id love to rate this higher but a 5 is my honest opinion people rating it 8 or higher are either being paid to do so or are such haters of marvel that theyre trying to balance the tides see what i did there i made a pun that was smarter than any of the forced humor in this filmsome positives the visuals were stunning at times jason looks good while shirtless for the ladiesthe badacting and cringe worthy dialogue story is weak and predictable spoiler alert they said his mom is dead so frequently throughout the first half of the movie it was obvious they were over compensating that she was alive overly cgi did they have any actual sets or filming locations the score was so cheesy whenever something evil was revealed the music actually went dun dun daago see it if youre a fan but be prepared to turn your brain off and munch some popcorn or scarf down some pretzel bites with nacho cheese you gotta eat them fast because thats a lot of carbs and your body will fight you if you take them too slow,fantasy
i thought it would never end it reminded me of a story someone is just making up as they go every time you think its got to be coming to and end it doesnt,fantasy
i saw on christmas day and it basically lived up to my expectationsalmost i was not impressed with the cgi at all so im not sure why everyone is talking about how great the special effects were i expected the corny cliches which i didnt mind but it was a lot of scenes where the music playing didnt really match what was going on im not sure if that bothers anyone else but i hate it some of the scenes also felt a little forced specifically all the ones that included the black mantis i would say check out this movie because their is nothing else to see in the theater right now i know there is going to be an 2 and i will probably watch it just not in the theater,fantasy
film was full of everything action comedy love background story and beauty loved it so much definitely revitalized dc movies franchise new favorite superhero movie,fantasy
the movie has spectacular special effects and cinematography but the storyline is so wooly and basic and the acting is rather superficial and lazy got bored,fantasy
very cheesy and cliches during the whole movie good visuals though after marvel too over the world you realise this is a few lightyears behind overall pretty average dont believe the 1010 reviewsstill worth watching even only for the visual aspects,fantasy
i was extremely surprised on how well the story was put together great action must see movie on the big screen,fantasy
ill keep this short and sweet after a lot of initial doubt im just back from the film itself and omfg it was brilliant decently acted by all despite the slightly clunky script in places it was visually stunning and for the most part the cgi was pretty darn good it was just so much fun i was totally engrossed from beginning to end,fantasy
it was okay not amazing not horrible i really want dc to get back on its feet and i was hoping would get it there but honestly i still feel like the franchise is in limbo the move is visually stunning the colors are incredibly saturatedthe camera work was really nice the cgi was well done however the writing was often cliched and cheesy jokes fell flat for mewhich happens in most movies there was no money left in the budget for amber heards wig and last but most importantly it had a horrible score my god they had a cover of africa by toto sung by pitbull why the score wasnt background it was heavy handed and brought me out of the movie often very similar to the newest fast and furious movies obviously the score works at making moments feel badass and fails at every other emotion all this aside the movie is simple dont go on there expecting anything particularly poignant if you dont think too hard you can just enjoy it,fantasy
while i enjoy all superhero movies ive always thought that the marvel films were better but is the best dc movie yet and on the same level as marveleverything about this movie is fantastic jason mamoa was excellent as aqauman and i cant imagine another actor in the role doing as good a job as him the movie had the perfect balance of great action humor drama and emotion the special effects looked amazing the only complaint i really have is that i thought it was a bit too long and could have been a bit shorteroverall this is easily the best dc movie yet and one of the best superhero movies of the year i think its a good sign that dc movies will soon be on the same level as marvel,fantasy
i dont know where to begin but first id like to praise james wan for directing this movie it is seems more colorful and brighter than any other dc movies jason mamoa succeed in taking the role and all this movie brings happiness to the audience thru all steps in the journey,fantasy
just enjoy the movie youll love it first of all the fight scenes were entertaining there wasnt much chit chat and the story moves at a fast pace although i would prefer more emphasis of his sincerity and some really epic background music when he pulls the trident off king atlan but nevertheless it was a good feel when he eventually did so the kings amor was comic like i loved it and the way ocean master and fought at the final scene was very well animated the poses the moves and the choreography overall i enjoyed the movie very much,fantasy
my family and i loved it so much we went to see it a second time ,fantasy
 is a superhero film that might have a messy story and some corny dialogue but because the visuals are really mindblowing the acting especially from jason momoa and amber heard is outstanding most characters except black manta are well developed and portrayed and the fighting scenes are unique the movie is a fun spectacle that serves as a great time at the theaters,fantasy
theyve finally done it dc has embraced the cheese and abandoned their attempts to make superhero movies with both the dark serious atmosphere of the dark knight trilogy and the light comedy of marvel movies it didnt work with batman vs superman and it certainly didnt work with suicide squad but they came much closer with wonder womanwhat we have here is a movie which doesnt try to be grounded and gloomy like before yet doesnt aim to be clever is proud of its corniness with all the lame jokes unexplained phenomena do none of the underwater folks need gills and impressively epic deep sea battles this last part is where the film soars i have seen few movies with such a beautiful and grand scale of action that works in spite of its flaws there are hordes of creative ocean monsters ancient and colossal predators lovecraftian horrors and jawdropping sceneries which make the boring grayscale landscape of justice league almost forgivableby no means is this a perfect movie you can expect the usual plot holes and details that dont make much sense there is little emotional connection due to pacing during dialogue that at times feels choppy and secondhanded the characters are fun and refreshing but mostly predictable and except for a couple onedimensional the performances are good but nobody in the cast will be expecting nominations during awards season i would point to both jason momoa and patrick wilson as having the most interesting chemistry simply because of their obviously clashing personalities nicole kidman had some bright scenes with real life in them willem dafoe seemed suppressed in his role in general most of the other characters were just okay one of the main villains manta in all his hightech glory is afforded a brief halfassed origin story to make him more relatablebut in spite of this seeks to be fun and it does a much better job than any of dceus previous endeavors the change in scenery is even more perplexing than the first half of wonderwoman there are so many intricatelydesigned creatures and characters that im shocked the films budget wasnt significantly higher also importantly jason momoa plays a hero who just doesnt really care about behaving like one which works  at least until a certain very specific turning point in the film after the first halfhour or so we are shown scene after scene of gorgeous visuals and battles to rival the most ambitious marvel projects it is a comic book movie after allthere are some notsosubtle critiques on mankinds treatment of the environment and though its a good message it doesnt strive to go much deeper than humans bad but not all bad dont see to have your life changed but if you want an ultrafun time at the movies with some significant progress in setting buy yourself a ticket6510,fantasy
i absoloutley indulged in this movie as it was probably the most entertaining and fun movie of all 2018 as i watched this in 2019 this is definately the highlight of my year so farbeginningthe story was amazing especially with beginning as both nicole kidman and temuera morrison completely dive into the role and put in there all as you can feel the love and connection they have in such a limited amount of screen time because of this they did great with what time they had to make it believable on screen nicole kidman completey kicked ass in this movie and honestly didnt expect any of the amazing fight chreography from her and was really impressed and overwhelmedthe storythe story was really good with some amazing writing and some unique and imaginative world building especially for when we are entering the city of atlantis and seeing the amazing under sea world it really reminded me of avatar with the overall designsi really enjoyed the feud and rivalry both arthur and king norm have for one of another but i wished that there was some brotherly love like we have with our marvel characters loki and thor but for reasons that are brought up i can see why james wan didnt go in that direction i think that patrick wilson didnt a phenominal job as king norm i didnt realise it was him from the trailers so seeing that he finally got a big role since watchmen as owl man for me is awesomethird actthe third act is the most insane thing weve had for a battle since man of steel in the dceu in my opinion as it was a chaotic suspenseful and visually stunning the kiss both mera and arthur had in the third act was kind of a yeah finally moment as you can feel they have feelings for one another throughout the film and even in justice league so for them to drag it out and then do that was a cool moment amber heard did a phenominal job as mera and really felt like a 3 dimensions character instead of an actress doing a role everyone did awesomeoverallthe film was visually stunning and the entire cast did a phenominal job how james wan and the design team made iconic yellow and green suit look great in a live action film ill never understand perfect story perfect cast perfect visuals perfect writing and perfect direction,fantasy
i enjoyed seeing james wans latest the 2018 liveaction film adaptation of the famed dc comics character tells a story thats actually quite similar to the legend of king arthur and revolves around halfhumanhalfatlantean arthur curry jason momoa becoming in order to prevent war between the underwater kingdom of atlantis and the human world is much different from james wans previous films  of course saw the film especially in its underwater sequences looks fantastic and is beautiful to look at but thats really all i got out of it im not a fan of and perhaps if i was i probably would have enjoyed it a lot more its really no different from many other bigbudget superhero films of late especially those produced by rival marvel but i went with my father who really wanted to see it and he paid for our tickets  since i paid when we went to go see spiderman into the spiderverse 2018 a few days ago710,fantasy
its really entertaining and incredibly beautifuli dont look that serious at this movie not too sure why but probably because of past dc movies,fantasy
 is a mix of typical hero films plots and predictable issues but does it work definetly yes the result of that mix is a very entertaining adventure  superhero moviealthough the movie plot is not precisely deep it is not necessary the movie brings what it promises fun and entertainment becoming a perfect movie for holidaysit seems that dc has found an anchor in jason momoa who plays an unique an honest character also the change to ilm for dc proves to be a good decission because the movie is visually stunning and the cgi and special effects are incredibleis this movie a redemption for dceu i think not but it could be a very good first step of a quality increasing path for it i hope responsibles for dceu could find in this title inspiration to bring us better and better movies of dc iconic characters,fantasy
despite a second part a bit disappointing and boringly predictable this is a good movie for sure one of the dc best if not the best even if this comparison could be meaningless considering the other dc movies,fantasy
for once i was impressed with dc on last year on justice league i was a bit disappointed but i think dc is on the right path now,fantasy
do not go into this movie expecting some big allegory or mirror on society its not that this movie is pure and unapologetic entertainment and i love it dont get me wrong deeper more artistic movies are fantastic but not every movie has to be one of those some just need to be entertaining and take you on an action packed journey sell you some escapism and just be funthis movie was cheesy yes but a good cheese the brie cheese of superhero movies it made me laugh cry gasp and loose my freaking mind honestly its one of the best movies ive ever seen in terms of pure entertainment value i know i keep repeating that but here is no other way to describe itjason mamoa is engaging and fun but also gave some depth not to mention absolutely stunning amber herds mera was a great character and was an absolute doer and not clich at all the love stories werent forced and one was particularly beautiful also for the dc and comic book nerds like me out there so many fun little easter eggs to the comics and animated movies so that was just icing on the cakei genuinely cant wait to watch this movie again and again,fantasy
its overthetop its full of superhero movie tropes because its a comicbookey movie brought to life about one of the most overthetop superheroes out there and im sure thats exactly what the creators were trying for which is why it gets a perfect 10to be clear has been my favorite superhero since i was a teenager when i heard about this movie i was both excited and nervouswb has a bit of a shaky reputation when it comes to dc movies late 90s batman green lantern etc so i dont think my worries were unfoundedfrom the outset i was sucked in visuals are great lots of cgi but a lot of things happen underwater what do you expect and acting is solid although there are some disagreements with some versions of arthur currys backstory this brings a good flavor to the canon curry flavor pun very much intendedtakeaway points visuals are great story is interesting and moves along at a good pace editing keeps things feeling natural and acting helps characters come to life very high score is very deserved even if isnt your drink of choice,fantasy
aquamen is definitely not masterpiece but it is not so bad like critics said generally this film is too long and too banal it is good film like popcorn movie and once you can watch it overall it has problems but if you are not picky this movie will be interesting for you,fantasy
this was a great dc film right up there with wonder women 1 part i didnt think was necessary was manta i felt that he was an unneeded villain or they could have just had a clip in the end not sprinkled thru out the whole movie didnt make sense to me but overall great,fantasy
best movie with superheroscongratulation for actorsamazing joball you want for that type of movie is heresomeone says that movie is flat and dont have plot twistpffandis so good plot twist dont neccesarrily or athere thinkscome on manyou have actionfungood storymotivationbest effectsso smarts heads who want a deep narrative story go fck yourselfs with the godfather etc,fantasy
i can sum up the movie in two words wet thorspoilers below1 both had brother issues2 both were told that their parent was dead3 both had an older mentor guiding them4 both had issues accepting their responsibilities5 both movies had reveal scenes with their quintessential look after a major fight scene prior to facing their brotheri could continue but the point is made,fantasy
when i heard they were making an movie i rolled my eyes after seeing the abomination that was justice league and batman vs superman i had low expectations i was so wrong once i saw the preview i had a little hope but it looked like a black panther ripoff i went in ready to be disappointed and came out blown away james wan did excellent on this film i never thought i would say i liked an film but i did the acting was great and there were funny moments the fight scenes were so much more different than i had prevuiously seen in any movie the visuals were perfect and i was in love black manta proved to be an awesome villain despite looking very funny orm or oceanmaster turned out to be an awesome villain as well the ending scene is what got me when arthur and orm jumped up on the ship and the slowmo was used i actually muttered whoa there were surpringly a couple scenes like that the fight in italy when mera and arthur dived into the reaf and it gave us the beautiful underwater shot of them getting swarmed by those creatures i was in awe beautiful and worthy of 10,fantasy
im a huge fan of marvel and i always thought that dcs superhero movies suck dont get me wrong but justice league and batman vs superman super boringwonder woman was still okay but totally change my opinion towards dc thanks to james wannot going to describe much but if you havent watched it yet please do,fantasy
not since the dark knight have i seen a dc movie in theaters that i would want to see in theaters again you can tell dc is doing things differently with they are not afraid to use the fantastical elements of comicswhat that means is instead of a dark gritty rooted in reality movie we have a colorful vibrant other world under the sea movie it is unique from other movies in its style and story elements while still maintaining familiar superhero elementshaving said that i personally found the movie quite predictable perhaps it is the way the movie plays out very similar to many video games i have played what i mean is that the movie while quite good feels like it is made based off a video game story campaignmany scenes of dialog end with sudden violence the main character is repeatedly told that they have only one path they can make without the world ending even a kind of tutorial scene and well established powersit really felt like it was written by a video game story designer but in a good way i hope dc can remember what worked in in future dc movies,fantasy
one thing pixar should have taught anyone making movies is that the story comes first without characters and situations that engage an audience without screenwriters who can craft meaningful dialogue all the cgi in the universe cant save a movie actors that can make us believe they are the characters they portray and directors and film editors that shape a film into a meaningful whole can make a good story into a memorable experience has none of those things it has the cgi but unless you have the critical capacity of a 10year old that isnt nearly enough this isnt a movie its just a bunch of poorly written badly acted set pieces that look good but leave an audience wanting so much morefor awhile i thought maybe this was going for the pacific rim effectlaughably over the top but no its just a mess of a movie a waste of money and time the dialogue is laughable the story is cliched silly and dullwitted and the acting is about at the level of a power rangers episode save the trouble of finding out for yourself and dont be fooled by any of these 1010 reviews both of our sons 17  20 nearly fell asleep watching this and my wife did dc has a long way to go before they can equal marvel,fantasy
this film was brilliant and really felt like a comic book movie more than any film has in a while and also had a brilliant adventure and action sequences throughout i thought the foreshadowing and the way that it was presented was done well and had me gripped from beginning to endthis is one of the best superhero movies dc have done in a while and i hope they keep this up,fantasy
james wan has done it he has created a superhero movie with as much heart and soul as the original superman is visually beautiful both in storytelling and effects this and wonder woman are perfect blueprints for hollywood to follow this is how you make movies this is what going to the movies is all about this is what defines cinematic masterpiece and this movie will join the archives of classic just a phenomenal film loaded with creative wonder and soul sets the standard very high,fantasy
 is a good super hero and blockbuster movie it is worth to see it in theatre although it has something original we saw lots of cliches and similarities with other super hero characters and movies what did it first is creating a world under water and they did it alright cgis are really great i liked it but sometimes you can easily figure out it is a visual effect because editors have to use these effects every time and thats the hard part of the job even so this movie has the best cgis in any dc movie for me also has a great action italy fight submarine fight big battle in atlantis casting is great too momoa and heard did a wonderful job on this project but generally characters doesnt have tough motivations especially king orm he is not a so intense villian on the other hand film is so long i think it could be better if it would be 15 minutes shorter another great thing did it great is connection of opening and final sequences it was enjoyable,fantasy
ive said before that the difference between marvel and dc is that marvel is humans becoming gods and dc is gods becoming humans if there was a character from dc that embodies this type at least on earth that would be not only is he the king of atlantis but like a lot of people within the dc universe he already has godlike powers his story seems more classical then superman or batman one in which he may have grown up amongst humans only to find that his connection to the sea makes him a king tell me this doesnt sound like something that fits along with homers odyssey had already been featured in batman v superman dawn of justice and justice league but he had never gotten his own movie come to think of it hes a character that hasnt been seen within a live action given how expansive the comic books have shown atlantis and the majority of his powers i cant imagine how this guy would have been portrayed without computer effects it almost seemed that the dc universe was doomed after the negative reception to justice league lets see how things have improved in the standalone movieas shown through a flashback a lighthouse keeper thomas finds the queen of atlantis atlanna played by nicole kidman washed up on shore the two fall in love and have a child arthur when atlantis comes looking for them atlanna returns to the sea leaving thomos to care for his son cut to years later when arthur played by jason mamoa has gained reputation as an who stops pirates on the high seas after coming home one day hes approached by mera played by amber heard who asks that he return to atlantis to dethrone his stepbrother orm played by patrick wilson who is ruthless and wants to become ocean master of all kingdoms arthur declines but agrees to accompany her to find his mothers tridentfrom here arthur and mera return to atlantis meeting with his old teacher and a confidant of orm nuidis played by william dafoe while getting information their ambushed and orm attempts to fight him but they escape traveling to the sahara and sicily they figure out where the trident is but the battle rages on as orm wants to declare war on the surface world and arthur has to fulfill his destiny as the to stop his brother from becoming ocean masterfor the most part is the movie that warner brothers had needed to make in order to compete with disneys marvel brand is it a perfect comic book movie no but it was a lot more entertaining then i expected it to be director james wan the conjuring fast 7 seems to have thrown out the brooding darkness from the previous movies and embraced the more fantasy elements of the dc universe is not a bad movie to do that with given that the majority of the story is set underwater and the kingdom of atlantisenvironment is one thing but its all for nothing if the characters arent interesting the good news is that jason mamoa is not only charismatic but hes also a welcome change to the typical all american or strong women we see hes more like the former jock from high school whose at least nice and willing to make a friend mamoa not only fits in well with his position as the son of a lighthouse keeper but has a noble pose giving him more of a royalty ambiance then i felt with chadwick boseman from black pantherhis journey is also interesting as the goal is not only simple but is genuinely fun when we see him in sicaly fighting hightech pirates im invested when hes in atlantis talking to his brother i want to see where things so when arthur has to fight im curious to see how the movie will incorporate the various elements of the ocean most of it is played out well though if i had a problem its that the movie is a tad too long without giving anything away theres a second villain they could have cut as the story is mainly setting him up for a sequel not to mention there are exposition bits of dialogue that could have been shortenedill give this eight comics out of ten its crazy to think that while superman and batman were not done well its wonder woman and this that are the better movies within warner brothers this is likely to help those whove been dissatisfied with the previous dc movies all i can say is that does not blow the man down go check it out,fantasy
the film can be mistaken in some points but the mistakes do not take the brightness of the film so much that it was not perfect because of some mistakes which i will not speak about here but spoilers but the film is wonderful very faithful to the comics and the characters with a lot of charisma i loved everyonethe action scenes are spectacular i was hypnotized besides the graphic beauty that is this film undoubtedly is well wronged seen the medium criticism in some sites but remains one of the best films of the year,fantasy
alright first things first atlantis is the most beautiful place in movie history you wont be disappointed when you see atlantis i can make a whole essay on why atlantis is the most spectacular setting in movie history the movie was good and all of the actors were really good at playing their characters the movie keeps you excited the whole entire time honestly this movie is great,fantasy
all i have to say for this movie is just the world briliant,fantasy
wasnt sure what to expect but came away more than happy i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this film and it has to be my fav marvel movie yet go see it,fantasy
must watch movie loved vfx underwater action soundeffects were stunning,fantasy
this movie is a home run a huge step up in every way compared to the last several dc universe movies,fantasy
it remembered me guardians of galaxy all the time not for the fun but for the consistence on the plot and special effects the movie is not a reference on the comedy gender and i didnt laugh most of the jokes but it doesnt need to be that funny rightdc had a hard job to make a good film out of a not so respected horoe speaking for myself i didnt know much of just the basics that everybody knows and it worked very wellthe cast is really good there wouldnt be any other main actor as good as jason to play the role and james wan managed to make one of the best super heroe movies of the year for me only behind avengers also think this might the best movie from dc maybe behind justice league,fantasy
most beautiful movie of dc all time ever after dark knightfantastic,fantasy
i was sceptical about this movie after seeing the trailer somehow they accomplished making the movie look corny with cringe worthy graphics but when you see the way it all plays out in the movie wow i am still stunned at how incredible and realistic the graphics are at 15 hours i was thankful the movie still had time left as i didnt want it to be over one of the best movies ive seen in 2018 you must see it,fantasy
james wan did a very great job the cgi is very cool and momoa is very cool too ,fantasy
i am a diehard marvel fan but can confirm that if dc will create movies like this i will not miss a single dc movie this movie is awesome and lot better than the original comic too,fantasy
i am a hard core batman fan so i can call myself a dc fan also well after the dceu started i was excited that it can give a neck to neck competition to marvel but that never happenedmarvel always got good critical reviews as well as phenomenal box office numbers and yes apart from man of steel the other consecutive movies bvs or jl they both were not upto the mark wonder woman was a good movie thoughbecause of these dissappointments i was not excited for i thought this will also be added to the list of the above movies i mentioned but i was proven wrong  how did i forgot that the director of this movie is none other than mr james wan who made the conjuring and furious 7 but everything aside james wan yet again proved his mettle and this movie is a sure shot blockbusterdc has a bad repo for not giving much freedom to its directors and thats why its movies become dissapointments but as wan claimed that he was given full freedom in making we can ourselves see the results of it and i hope that dc continues this trend in its future movies alsoback to the movie lets talk about pros and conspros 1 wans direction is fantastic2 action director who has designed the action deserves a praise3 vfx team also deserves a praise a film like this is quite a difficult task to do but still these guys have done it4 adding emotions in a proper proportion adds a character development aspect which we missed in previous dceu movies though they could have shown more emotional attachment of queen of atlanta and ocean master5 performances by all the actors are fantastic6 art director also deserves a praisecons1 film gets boring in between especially in italy scenes2 if character development of black manta and ocean master could have been done a bit well then it could have been more amazingmy rating is 810,fantasy
well they managed to make cooli dont say that lightly either the superhero with the oddson worst reputation of all has been redeemed by a talented leading man and a sound director james wans work with this script managed to blend high action character development and tremendous visuals with a smattering of utter ridiculousness for good measurejason momoa is the star but amber heard cannot be overlooked as her character is the one that drives the plot and not as the love interest wan did his homework and ensured that mera was more than eye candy or a damsel in distress she is a buttkicker and more intuitive than arthur is for most of the moviearthur is done consistently with what we got of him in justice league but fleshed out more and momoa is up to the challenge of doing more with a guy who to this point had been a hard drinking nobody who could fire off the occasional wisecrack the backstory he is given is less tragic than many other superheroes tend to get complete with one guaranteed living parent kind of an odd fact in this genrepatrick wilson is definitely committed as the wouldbe ocean master and brings a hammy gravitas to the role as though he understands how ridiculous he is and plays it up at every opportunity this should make him cheesy but instead it makes him more distasteful adding to the strength of the performanceblack manta is another good choice and his part in the film is helpful at moving the plot along and bringing more action his anger and unfettered rage for revenge makes him a good gritty villain to counterbalance the othersthe action is fantastic and the scale on which it is done in many scenes is great but at no point do you lose track of arthur or mera as they get through it alllike wonder woman this is an example of what the dceu can be when it is given to directors and writers who are of quality and theres less zack snyder,fantasy
this movie was perfect it was right up there with avatar there were all kinds of people all ages in this theatre everyone was so engaged this was really good every time i see a review on rotten tomatoes they are usually wrong as with this one in my opinionall items were on spotcastcinematographyvisualsstoryplotwritingdirectingaction scenesvillains,fantasy
good movie great storyline good special effect and a lot of action,fantasy
remember to watch it in imax the action the cinematography music scoring story telling everythings so perfectly crafted that i cant describe them in words,fantasy
the dc universe has been doing pushups in the shadows while marvel boasted in the spotlight as a marvel fanboy i am ecstatic to see that dc has officially entered the competition by coming out swinging with if you are skeptical as to whether or not you will like this film please just watch the first few scenes maintains masterful storytelling and gripping action throughout the entirety of its 25hour runtime with the exception of the last 15 minutes cinematographer don burgess allowed the 160milliondollar budget to work at its full potential facilitating jawdropping fight scenes and making the audience feel the power behind the strikes i have high hopes for quality dc films in the future,fantasy
  marvel all new visual experience must watch film amazing directon nd amazing vfx,fantasy
movie is solid 85 good character development there is a pace to the story and it builts up nicely for the first time i would say i for one liked both the protagonist and the antagonist partially bias to patrick wilson by the end of it you really are cheering for the his costume is on point amber is a total babe and ofcourse the eye candy her character requires her to be surprisingly nicole kidman has a small screen time but her character is quite awesome,fantasy
the visuals in imax 3d is like nothing youve literally seen before the score was epic the beginning was iconic as it literally picks up where the syndercut of justice league left off of just like jason momoa said seeing queen atlanna laying down unconscious was so emotionalthe whole movie kept an consistent flowthe laughter in the movie was not overused like mcu the villains king ormocean master  black manta have a relatable background to why they are mad at arthur which has a parallel to moswith zod having a reasonable reason to be mad at superman,fantasy
dc is on a rebound ww now well realized world great special effects lots of fun,fantasy
i really liked man of steel i enjoyed batman v superman wonder woman was great and justice league was good butit wasnt what it could have been is freaking awesome this is a complete 360 for the dcu wow dcu needs to keep going with movies like this awesome highly recommend great ride and leaves you wanting more,fantasy
finally dc got it rightthe story was rich the characters were three dimensional and believable the action was nonstop and the special effects were second to none the eye candy almost made me go into a diabetic coma seriously those of you who are planning to see it when it comes to netflix or hulu you will be cheating yourself treat yourself to the cinema scope experience itll be worth it,fantasy
really 15 films in one from indiana jones to star wars,fantasy
marvel got thor ragnorock and dc got ignore critics and treat urself to this amazing ocean world and stylized fight scenes,fantasy
at last a dcu movie that draws upon universe canon and lays the groundwork for future development as well as wonder woman did maybe better well written excellently acted awesome special effects lots of fun which is its main purpose judge for yourself,fantasy
this was a great movie i was entertained from start to finish the only criticism i would have is the song that they play to end movie is just too cutesy for my taste for a movie like this it should have been a bit rougher in tone perhaps a good rock song,fantasy
dont get me wrongsuper fun movie and enjoyable from beginning to end for the most part mamoa owns the role and water world effects were top notchthat being said the script was a little blah and the effects were a little long in the tooth the film seemed to drag a bit as well with that while desert sequencemy biggest peeve is that a lot of the fight sequences felt like i was watching mighty morphin power rangers both their weapons and costumes it was straight up mmpw and i dont mean the movie which actually wasnt horriblei mean the tv series black manta cmon dudethat scene was total throwaway i really thought you were going to bring down a demigod with your supped up scuba gear good try broanyway fun movie but it stilll lags behind wonder woman and pretty much every dc movie except maybe venombut that was its own disaster,fantasy
i was kind of skeptical coming into this movie at first mainly because of justice league jl was a huge flop imo as it was simply rushed and there was simply no character growth at all besides wonder woman batman  supes i had absolutely no inkling or any form of connections to the other heroesso lo and behold fast forward a year later and the trailer for aquamam came out i have to admit the trailer was very intriguing but even then i was kind of doubtful if could even entertain me with a decent plot or even some halfsolid action sequences my expectations were totally shatteredthe cast was great jason momoa killed it as he brought aquman to life perfectly with his outgoing and rambunctious personality and physically he nailed it as well amber heard as mera was perfect too as she displays a sense of pride and strength that we are all too familiar with the mera in the comic book universe patrick wilson as king orm was convincing as well and he truly made me dislike him from the moment he appears the supporting case nicole kidman  william dafoe was solid too and even the antagonists were considerably interesting too this is what truly set apart from jl there is a proper cause and has a legitimate underdog journey to obtain the throneoverall i think all dc fans and any average moviegoer should go watch this the cgi isnt bad at all and james wan has perfects cuts and edits so not a single scene feels to dragged out the action scenes are all very neatly done and u can feel a surge of adrenaline pumping through you when the musical score hits during battle scenesmost importantly though there is an actual plot that you can relate to and you can submerge yourself in the absolutely dreamy and surreal world of atlantis while enjoying this roller coaster of a moviei am definitely hoping for a sequel and i hope the dceu can continue building on the success of this movie,fantasy
great action from start to finish this movie is action pack with the storyline being told as the movie goes on beautiful cgi in the world of atlantis great movie and i give it 9 out of 10,fantasy
okay so its not really oscar worthy but if you want to see a movie that is a lot of fun and visually stunning go seegreat cast jason m is so cool and then they threw in william dafoe and nicole kidman toothe best popcorn movie around,fantasy
 is right now the best dc movie so fari was speechless after the movie and had chills trough the entire filmthe story was good not perfect but better than the black panther sh looks 1000 times better than the marvel or dc films i sawgo and see the film in imax it looks incrediblesorry for my bad english im from germany,fantasy
aqua man is just beautiful in its visuals would be amazing in 3d it has great action sequences story kind jumps from certain places at times when characters or places are introduced felt anticlimactic in way especially the war battle wish black manta has more screen time my only gripe about is the intro on how aqua man was born wish they cut that scene out seems dull especially adding love story did not work for melove the visuals and cinematography story was okay but i still like the the dark knight more than this one because their is meaning behind it and doesnt have that magical feeling its okay but its amazingly beautiful in its visuals hands down,fantasy
i really wanted to love this movie i did but too many clichs too many scenes that reminded me of other scenes in other movies it became a game of name that movie with my nephews and i and a totally predictable plot basically ruined it for me it was beautiful to look at especially jason momoa but the totally 80s music that worked in thor but threw me off hereso unfortunately i was sadly disappointed by this installment,fantasy
its the best dceu film in this decadego and enjoy the moviefun overloadedvisuals are great  for this it would get an oscar,fantasy
i find many action scenes in comicbook movies too short or too long with not enough drama this movie has good balance of showing strength of with just the right amount of number and length of action scenes the visuals are really stunning and really well donei rolled my eyes on stupid jokes and this is probably the only downside of this movie its like theyre there to compete with marvelwhateverfor me nolans batmans were the movies made more for adults this one is more for children although older gen that like comicbooks will be pleased910 for cgi and 7510 for movie in whole,fantasy
one of the best dc movies to date had some cliche lines but besides that it has a great story fantastic cgi and visuals highly recommend as a date or family night movie,fantasy
thrill ride to the extreme never a dull moment as it moves quickly and without long winded character expositions that have dragged down previous dc films the underwater visuals are the gold standard here much like avatar did eons ago and the action is just as breathtaking most of the dialogue was uninspired hero encouragement like lesser with great power comes great responsibility and without the same emotional weight there are a few questionable scenesconcepts that may cause some brain cells to drown themselvesmy main complaint is the audio mixing primarily with the dialogue being way too low compared to the bgm most of the time compounding this they add an echolike effect for underwater scenes which sounds like an immersive idea but only makes the words less clear and not easily understandablebut if you see one last film this year you cant go wrong with this,fantasy
this is a very typical dc heroic story its straightforward and predictable but i really appreciated the brilliant underwater world cgi its so mysterious and fantastic the plots run a little slow and stupid in the beginning but climax and underwater battles are much compacted and excited laterin my very own opinion i dont like the because the character is arrogant sometimes yet selfabased inside because he knew himself is a half breed and the cinemagraph world also insulted him by that i have no idea why the beautiful princess would treat him differently from the beginning probably every hero has a hallo and only heroine can see as a girl i admire the beauty of mera her red hair is so charming and the texture is so fairly flowing in the water i really appreciated movie creators works by giving this effectlastly such a shame underworld killed their own kind before revenge the surface,fantasy
the visuals and the cgi is just amazing the only thing that really sucks is the script as it contains cringey dialogues and bad punchlines to jokes the chase between and black manta and the fight is good and it has the best director forthe final battle between orm and arthur is amazing but the ending of the battle is what i didnt like as i expected for orm to stab himself with the trident as arthur doesnt want to kill him overall great movie,fantasy
the visuals for this movie where amazing but the whole movie seemed exactly like black panther but under water,fantasy
disaster gave us two things a moment to react and a decision to make thats exactly what dc has executed brilliantly with after jl disasterstarting from the storyactioncastacting and visually its just so freaking awesome my god u just need to watch itanother big plus point for is that story didnt suck at all  it was really addicting and little to none plot holeseverything folds pretty smoothly with aquman originchildhood and recent event is just a real treat to watch especially the theatrical experience of this movie is just so awesome with amazing sound effect crowd reaction and if u are a big thor ragnarok fan than u must watch,fantasy
saw this movie last night and it blew my expectation right out of the water first of the movie looks stunningly some scenes even goes beyond that meanwhile others tips its toes on being too much cgigreen screen heavy but for a movie like this it doesnt matter as its ment to be a bit over the top and funthe cast did an amazing job and was really well put together i didnt know before the movie that stars like nicole kidman patrick wilson williem dafoe temuera morrison and dolph lundgren was in it so i was amazed just by that and to see dolph lundgren in a movie like this again was great jason momoa as really works played by anyone else i think it would have just felt silly this movie is action packed and fun in the same time this time around dc really made a great movie that i think the whole family really enjoyed,fantasy
the visuals in this movie are the best ever since the first star wars the action is great the cons are the movie is little dragged out jasons acting is great the oceanmaster was great and black manta as well unfortunately the movie was ruined for me the theater i saw it in with kids had horrible sound i couldnt hear the music at all so im really bummed as i was so pumped for this movie but the visuals were so stunning,fantasy
anyone rating this movie under a 5 is delusional its not a 1010 like some people have rated however its an extremely fun movie both me and my wife loved it and i would see it again,fantasy
you know its a good movie when 2 and a half hours goes by in a flash,fantasy
of all the dc movies this is the best james wan very well loaded the film contains a great visual demonstrating well the vast universe of atlantis the action scenes are good the script although clich works and leaves the story interesting jason momoa also went well the villain is no big deal but pleases i hope in a future continuation they continue on the same level,fantasy
great fight scenes good pace solid story but zero chemistry between amber and jason sadly amber brings no life to the role truly forgettable but worth seeing the movie,fantasy
for me this was a christmas feast you are enjoying it but in the end u kinda feel sick from all the food u atethere was too much stuff happeningwonder woman is still the best dc filmdef watch it it was fun for surei will still give it a 10 because of reasons i mentioned on my profile,fantasy
the cgi is amazingjames wan did a very great job ,fantasy
dc finally sets the benchmark it got the dc thing with a touch of marvels colours avatars visuals pocs sound and direction of james wan it all comes together to be the best dc movie,fantasy
it was a good filmi loved the mera charachter development and films storythe story is great and actors too i didnt like ocean master but black manta was a great villian,fantasy
being a dc fan it was tough to see the way dceu was going it had ups with man of steel and wonder woman and its low with suciede squadbut the king of atlantis stands apart from all the other dceu movies to be one of the best dc movies ever made visually rich with a great cinematographic experience and vision of james wan is a rebirth of dceuscenes are spectacular acting is at its top with this movie jason momoa as was perfect in every sense so as patrick wilson amber heard and nicole kidmanbut the reason of success of movie is a wan himself wans vision to show the world with a vibrant color is noteworthy and to be very frank deserves a nomination at most of the awards showaltogether vfx makes it so rich and exprerience in 3d makes the deep ocean and action sequence much more vibrant and richworld of dc is much more imaginative than mcu and tough to represent to show the hope of superman justice of wonder woman darkness of batman speed of flash and brilliance of cyborg gave a base on which epic megastructure of dc is possible to be madeking of oceans is here and you will definetely love it,fantasy
too much of everything too much drama too long too much of the same explosions too much scifi even for a scifiwas looking forward to this movie but just made me be like omg realy on most of the scenes,fantasy
dc need improve their movies the plotting scene is really bad it is so dissapoint totally waste my time,fantasy
i mean im sure critics will be able to pull this apart but it literally transferred me to another world like no other movie what they have pulled off here is nothing short of spectacular at the time of writing this is probably my favourite solo superhero movie it was so entertaining the visuals were like nothing else youve ever seen the story was coherent well done dc the action never stops yet doesnt get exhausting the pacing is perfect even the back in time scenes slot in well and never become dull and they are usually an annoyance of mine mera is a strong and awesome female character without them having to shove feminism down your throat kidman defoe and lungdren are superb as os wilson moama naturally and rightly steals the show  theres not much else to add really to pull off an underwater movie like waan has done here is a true feat i just hope people go and see it and havent been put off by previous offerings from dc even though i have personally liked them all if you come out of this movie not having truely enjoyed it you are either biased to a scary level or are dead insideif you want to be picky the selfie scene joke falls flat and it gets a bit busy in the end underwater battle scene but if any of that bothers you youve gone in to it with a negative attitude and looking for issues,fantasy
my opinion just like othersthank james wann  you saved dceu ,fantasy
1 story telling is jarring no origin story gives u the huffing puffing brainless muscle tattoo guy beating people up straight away2 expect audiences to identify with a tattoo muscle man with zero depth drinking beer bashing skulls right at the beginning seriously3 a horribly stereotypical movie 1 dimensional black guys villians women characters whose exposed breasts speak louder than their words this is not the 60s anymore at least they didnt do blackface4 the black villian subplot is a waste of screen time and can be removed with absolutely no effects to the movie5 problematic source material means overuse of cgi it feels more like an xbox  computer game than a movie6 insipid shallow dialog everyone is treated as a 5 year old just a step up from hulk smash7 costume design is hilarious look like star wars storm troopers or something clobbered together in 5 minutes leathery fin on nicole kidmans back like see halloween swimming costume seriouslyyou do better hell lot better than that8 unnecessary plot holes wheres the almighty bfg gifted to the black villian not used at all wasting audience time9 queen reunites with illegitimate hubby at the end so theres going to be more children running around in the future please tie up all your plot holes and prevent necessary jokes10 you remember the soundtrack of the movie inception what there is even a soundtrack totally nonexistent  insipid  uninspiring audio makes it difficult to connect to a movie already hard to begin with11 there is zero character transformation of the hero from beginning to end still the same old beer swagging tattoo bar brute than a king what he is perfect as he is what sort of an origin story is this12 the jokes are not funny bar scene joke is more of a distraction than adding value the toilet bowl face dunk is just plain crude and another plot hole so what happens he is going to spend his life in that toilet,fantasy
oh man what a waste of 25 hours im really not understanding why this piece of tosh is getting so much hype zero story nonsensical plot onedimensional characters cringeworthy dialogue horrendous production design costume design looked like they rippedoff the power rangers and the visuals werent even that great the youngification of temeura morrison and nicole kidman at the beginning of the movie was absolutely laughable mantas  actually all the costumes  looked so cheap and plasticy it reminded me of those kids costumes that you get at the dollar store momoa does his best impersonation of thor but ultimately fails to draw any laughs or garner any emotion they absolutely rippedoff every scifi fantasy concept out there mixed them together and hoped something would stick it was just a loud chaotic brash flashy lowbrow seething mess i think even sharkboy and lava girl did a way better job just give up dceu youre no match for the mcu the harder you try the worse you look,fantasy
i do not understand why there are such high ratings for this movie the dialogue is awful special effects could be much better considering the money spent on production and the storyline is nothing special,fantasy
too cheesy if you liked thor rhagnarok avoid this,fantasy
this movie absolutely blew my mind i dont even like super hero movies that much and this is the best movie ive seen all year the action scenes characters and plot were all head and shoulders above any super hero movie ive ever seen but the one thing that really stood out to me is the world that director james wan created i mean this thing is immaculate i havent been this captivated by a universe since the harry potter movies every single scene whether on land or in water is absolutely breathtaking and dont even get me started on the sea creatures for a second i felt like i was watching jurassic world underwater but for real do not sleep on this insanely epic movie and if youre a fan of 3d you have to see this in 3d youd be doing yourself a disservice if you dont,fantasy
i left this movie an hour and a half in it wouldnt suck so hard if you didnt know that this movie is trying to be really good acting is terrible and the movie jumps all over the place the visuals are stunning i will give it that but that is the only thing that is good about this disaster of a movie,fantasy
for years the man of the high seas has been over looked and not respected always trailing and falling far behind dcs big boys of superman batman and even wonder woman finally a big screen film of and much different from my memory of fish man as with jason momoas take this superhero looks more like a heavy metal weight lifting super star and the film is filled with plenty of action scenes and the cgi and special effects are plenty still aside from all of the big stuff its a good origin story of how his parents meet and how comes about and its a journey of sibling conflict and war under sea as the kingdom and water country of atlantis is at risk and along the way meraamber heard gives support as king orm is a big threat to underwater peace thru it all aquas mom atlannanicole kidman is an underwater spirit thats still present for things to stay afloat overall pretty good take and work from dc as the man of the sea finally gets movie exposure,fantasy
it started out well enough but got progressively less believable edging towards meaningless as the exciting finale approached i wondered could this possibly get any more stupid indeed it did i might have missed the end but a number of loud explosions woke me,fantasy
in 3d  i enjoyed this one to this day i think the best dc based charakter movie after men of steel,fantasy
this movie was great i highly recommend seeing it in theatres there was the right amount of humor and love in the movie with every action scene in the middle the movie wasnt entirely in cgi the producers made sure that it looked real the graphics were amazing and stunning the scenery and landscapes were in high definition with remarkable views overall a great film,fantasy
 is funny and full of great action this movie is a good start to what could be a dc revival,fantasy
thank you james wan for this movie i enjoyed every minute of this film in theater one of the best experiences of all times 1010,fantasy

call me the ocean master king orm patrick wilson the villain in james wans portentously shouts at the outset of the films climactic scene warner bross latest attempt to shift its dc brand away from the dour machoism that marked and marred such films as man of steel embraces high fantasy but for wan and screenwriters david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick and will beall this turns out to mostly mean having characters proclaim their silly comic book names as assertively as possible im black manta growls black manta yahya abdulmateen ii the films other supervillain instead of a deep detailed world what wans undersea fantasy constructs is a series of scenes often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault that seem to dare the viewer to mock the world of comics most risible superherothis defensive posture was evident in the calculated decision to cast the at once beautiful and threatening jason momoa as the man who talks to fish whose unassuming alter ego is arthur curry is introduced in the film with a fight on board a russian submarine a sequence in which momoa in closeup practically snarls directly into the camera as he hurls pirates into bulkheads thatll teach the audience to make fun ofbut theres plenty more in that will provoke unintentional laughter its less that the world presented herewith its fishhuman hybrids legendary kings and coveted tridentsis inherently funny and more that the film rushes through its story at such a breakneck pace that viewers never have a chance to settle into it to see it as a livedin universe after a while it all begins to feel arbitrary we have little time to process the functioning of waterbased laser rifles before were introduced to fish people in brightly colored togas or to a stonefaced willem defoe wearing a onesie and a topknotthe films origin story resembles that of mythological superheroes like thor and wonder woman in which a superpowered being awkwardly adjusts to an unfamiliar environment one is tempted to call a fishoutofwater story arthur is the child of queen atlanna nicole kidman part of the ruling family of the fabled underwater city atlantis and a human man temuera morrison after his mother is forced to return to atlantis arthur grows up with his father in maine isolated from the undersea kingdom that is his birthright until mera amber heard arrives on shore to convince him to return and prevent the war orm and her father nereus dolph lundgren are planning against the humans on the surface although and in standard herosjourney fashion arthur initially refuses meras call for help hes soon compelled to take up her cause after a tidal wave nearly kills his fathera bounty of cgheavy action scenes follow from handtohand combat in an underwater colosseum to a chase through a sicilian village to a fullfledged confrontation of armies on the ocean floor at its best the films underwater action with its traveling shots that zoom through crowds of fantastical marine species and past mossencrusted classical ruins are vibrant aesthetically engrossing spectacle a few shots in particular stand out for their compositional flair such as mera and arthurs climactic kiss against the chaotic backdrop of a raging undersea battle and one which frames the couple swimming toward the bottom of the frame as a horde of lovecraftian fishmonsters coalesce behind them and give pursuitat its weakest moments however the film offers a parade of oceanfloor vistas that evoke the substanceless worldbuilding of george lucass second star wars trilogy a supersaturated digital landscape of smooth surfaces and expensivelooking designs exacerbatesalmost by designsome of the worst tendencies of todays superhero movies the weightlessness of fights rendered with cg is compounded by that of fights between people suspended in water and the sexlessness of superhero movies is only emphasized by the perfunctory romance between two leads who seem to have been cast largely because they look good dripping wetthe best point of comparison for is black panther another superhero movie about a king of a forgotten realm reclaiming his throne but whereas ryan cooglers surprisingly affecting superhero film restored weight to both the choreography and the drama of the genre remains adrift so much fantasy flotsam and jetsam floating before our eyes,fantasy
lets make it clear this is the best dceu movie so far the visual is out of this world theres not really a boring scene of this movie there are some but it didnt feel like dragging theres something quite satisfying to see black manta on live action movie but even though its arguably the coolest looking dude in the movie his story is really shallow hes just there to kill idk about comic book but it seems like he shouldve i dont know a little bit more important  i dont know if this is the right word to use or not to the story also theres some kinda romance between and mera that feel forced like its kind of cringeworthy a little bit at some part other than those things its definitely very good movie the final battle felt huge and amazing is really struggling before he have the trident definitely recommended i even think this should have higher rating than ww its just my humble opinion thoughgo watch it,fantasy
watched it no matter how much dc movie has disappointed you before trust me this one was a different story its beautiful i mean the cgi wasnt on perfect scale but yeah its still beautiful you got beautiful landscape and ocean a lot of cool ship theres a lot of great statue badas creature great action scene and dinosaur hhahathe main background story from arthur was told very good with a backward forward way jason momoa really fit with arthur character the comedy scene was enough and not to much so its complete the movie in a good wayand you still can feel james style in this movie you got his twist you can still feel his jump scare sense and he even still gave you his scene youll know what i meanand i think one things that make this movie really good for me was they really show the message from what actually hapend with our sea right now god i wish we can still see a group of manta ray like that,fantasy
i would say that i wont regret to wait and watch this movie first of all i found jason momoa is completely perfect to portray as everything in this movie is making me having goosebumps the actors and actresses have given their best and really fit into their characters the story is so details like exactly what i want and the effect is superb almost couldnt find a difference between reality and cgi james wan is a very good also talented director with his amazing idea that make underwater is beyond our minds very proud with dc and warner bros to choose him to made this movie cant wait for the next surprise from dc and i know they have hidden potential with their characters and just need to find a perfect director if you want to experience a movie that can change your mood and your whole day you should watch this ps  no offense that i think this movie has beaten marvels solo character movie for the past few years cheers,fantasy
amazing visual outstanding chemistry between arthur and mera predictable but somehow not boring plot its fastpaced wavey model of storytelling will keep you on the edge of your seat from begining to end just ignore some of its score espescially that monstrous pitbulls cover of africa and you have yourself an exquisite piece of splashing underwater experience at this point some people who keeps hating on this movie was either a very nitpicky person or simply because it has no marvel logo slaped on its face,fantasy
this is one of the best super hero films i have ever seen with great action and a amazing story defiantly would recommend it to people,fantasy
this movie is one of the rare gems out in the sea every scene looks gorgeous and breathtaking the cast couldnt be more perfect jason amber and nicole were so fun to watcheverything is different this isnt your regular marvel formulaic film cough jl cough the tone itself was quite different and fun to watchthe only reason i gave it a nine out of ten is that the dialogue is fairly predictable and sometimes it sounds like they are reciting a playthere are so many characters and the movie worked it had so many subplots and a lot were happening but it never failed to entertain the viewersalso i would say its the most comic accurate movie out therefinally the soundtrack it was magicalalso mid credit scene ,fantasy
the expression of the third times the charm is the right sentence to describe this filmjames wan provides exceptional quality as a director who has been directing films with horror genres challenged to handle different genresthe actors in the film also gave outstanding performance and were in line with the expectations of the fans considering that for some things films with super hero genre were very difficult to accept if those who played them did not meet the expectations of the audiencepatrick wilson and yahya abdulmateen ii are suitable choices for acting as orm and black mantathe audio visual effects produced by this film are also very extraordinary and dialogues are given if we look as if they are talking in the water but in the appropriate tonewhat is lacking in this first film is the showtime of characters like black manta who are not too prominent but im sure if this film has a sequel then the showtime of characters like black manta can be extended,fantasy
thats got to be the worst movie of 2018 people that give it 10 stars are hopeless and hapless neophytes the first 15 min are especially cringeworthy as every ridiculous cliches imaginable are employed to try to get the viewers in the mood but inexorably fail to do so the music and sound effects are particularly annoying as it made me seriously wonder if all of this was a bad joke while i dont think jason momoa himself makes a bad the rest of the cast seems to have been assembled by a random algorithms spitting out washed up stars i remember seeing better cgi in jurrassic park in 1993 so many other kinds of wrong in this movie dc comics just keeps missing the mark and its pathetic,fantasy
special effects were a perfect mix between star wars avatar and starcraft,fantasy
first of all james wangeniusfor fans of dc its obviously the best dc film since dark knight rises in terms of the overall experiencein terms of fab moments its the best one since bvsprosvfx are better than black panther and ragnarok combined honestly the best since avatar and life of pi if this doesnt win the oscar for visual effects i dont know what willpacingwan does not treat you like a 4 year old babyhes to the point in every scene and treats you like a mature audiencefemale characters honestly the way wonder woman was stupidly shown being a badass by deflecting bulleti mean whathere wan actually gives amazing contextual scenes to mera and queen atlannaespecially showing mera as smart and powerful in actual bad situations and not for the sake of itand queen atlanna as a protective and powerful mother and wiferealistic action sequences i mean the sensibility of the fact that arthur jumping from a rooftop and not landing on his feet almost all the time shows that being a hero does not mean you can do it also there are scenes where arthur also gets beat up and hurt as he shouldrealistically speakingcinematography is other worldlyconsif you have to honestly nitpick anything then i would say it would be the music in some scenes and the little backstory of black manta and king ormi felt they should have been given more stuffbut since its james wan i believe he will unfold more about them in 2finally try and watch it in imax 3d if possible with your friends and family its the most entertaining movie of the year,fantasy
dont get me wrong i am a die hard fan of marvel but this movie took the superhero movies to the next level although the humours are almost awkward but they are unexpectedly funny the actions are awesome the storyline is so fluid and the camera shots are superb i was expecting that movie would be a lame one but it proved me wrong the best superhero movie ever made,fantasy
the story line drags on a little too much in my 32 years of age ive never seen a film that assumes the viewer is as dumb as in this moviei actually was offended and so was the audience which is why the majority walked out early in the movie it is unfortunate as i was expecting something decent but was sorely disappointingi will not be watching any more dc movies until they start catering to the consumeravoid for now,fantasy
after completing the movie i feel good it was not just waste of time over all it awesome ,fantasy
this time best dc movie visual story actor played well specially jason m should go cinema theater to enjoy with u and ur family,fantasy
it is obvious the people that negatively criticize these types of movies are not there just to have fun or enjoy having an escape from reality for a few hours this is just a fun and a visual master piece i love the movie for all that offers i completely ignore what critics say about any movie the people that actually pay to watch the movies are the opinions that matter go and enjoy this amazing fun ride,fantasy
after watching the trailer i went in expecting a really bad movie but from the start itself i was pleasantly surprisedi am not a review writer but if want to have some quality entertainment with great cgi action sequencesthis is the movie to go to  enjoy ,fantasy
i have been anticipating this film for a long time and now has come and i thought this was a great film that hopefully gets the dc universe back on its feet the premise of the film sees arthur curry having to travel to atlantis to stop his half brother from waging a war on the surface world jason mamoa plays arthur curry and i think he is really great in this film he is very charismatic in this film and has a real presence about him his character has alot of development and depth added to him in this film that improve from his previous appearance in justice league the supporting cast all do a great job aswell amber heard plays mera and she is a much betetr character here then she was in her scene in justice league she was more bright and interesting in this film with a unique personality that really worked with her and mamoas chemistry that was great to watch on screen patrick wilson plays orm ocean master and he was a great villain for this film he has got similarities to loki and killmonger but i thought he did a good job in this film to give the audience a possibly layered villain that makes there confrontation more intersting i also thought nicole kidman dolph lundgren  willem dafoe did a really good job with their roles as the more experienced actors on show another shoutout is the character of black manta who looks amazing on screen and was an interesting character however he wasnt in the film enough to leave me fully satisfied by his character the story is interesting seeing this guy having to step up for a society he isnt really accepted in plus i do find a sibling rivalry to be very interesting but this films plot is very bloated they try to fit so much story into this film that certain elements such as black manta get lost in the shuffle and end up not getting the attention that they needed the script is great the drama is well done and provides some pretty emotional moments also the humour in the film came across well and felt pretty natural to me the style of the film is a huge talking point in this film and i must say that mostly it looks amazing seeing these beautiful underwater fight scenes and cities is great and it felt like were beingintroduced to a new community though especially at the beginning of the film the cgi isnt completely up to par and takes you out of the film but it improves as the film progresses overall is another hit for dc after wonder woman and is definitley worth a watch maybe even in 3d,fantasy
im a huge marvel fan and never really enjoyed watching the previous dc movies like suicide squad or jl those were terrible for me but this one wqs different the directing acting and especially the visuals were outstanding this is the dc movie they needed respect to james wan for making this movie even better,fantasy
the movie is a gift from james wan to all comic book fans in the world not just dcthe idea of a movie being underwater means that most of it is going to be cgi and we all know that cgi movies dont work but in it did work the most beautiful cgi that i have ever seen in a movie i mean everything looks realwhen you compare zack footage of arthur mera and vulko you will notice that it is cheap compared to the great costumes james has given us sorry zack i love you but your mera looked ridiculousthe characters are strong in this one not a single character was bad the actors did an amazing job especially jason momoa amber heard and yahya abdulmateen iia lazy director would cut some of the fight scenes but james is not lazy almoat every few minutes there is an epic scene he also added some of the elements he used in his previous movies the horror element and the use of song made me feel that i am watching fast and furiousthe score is wonderful especially black mantas theme and the kingdom of atlantis themei dont usually say this but is the best comic book movie in 2018 and it is better than avengers infinity war,fantasy
this is one of the messiest films ive seen in a long time the plot jumps all over the place with really awkward exposition speeches hammy dialogue and a schizophrenic feel in genre its the most entertaining when its not an movie but leans more into indiana jones territory momoa is still charming and there are some good action moments as well as some amazing images but its really chocking to see how messy this is kinda entertaining in its mess but still is it the savoir of the dceu not by a long shot,fantasy
the acting was incredibly sub par the cgi was slow  terrible if i had a 4k tv it would probably be even worse than what i had to witness on my 8 year old flat screen not to mention the boring  predictable story line not even the violent fight scenes could give any redemption to one of the worst movies that i have ever seen,fantasy
rating 325this movie has no business being 2 hours and 22 minutes long for being as dumb as it is i really dont get how spiderman into the spiderverse can have more characters and tell a more cohesive story in less than 2 hours and look way better doing it while trips all over itself people try to excuse the stupidity of this movie by saying it embraces its comic book goofiness except thats a lie the movie is a mess and it never fully commits to itself some characters play it super straight but their dialogue is so bad that it comes off as generic over the top and just dumbthe movie gives you two villains ocean master and black manta the problem is that theyre two of biggest villains and they could each hold their own movies as the main antagonist black mantas intro is something that could have been very powerful and character building for both and black manta but the garbage dialogue deflates the entire scene as the movie continues black manta just fades into the background as ocean master takes center stage however it makes no sense because black manta gets the origin setup and ocean master doesnt mera and have zero chemistry so when they get this epic kiss its practically meaningless and theres a lot of moments like that where something will be presented as a big deal visually but will have piss poor setup and thus have little to no meaning behind it for example they literally show you dinosaurs in the background of somewhere they go to with no explanation whatsoever and no reaction from the actors its just poorly thought out this is first real venture into this world of atlantis and the 7 kingdoms but you wouldnt know it by the way he acts this whole movie is really about distraction they hit you with something shiny and pretty to distract from the fact that the story doesnt add up and the dialogue is downright stupid most of the time character development be damned jason mamoa does his best but theres only so much he can do with the charisma he hasas for the positive stuff the special effects are fantastic theres one underwater scene that looks really cool mainly because wan gets to go all horror movie director with it and it works to great effect and then the story starts happening again and you remember how dumb everything is smhatlantis looks gorgeous better than wakanda in black panther thats for sure however youre not there long enough to get any sense of what atlantis is or the people which constantly repeats he has no allegiance to in fact they just have mera beat you over the head with exposition which you can take or leave with her generic acting the action scenes are solid nothing super memorable but solid the big fight between armies at the end is all but forgettable just a big cgi mess not as bad as wonder womans 3rd act though still looked gorgeous but despite the stakes you just dont really care because you know how everythings gonna turn out theres no mystery or anything because of how generic and predictable it isin the end yeah its a gorgeous film but its story is borderline asinine and its almost 2 and half hours long which i will admit you dont really feel because everything moves so fast if the movie didnt look as good as it did and move as fast as it does this would be an average film maybe even less as is the craftsmanship manages to drag it into above average territory but just barely note this is nowhere near close to the in the current comics but you might have fun with this movie if you dont think about it too much,fantasy
2 things that let this movie down for me1 there was no real beginningreal explanation or any thought into how grows into his powers the story takes a running leap from him being a little child to him being an adult doing what aqua man does in the sea with pretty much no build up2 the cgi there is so much cgi in this movie some of it good some of it terriblei would still recommend this movie you just gotta not take it to serious kinda reminded me of a cross between tron and black panther movies overall this movie could of been better and i can understand some of the bad reviews but its still watchable in my opinion,fantasy
what an odd film it appears to have been written by a 12 year old who manages to cram every boys fantasy weaponsuper power and love interest into its rather long story sharks that you ride whales that are hollow a baddie taken from blade guns that convert seawater a colossal undersea world that we somehow missed i could go on but it would spoil the film there is no real plot we are told the outcome in the first 3 minutes nicole kidman has a fish suit that appears to age there is no real explanation of what she had been doing for the 20 odd years that she went off grid bottom line the film is complete fantasy with strange humour thrown in amongst gruesome fifer scenes very disjointed almost as though 3 children had conspired to outdo each other then random bits of each story were cobbled together but i actually enjoyed it,fantasy
omg what an awful diatribe of plop have i just watched weak storyline scripting that is beyond parody and i will not comment on the acting out of kindness the visual effects were okay though,fantasy
the visual effects are stunning but that is the only good thing i can say aboutwhat is going on in this film the plot if there is one is a mishmash that is too hard to follow it is one of those movies where too much is trying to be packed inlets go back to as he was in the comics,fantasy
just leave it behind most of us wanted to watch it because of jason momoa and amber heard and of course they were perfect and played well but sadly the movie itself is disappointingi myself wasnt interested in the story and fictional scenes which were too much and really unbelievable even as a fictional oneand even the scene of fighting underwater in a kind of atlantic colosseum when the score board came up i thought that  hey whats really going one score board whats the meaning of this gosh what am i watching wwe or something,fantasy
everything is pretty bad in this movie its like the star wars prequels except with a far larger budget and technology but still ends up looking not much better somehow the dceu is just trash,fantasy
 is a lot of smoke and mirrors to distract you from the convoluted not very interesting plot and the phones in performances jason mamoa  it appears his signature pose is the crooked smile looking over shoulder looks like a hungover hippie dude with the enthusiasm to match visually it glitters but its just tinsel,fantasy
i was never a comic book fan nevertheless i usually enjoy the movies loved all the xmen guardians of the galaxy iron man and so on this not so much the underwater cgi was fantastic the land fight scenes were laughably bad cring worthy acting and dialogue cheesy and thats being kind the lead actor is just eye candy pleasant to look but he cant act hes best with 0 or extremely minimal dialogue he was perfect in got,fantasy
 is my favorite dc movie of all time i will admit that it is a cheesy and bad at some points but gosh dang i love this movie suit is straightout of the comics and black manta is too black manta and ocean master i love as the villains and the whole world of atlantis is spectacular plus that third act is so epic,fantasy
boring superficial waaaay too longboring superficial waaaay too longboring superficial waaaay too longboring superficial waaaay too long,fantasy
ok so this movie is original in many ways the underwater fights the underwater costums the different characters the hair the colored eyes the drumming octopus and keeping underwater captive dont forget they have put alot of hard work in the special effects also it will have cost alot of money time and patient i think that some people forget that most important factthis movie should deservere at least a 910 on imdb i dont understand how this movie could get a rating under 510 serious what can you expect more from this movie and ofcourse the amazing actor jason momoa did an amazing job 1 of the most original movies ive ever soon so farso so so happy ive just seen this movie,fantasy
i always have a soft spot while reviewing and rating comic book movies and this will be no exception i was one of those who believed wouldnt be anything special and even though it earned over a billion dollar pandering to a select demographic i wasnt wrongfor every step this movie takes in the right direction it rewards itself a flaw that in the end brings it back to where it started lets start with the story it is surprisingly an almost faithful adaptation of the throne of the atlantis without any of the justice league and if you watched the snyderwhedon travesty youll know its a good thing a linear but enjoyable storytelling that isnt convoluted with exposition heavy dialogues nor peppered with the 90s laugh track being a fairly simple plot it enjoys the freedom of incorporating elementary gimmicks that is enjoyable for the whole family but wouldnt necessarily leave a bad taste for movie purists either and as a result doesnt shy away from taking a hearty approach to make the titular character more relatable and lovable ironically worked best when it pandered to the 12 year olds and played its strong suit of heart emotion and familyas simple as the storytelling and plot is the script is indifferent i would have a hard time believing this wasnt actually written by a 12 year old you hear a line and if you cant immediately guess the comeback you really havent been seeing movies much lately the script has to be one of the most generic stacks of line ever put together in a billion dollar moviethe jokes are minimal and are not bombarded after every 10 seconds which doesnt make the jbombs decent though most of the time theyre not even funny but youll still crack a smile a few times because your inner 12 year old is still alive inside you one thing i have to appreciate is how they dont ruin heartfelt emotional scenes with a joke which has become quite the cbm tradition nowadaysim not entirely delighted with the cinematography its pretty rough around the edges and really hard to believe this was by james wan this is a type of movie that couldve been made by literally any director and if you didnt know who it is by you never couldve guessed it everything about this movie lacks originality and you cant help but feel it quite often there are some undoubtedly cool shots here and there like the trench diving scene or waterfall scene but those are too few and far between the awkward camera pans made it feel like a hindi tv serial at times hugely disappointed that james wan allowed all these bloated mess of a camera work in the final editthe score was nonexistent aside from the toto remix by pitbull i cant seem to remember any sound even slightly resembling a theme or tone cbms really needs a decent score to pump up the juices which offered none the pacing as i mentioned earlier is actually quite satisfying which doesnt drag on and overstay its welcome in the slightestthis is the part where the aforementioned one step forward one step back quote comes to play the costume design for orm and manta were absolutely impeccable emphasis on the word impeccable as i never couldve conceived that they could make the corny looking orange outfit so badass on screen the prop obviously goes to jason for pulling it off but ill come to him in a bit mera also had her comic accurate leotard on and not gonna lie looked really well on amber heard but for every good costume design there are also few horrendous ones the white atlantean suit looked beyond ridiculous and cheap it reminded me of those henchmen in the old power rangers series and not in a good way the terrible wig of nicole kidman was too bad to ignore amber wore her wig better although its just the longer end of the same strawthe cgi in this movie was painfully inconsistent some amazing underwater scene gets totally overshadowed by a stack of utter disgraceful cgi work i am sure the slowmo mera jumping off buildings during the black manta chase sequence is a perfect example how rough the edges really were on the contrary the visuals were actually quite delightful and the backgrounds selected pleasant the sea creatures looked as good as how bad the cgi looked the trench creatures played in accordance with jamess horror root and looked pretty goodsome of the biggest surprises i got from the movie were actually due to the acting you got more renowned actors like willem dafoe nicole kidman amber heard and on the other side relative lesser known creds like dolph lungdren not exactly lesser known but stereotyped jason momoa and yahya mateen and guess which side did a better job i always believed jason momoa cannot carry a whole movie himself and he brutally proved me wrong he practically carried the whole movie for me if was someone other than momoa i dont think the rating wouldve been what i gave it couldve easily been far less he pumped the charisma up to eleven and even managed to rock that goofy orange outfit like a total badass honestly though most of the points i gave are because of manta orm and momoaas for the villains lets just get it out the way had the best villain adaptations so far in dceu manta was exactly how i know him to be down to his iconic outfit in a proper adaptation although he was fairly underutilized and sidelined i cant wait to see him pop back up in the sequels yahya did some sweetass work properly portraying black manta and deserves more praisepatrick wilson is silently becoming a household name each year and his role in cements his case he naturally blended in with the character like no ones business and actually added subtle nuances orm looked behaved and sounded just perfect where he easily couldve been a luther an ares or even a honka honka props to the costume design team for the faithful recreation of the iconic facemask and cowl and finally doing justice to the rogues of dc universe i am also kinda glad he wasnt made out to be a powerhungry one dimensional stereotype even though he was sort of right in his first outingnow for the terrible acting dafoe wins it by a mile with his most horrendous acting ever really hurts seeing such a talented actor just be there to cash in nicole kidman was a step up but nothing extraordinary you can blame the script she was given and id agree with you mera on the other hand was definitely the better among the trio having more screen time and a better script to work on but as i said nothing that speaks volumefor a superhero movie doesnt have many fights to showcase i didnt like any dceu action sequence other than the warehouse scene in bvs and maybe its just me but overall it was below subpar the first orm vs momoa was bland and contained no gravity and the stakes felt artificial the final encounter was better in every way which unfortunately was abrupt so aside from the manta fights there is absolutely nothing that offers that begs a rewatchfor all the highs and lows was quite enjoyable to me more than i thought was possible it had a good heart and was brimming with a weird innocence that i appreciate i cant stop thinking how better this movie couldve been if they paid more attention to the little stuffs but i can say for sure this was a onetime movie and really has no merit to secure a second watch but hey lucky for them it worked out just finerating 6510,fantasy
i dont like the special effect use in this filmswhy because its sooo ecessive until you cannot differ between the liveaction and animated it is indeed tooo muchh muchh sfx god i feel every scene in the movie too bright it hurts my eyes nevertheless the storyline chemistry between actoractress are should be praised of because it was directed by james wan please for sequel can you reduce the usage of sfx,fantasy
while it may not be a 10 in some ppls opinion it certainly does not need beer in order to watch or to switch of your brain haters gonna hate if there had been a shot of jasons naked backside i would have given it a 10 out of 10 simply for that but overall the characters  scenery deserves at least an 8 dialog was ok timing was good i wanted a little more history about some things but oh well thats the way the cookie crumbles,fantasy
the movie was boring i sat and watch people fight in water with fire does something seem wrong there the start was good but then it just worse and worsethe movie is one bad terrible movie worse than justice league and that a bad bad movie dc are bad movie makers,fantasy
its not great dc consistently miss the mark with their movies wonder woman being the exceptionthe humor is off the cgi isnt good the poses are cliche and forced none of it feels natural,fantasy
through dceus i discovered that there is in fact such a thing as too much when it comes to movies is nearly two and a half hours in length even though it is shorter than the ridiculous 3hr run time of batman vs superman it still feels like too much normally i wouldnt complain im an avid moviegoer and would generally enjoy watching a lengthy story but the 25hr length of this film made me groan and wonder when it will be over had it been a better film that kept me on the edge of my seat in excitement i wouldnt even have noticed but this felt like all the epic grandeur of a star wars adventure minus the thrills and excitement and that risks the onset of boredom the story itself is needlessly complex and burdened by the weight of too many secondary subplots we get it is discovering his destiny hes on a mission to reclaim his rightful place as heir to the throne of atlantis thats a pretty straight forward story go with that why they had to introduce all these extra elements and side missions is beyond meit genuinely seemed like the producers wanted to incorporate as much of the comic book mythos as possible in the span of one film it felt like they went out of their way to get all the locations all the characters and species of creatures and mortals alike in the comic books and highlight them in the film its almost as if they anticipated the criticisms of comic book and superhero purists who would challenge them on their choices and sought to go out of their way to ensure that those groups would catered to and as a result it felt forced for instance not only did you have plot to reclaim atlantis but you also have wars between several different races of underwater people resulting from the politics of this imaginary place were only briefly aware of as well as a subplot focused on the revenge of a blackops mercenary turned laserfaced super villain named black manta who just felt tacked on and unnecessary btw the film also features gladiatorial combat involving sea creatures which postthor ragnarok felt like a ripoff heck it even had a giant octopus playing tribal war drums im not joking the story was silly basically must reclaim his rightful place as the heir to the throne of atlantis but in order to do that he has to go to a particular place to find a thing so that he could take the thing to the other place to do the other thing all the while fighting atlanteans and humans and supervillains and naval submarines and simultaneously remembering all of the supersecret training he received from willem dafoe to become an atlantean warrior which we are slowdrip fed via flashbacks throughout the film oh and he falls in love of coursefrankly i would have preferred if they had split it into 2 films or condensed it by cutting out a lot of the extra stuff that did not move the film forward at all can talk to animals he can ride waves he can summon sharks and whales and control the element of water and do cool stuff with it but none of these special powers are ever used when the need arises if he can summon a school of killer sharks to do his bidding then why doesnt he just summon them to eat his enemies and be done with itas far as acting jason mamoa just doesnt have any skills hes good at flexing his muscles and looking intimidating which i guess is good enough for a superhero film his best asset is his looks its when he has to deliver lines that he looks awkward and out of his element no pun intended his portrayal of is a very sharp contrast to the traditional look of character one wonders where the line is drawn on the look of a superhero for instance batman looks like batman he has a cowl and pointy ears and superman has a red cape and blue tights much like how superman is traditionally supposed to look so then why did dcwarner opt to portray as a tattooed biker that probably smells like fish instead of dressing him in green and orange tights with fish scales on them,fantasy
wanted to enjoy this film but couldnt just about every aspect of the film let me down could not stop feeling like i was watching a ps4 game mamoa was about the only charming character and just barely all the supporting cast offered no support i simply cannot recommend this film even as a dumb popcorn filmdc needs to up its game and spend more budget on writing and acting and less on cgi,fantasy
 2018 is the latest movie directed by the director of saw 2004 insidious 2010 the conjuring 2013 james wan hes known as one of the most talented modern movie directors i havent seen his horror movies but i saw a few clips and they were scary and now he took a challenge on a superhero movie 2018starring jason momoa as arthur curry amber heard as princess mera nicole kidman as atlanna patrick wilson as ocean masterorm willem dafoe as vulko im okay with how they acted theres nothing bad but the problem is that the screenplay was really childish making the acting a bit childish in that case jason just made not really one true king but more like one funny kingthe plot is about a man arthur curry born by a father from the land and a mother from the sea when his mother went away he heard that he had a brother who tried to conquer his mothers land atlantis and he had to stop his brother to be king a bit childish right i saw many superhero plots are like this and this is quite normal and sometimes too easy i really like the jokes they had done to the movie i laughed at many scenes especially when arthur realized that peeing on thei dont know how to call it a thing is much better then mera taking his sweat from his forehead intothat thing it made me giggledshowoff you could have just peed on itthe action scenes were quite epic as atlantis looked better than a paradise with underwater technology and hightech ships and other transports people wore robotic armors and creative weapons the battles are quite unforgettable with stunts here and there and also explosions and disastersthe cgi was mindblowing and jawdropping it was surpring that the budget was just 200 million but the box office had crushed a lot 1147 billion but for the cgi 2018 wouldnt have had its box office so high like this it was totally worth a good dceu movie i also liked the costumes the robotic armor with suitable colours and they even put some on animals like sharks or a few more unreal creaturesi like the score it made us feel like were in a hightech paradise rupert gregsonwilliams did a good job with the original score it was really good and it sounded like tron i had no idea how he made those sounds as long as its not orchestra like john williams i wasnt just relaxed but i also felt really impressed because its really satisfying like jumanji welcome to the jungle or black pantheri like a lot though it was really childish at the screenplay it is one of the best most mindblowing jawdropping and unforgettable movies in the dc extended universe i recommend people like wars underwater should watch this moviepoints 7410,fantasy
this movie which runs 2 hours and 23 minutes consists of 20 minutes of story and 2 hours of action and special effects i find that to be out of balance by the time it was over i felt exhausted and unfulfilled i cant rate it lower than a 6 because its not bad filmmaking its just not my cup of tea,fantasy
when my 8 year old can guess every cliched response there might be a problem script was bad acting was mostly baddolph terrible cgi just looked awful dc has a long way to go to match the magic that marvel brings nicole kiddman was not believable at all and yes dd in her name now as she obviously had new flotation devices installed for her underwater scenesall in all just a decent movie,fantasy
that movie was difficult to sit through i did not enjoy it amber heard should not act willem dafoe should never be a good guy black mantis was a crappy villan jason momoa is just surley and dopish through the whole thing nope nuh uh i expected it to be so much betteroh well,fantasy
wayyyyy too cheesy terrible dialogue subpar acting jason momoas acting was alright but still probably the best part of the movie but not just the worst superhero movie ive seen in a while but the worst movie in general ive seen in a while wish it was better,fantasy
from the beginning to the end is pure hollywood mediocre creativity man woman hero and the rest goes down hill from there dont waste your money dont waste time,fantasy
uuugghh in one wordwhat cheesethe last part amber heards today began in bloodshed  speech was so cringey it should be in the deleted scenesthat war w all the cgi blasting each other felt like 80s arcade game vomit on acid i still gave it 3 stars because of jason willem and the kraken that kraken can act,fantasy
i really struggled to make it through it was poor on so many levels i can only think that the man eye candy is the only reason it got anything above a 2 star rating i would rather go to the dentist than sit through that snore fest,fantasy
this may be one of the worst movies ive ever seen the writing was awful the acting sub par and the cgi was pedestrian at best i never once felt emerced at during any part of this pithy copycat story shades of bad daytime soap opera dialogue and equal acting literally made us laugh almost with embarrassment to those on screen the director was completely unqualified for this gig and did his fair share to fuel this dumpster fire the camera angles were unimaginative the lighting was contrived and distracting it very sad that we waited all these years for and this is what we get an absolute clunker and an embarrassment bad bad bad,fantasy
the level of bad writing directing and acting in aquadude is probably only surpassed by green lantern and dare devil but im not even sure about that i might even be tempted to rewatch jupiter ascending after this mess yes its that bad i mean the sheer amount of clichs fighting for attention in every single scene dont waste your time on this its enough that i did,fantasy
i guess dc were aiming for a movie combining all that was good in the thor franchise star wars indiana jones and a little lord of the rings thrown in for good measure what they got instead is a huge missed opportunitysome of the visual ideas are breathtaking the cgi is incredible and jason mamoa and amber heard have charisma to spare unfortunately what they have to work with is a script not even worthy of a bad b movie and a storyline so hackneyed and obvious it will literally make you groan in placesi really wanted to like this movie but came away pondering would could have been,fantasy
this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen the script writers should be drawn  quartered,fantasy
the best thing about being able to communicate with fish is you can tell them not to swim up your urethraconversely the atlantean in this fantasy is using his sway over vertebrates to claim his throneyears after the queen of atlantis nicole kidman was banished for breeding with a landdweller her mixedrace offspring arthur jason momoa must prevent his halfbrother patrick wilson from amalgamating the seven underwater kingdoms and declaring war on the surface but before he can do that arthur and warrior woman mera amber heard must first retrieve the trident of neptunemore actionadventure than superhero saga this adaptation of the dc comics character is all style over substance thanks to its rudimentary plot childish dialogue and corny villains nevertheless there are some amazing specialeffects and action scenes that redeem its lesser quantitieshowever when youre a water based superhero your archenemy will always be shrinkage yellow lightvidiotreviewsblogspotca,fantasy
two half brothers fight over whos the true king search for the mythical blahblah of whatsit yada yada blerrrspecial effects are fantastic but thats it might as well have spent 25 hours watching a video game when are these super hero moviemakers going to spend any money on a decent writer rather than just a studio hack tasked with joining up the set pieces and inserting the requisite number of funny lines per scene,fantasy
i dont know why many of you compare this one with marvel movies  i dont care who is better universe  i am just a fan of super heroes movies lets let marvel and dc compete and we re the winners anyway this movie is special in my opinion  its the best dc movie after dark knight movies amazing performance of the castawesome cgi and visual effects specially in the oceani love the adventure at alli give it 10 to encourage dc to go on in this direction of movies,fantasy
i had to bear watching this movie because i do not want to miss any details about dc universe besides acting being bad the action packed scenes keep you immersed if you are a fan you can watch it during your spare time,fantasy
my brain gave up on this movie 20 minutes in how does this have rave reviews i am genuinely so confused boring incredibly underwhelming experience,fantasy
take a little bit of finding nemo mix in a bit of shark tale and finally throw the little mermaid into this appalling mess and there you have itnot one second of it made any sense,fantasy
in 1985 lighthouse keeper tom curry rescues a woman from the stormy sea shes atlanna nicole kidman the queen of atlantis they have a son together named arthur in order to keep him safe she leaves them for atlantis where she is forced to marry another her advisor vulko willem dafoe is tasked to train arthur in the present arthur is jason momoa a justice league hero in rescuing a russian sub he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son david kane reason to seek revenge as black manta mera amber heard informs arthur about an impending invasion by atlantian forces led by orm patrick wilson orm is arthurs younger halfbrother atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the trench as the eldest son of atlanna arthur has more claim to the thronedirector james wan delivers a cgi extravaganza the level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it i would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe the movie is like a freight train without brakes i need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor the pee joke is funny the movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work i love the crazy warcrabs but its sensory overload the first speed bump occurs when challenges orm to a fight in the thunderdome it would have been more reasonable for mera to bring arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a doublecrossing orm it would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight it would also make orm more underhanded evil as for the creatures from the trench i would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight i expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent this is a good rebound from the lows of the dceu although i hope the franchise can do more character work and less cgi fights there is too much of a good thing,fantasy
pathetic to sum it up one dimensional and vapid dc time to catch yourselves on and stop pouring out swill thats only barely surviving on your name,fantasy
after watching wonder woman i had some hope for more dc comics making waves on the big screen seriously after the christian bales rendition of batman i had disappointment after disappointment with anything dc comic until wonder woman and yes ive seen justice leaguetrailer gave me hope this is a very good thought out movie but the execution was horrendous no chemistry whatsoever between the leads granted great cast but thats all that this movie hasand to think such a cast was subjected to this  i just dont get where it went wrong they all just seemed like it was their 1st gig honestly disappointing doesnt even fit at one point i thought i was watching mission impossible with a lukewarm version of tom cruise yes i know how that sounds even worseim chucking it with green lantern and lets just not talk about it ,fantasy
there is no reason that i know for why turned into the modern cgi version of the little mermaid liberally mixed with aladdin and the lion king i mean yeah black panther was mostly lion king but it was interesting and fun and the world building was not bad feels cartoonish from the start to the very end the pointless cgi heards horrible wig all the fairy tale characters that seek to show us how they are superior to people on the surface who have grown up reading about single dimensional characters like them the predictability that one can find in children stories only to be honest the feeling i have most about this film is outrage it is condescending and dumb its the hollywood version of homer telling bart hes stupidand then there is the cast jason momoa who i liked in atlantis the stargate one because he was supposed to have only one dimension amber heard who hasnt had a good role in ages and sporting that eye soar of a bad wig nicole kidman and willem dafoe getting their paychecks and dolph ludgren wtf the main character of this story was patrick wilsons he had the most relevant scenes he was the only one who actually looked like he gave a damn about his performance he is the true king of the filmbottom line it was so dumb it was offensive,fantasy
wow that was bad lol awful acting awful effects a child wrote the script why cant dc make movies like the batman trilogy anymore,fantasy
every bit of every comic i ever owned and every cartoon i ever watched brought to life,fantasy
this is the best dc movie ever since the darknight rises have full package of everythingbest castingbest cgiand best story,fantasy
first half promising slowly descends into mindless twoddle even the oneliners arent funnyreally feels like the production just gave up half way into it the action becomes boring the plot falls apart and turns into some indiana jones wannabe wont be watching the end i know exactly what will happen terrible,fantasy
i have never seen such an effort to try and keep a sinking ship afloat jason momoa is a fun actor theres no denying that he tried his heart out to make the best of what is certainly the worst dialogue in the last 10 yearsnicole kidman is always a charmer however this movie somehow dulled her usually effervescent glow the actress can deliver a line the problem here is just that there was nothing good to deliver amber heard is lovely yet quite boring in the role she hoped would define her still johnny depp didnt deserve herthe most confusing fight scenes ever seen on film are present throughout and this is probably the weakest storyline since independence day 2i cant fathom how anyone saw this movie and thought wow thats the best thing ive ever seen my teenage daughter who is a lover of all things superhero agreed with me wholeheartedly that the cgi work on this film was substandard horrible dialogue seems to have been made up on the fly and the giant seahorses knocks you off scale because we all know seahorses are just a few inched high at one point my daughter turned to me and said dad how big are the altantians like 4 tall we both cracked up at that mental imagerythe dceu still does not compare with the mcu it just doesnt it never will i loved wonder woman but that was in spite of the story not because of it gal gadot is just fantastic and wonderful to watchthis movie had me looking at the clock thats never a good thing i wanted to give this movie a 4 but my daughter said it had more redeeming qualities than that i relentedi cant believe i live in a world where people think this is a great movie and trump is a great president i mean cmon man,fantasy
great if youre the mental age of a 5 year old ,fantasy
this film has music that doesnt have a running theme jason is great hes just completely let down by the director script writers and music concept every other film even across marvel world has theme music that you instantly know is for that certain main character this film has music for like a tv show to old power rangers style actionit was just so not good i do not recommend it at all so let down sadly could have been made simpler,fantasy
i love superhero movies but this has bored me senseless yes its pretty but mostly its just a silly cartoon go watch moana instead,fantasy
goodness me what a mess at times it was so bad i couldnt tell if you are meant to laugh at it or with it there is a lot thrown at the screen visually but old fashioned things like dialogue character story also matter,fantasy
if you want a cliche plot about a superhero who beats up the bad guys with characther complexity and dialogues like that of highschool theatrical performance than this is the movie for you the only thing that can be priased about the movie is its special effects and if someone is to get a prize it is the geeks who worked day and night to create a video game visuals which is like 85 of the content of the movie otherwise excellently played by jason momoa although i feel like he is wasting his talent playing in cheese kickass cliche roles,fantasy
dont go by the reviews and collections horrible script disaster visual effect and boring lengthy movie probably the worst hyped of movie of the yearwatch if you have nothing better to do,fantasy
the cgi is great the acting is great and alot of stuff happens but it doesnt feel rushed i had alot of fun with this movie and jason mamoa amber heard did a great job i am so glad this movie this delivered i was waiting for it for a long time,fantasy
wtf at 30 minutes left my jaw dropped and it stayed down for the rest of the movie this might just be the most insane movie i have seen in my life it is far from the best but in terms of insanity its off the scales,fantasy
is was a great movie i loved the story line and the characters the movie effects was unbelievable of fantastic i would recommend this movie to everyone if you think that this movie is a piece of  please just tell me a better one for now,fantasy
 was amazing it had plenty of thrilling action sequences and a decent soundtrack the casting for both leads jason momoa as and amber heard as princess mera were absolutely spoton momoas excitable attitude and mannerisms authentically made arthur curry a smug charismatic badass in every right jason momoa couldnt be a better and he played the role perfectly princess meras collected personality and actions complemented his character well and vice versa arthur curry and mera proved themselves as compelling characters with rich and meaningful motives to drive their actions and choices forward the chemistry between them was equally solid built on meras perceptive view and helped her learn to not judge a place or person at first glance whereas she gave him clarity towards his responsibilities and helped him learn how to become accepting of them and his birthright helping him to understand that he needed to become atlantis king despite the mental deconstruction that he received at the colosseum about how a halfbreed atlantean human wasnt fit to be king they both taught one another to look beyond the surface and do what they thought was right for them these characters built upon one another and gave us believability to their partnership the storyline itself was solid a good mix of heart and action black manta was albeit a bit driventhinking with his heart and not his head but proved himself as a okay done villan with a sort of dramatic vengeance towards patrick wilsons ocean master proved better and was the right choice for the main villan his egotistical pride and arrogance combined with his motives of striking against the surface served him well throughout the movie his beliefs that atlants was superior to the surface world due to sophistication and his arrogant pride coincided with this and proved again that every great villan is a hero in his own story vulko queen atlanna and tom curry were also well written characters prominent in their own rights visualsvfx were a stunning sight to witness and were surprisingly well done atlantis and the various types of sea creatures were precisely crafted especially the monsters of the trench and the kraken at king atlans tomb the costumes of mera vulko and others were surpsingly well done and authentic enough to their comic book counterparts but also modified to fit a fresh and new take of the cast however there were a few flaws too being the teenage actor of the unanswered question of how arthur and mera got from the middle of the sahara to sicily italy despite the close proximity of each location these flaws among others are noticeable but not too distracting from an overall enjoyable and exciting story james wan did an amazing job as did the cast and crew to make a visual spectacle and a story with both action and heart to provide depth to its ensemble cast of memorable characters in short this is a flawed but extremely enjoyable movie that does justice,fantasy
my headline explain everything this is the 2nd best dceu movie for me with all the intense storyline and awesome underwatee cgii give 8 minus jason momoas costume for me its too fancy as an with all the shiny green and gold keep it simple like smallvilles with jason in it will make it look more awesome,fantasy
when i heard james wan was going to direct i was cautiously optimistic dc comic movies are dark and gloomy the only exception being wonder womanthen i saw the trailers and knew dc had made the right choice in choosing the man who also directed fast 7 is easily dcs best movie in my opinion it bests marvels best apart from infinity warjason momoa totally nails it he is not your everyday comic book hero he is a beer drinking fist slugging rugged foul mouthed protagonist who develops into something morethe story is not that special but the way it was executed was what impressed me the flashback scenes came in at the right times the action scenes are just so cool and wonderful hard hitting toothe visuals just left me gaping just imagine star wars combined with avatar and you get an idea of what im talking aboutthe score was just out of this world all the actors did a great job the outstanding ones are jason momoa and willem dafoethe russo brothers had better think of a way to top this avengers endgame cos this movie is the pinnacle of superhero moviesthank you james wan and jason momoa i am so proud of this movie undoubtedly one of the best superhero movies ever made,fantasy
would watch it again to write a propper review if it wasnt such a terribly bad moviebut in short terrible plot predictable silly in a bad way some special effects are good but then again some are very bad way to long,fantasy
if you like disney go watch it otherwise stay clear of it jason momoa is not great but also not bad in his role though yet amber heard is terrible and should stick to suing exes and becoming a makeup sales rep what the hell were willem dafoe and patrick wilson doing here wasted talent was there even a plot typical dumb hollywood film,fantasy
we never really know what lays in the ocean dont apologise for past mistakes just fix it ,fantasy
wont kill your neurons toxic masculinity in the way wonderful effects,fantasy
the house of is built on a concrete slab of cgi i actually giggled during over the top cliche script moments and thats not good im gonna need a bigger gun for example the opening scenes were good kidman was miscast and opportunities for screenwriting were usually abandoned in favor of stiff dialogue worth a look but i wont be adding this to my bluray collection in 2019,fantasy
with my standard set low i came in to this film expecting it to be an over processed piece of junk with the only thing keeping it a float being jason momona aka his body however this film took me by surprise they reinvisioned making him likable funny and a rounded but rough main character i felt a depth to his character and to his female counter part was more than a pretty face as well she complimented him and was also fitting to the role once you got pass her devilishly red hair she also didnt just sit by as he did all the work she had her share of the battles and did better than in most of the fightsin the same way wonderman knew little of the outside world she knew little of the above world although she didnt brush her hair with any forks she felt a real character and part of the team and it worked well with not knowing as much about the undersea world but it made me wonder how he spent so much time in the ocean and not come across the under water city or any other atlanitanslook away now if you dont want any spoilersim glad you like the spoilers i like them tooso things didnt always make sense whether it was the badly put together bad guys really black manta seriously or the war which was waged on a shoe string the plot was thin and very much like black panther in all honesty but there was so much going on you didnt have time to think about itfrom new creatures to the predictable jump scares to the over the top music they flooded the screen with one thing after another although the funniest thing in the whole movie was the music and the biggest let down it took over one scene was supposed to be romanic and they had no speaking only the music to carry the scene along it felt out of place and out of touch very much like guardians of the galaxy 2the other let down was in coalition with the music the zooming in as if we dont know who the character is or what meaning is it supposed to be without loud drums and sudden shots just of the heros face it was tacky and over done it was a problem not carried as much throughout the movie but at the begining it was very over the top while the ending well youll just have to watch it to find out that dramaso in all i found it funny and really enjoyed it for the comedy it isthe film deserves its place just under wonderman far above superman but still its a comedy take it for what it is and dont worry theyll remake the dc world again and hopefully will get it the right balance,fantasy
while watching this film my sone and i devised the game the premise is simple you watch this film with a timer running and a pen and notepad every time you see a line concept scene or cliche which is undeniably stolen from another film you write the time and the reference down the person with the most winsthe whole film is just scenes from some of the most successful films of all time strung together in some sort of guaranteed formula concept of ensuring success that patently has failed to workiitsnot a bad film its not as terrible as people make out but it has too many plot holes and failures to allow yourself to escape into the universe and put the faults behind you to make any real constructed frame which makes the film whole but no joke its like watching every film you have ever seen before strung into one with scenes from star wars warcraft harry potter game of thrones how to train your dragonking arthur avatar finding nemo indiana jones pirates of the caribean herculesand i dont mean these are similar themes they are full identifiable scenesthroughout the film you question choices of rational like why did the mother stay away so long it tries to explain but the answer doesnt make senseoverall switch your brain off and enjoy the ride if you bother to think in the film you will quickly turn into dispising it,fantasy
awful you should choose when was producong the film make it as a classic or 3d film but not try to use the both it looka very cheap and without taste,fantasy
great fun film  with good lead actors  great underwater scenes and action packedlooks prime for a sequel ,fantasy
 exceeded my expectations in every way this is the type of superhero story that ive seen directors in the past get over confident in and simply tell the story it appears the director james wan has seen that far too often and really got creative on how to keep the viewer engaged beyond just the cgithe story within the story is how a man who was raised on land but the powers to live under the sea adapts to living in the abyss for longer than he has before some of my favourite moments are when meraamber heard is adapting to life on the surface and her acting indicates that shes enjoying her experience on land more than she thought she wouldjames wan has all sorts of little plot twists that helped keep me engaged throughout the whole movie i would like to see more of that style in the upcoming dc filmsthe acting is just ok for me in this film and thats why i didnt score it a 9 or a 10 no one really steals the show and jason momoa has a tough rugged image but i havent seen anything from him that would suggests there is an oscar in his futurethis is a movie you can just sit back and let it entertain you for 2 hours i highly recommend the film and i believe this is a cut above the rest of the dc movies i have seen to date other than the nolan movies,fantasy
what a underwhelming experience this was great material completely wasted by poor writing leading to mediocre acting in a movie that feels rushes from start to finishthe backstory is quite rich in emotionally poising element which are never really exploited a great example is the honorable relationship between the hero and ocean life in the comics in the movie the animals of the sea are reduced to expendable weapons which atlanteans do not hesitate to destroy by the hundredscompelling visuals the cgi is quite good in some aspects and creates an engaging atmosphere but the film relies way too much on it losing touch with any kind of realismentirely predictable the script holds no surprise or twist and the dramatic moments are poorly executed leaving you wishing for a special moment that never comeshorrific dialogue cheesy contrived and often cringeworthy several scenes deserve heavy skippingzero character development apparently were supposed to accept characters as they are introduced to the screen with no backstory or arch whatsoever,fantasy
i went in with high hopes i do love jason momoa and he was the nicest guy when i met him visually the film looks amazing but the script was so poorly written and predictable i wanted to love it unfortunately it just left me wishing for vincent chase and james camerons version,fantasy
this movie takes itself wayy too seriously is a very silly character with outrageous powers and a hilariously complicated backstorylore this movie should have embraced some of that cheesiness and used it for intentional comedic effect like thor ragnarok did saying this is the best dc film is like saying thor the dark world is the best mcu filmevery attempt this movie makes at a real joke completely falls flat when i saw this movie in the theater it was packed shouldertoshoulder and no one laughed once the parts i did find funny were parts that were supposed to be serious but were executed terribly without getting into spoilers there was a flashback scene with a teenage and the actor playing him was so bad it might be the funniest scene of the entire dceu and it was supposed to be one of the most emotional parts of the whole moviemost of the acting is very wooden and dull except for willem dafoe and parents the rest of the characters all felt like they were in the star wars prequelsspeaking of which the cgi in this movie is about onpar with revenge of the sith which came out almost 15 years ago i know dc had a lower budget this time around but come on the first transformers movie is over a decade old and the cgi in that is still 20000 leagues above thisas far as the plot itself goes this movie couldve been cut in half and it would have actually been better black manta served no purpose in the plot whatsoever oceanmaster shouldve been the sole villain the only reason manta was shoehorned into this too was because dc knows there probably wont ever be a sequel to thisalso were only given minimal backstory to the city of atlantis and its citizens so the final fight has no real stakes momoa and heard dont have any chemistry either which brings down the film even further because 75 of it is all just the two of them togetheri went into this movie really wanting to love it and for it to redeem dc after justice league i went in with fairly high expectations because of high reviews and was pretty let down it may be more faithful to the comic book source material than man of steel and suicide squad but those films have much more rewatchability and are overall more entertaining than this,fantasy
the story of moses updated with horrible writing and acting plus some flashy techno thats supposed to make it all look good wwf action all were missing is a canvas mat and some folding chairs smashing over the back of the good guy shall we go watch lord of the rings againlittle environmentalism and there you have two hours of a mishmash of every hero quest movie ever remade and remade and remade sort of like unwarmed over mac n cheese with way too much stale cheese if im charitable the movie could have been a spoof of the whole genre except nowhere do they hint that theyre not taking the whole thing seriously,fantasy
the first 70 of the movie was full of holes and nonsensical there are a lot of moments that were just ridiculous and cliched but the worst was definitely the fact that most of the movie just didnt make sense only the last 4045 minutes redeemed it but by then i was dying to get out of the theater it is really too bad because i love superhero moviesit is not worth the money,fantasy
heres the short version if i were still a 14 year old boy i would think this was great but im not so i dont but it was still fun in a bmovie kind of waybad points1 it telegraphs every plot point the love interest is obvious the mother returning is obvious the victory is obvious there are no plot surprises in this movie unless you have never seen a movie before2 the plot holes are gaping wide the sahara desert sequence is a prime example two primarily underwater creatures strand themselves in the middle of the worlds biggest desert with no water and no transport and then instantly appear in sicily with no explanationyes its really that bad3 the dialogue is awful4 it suffers from too many villains the black manta would have better saved for a sequel he is just an annoying distraction here5 it relies a bit too heavily on cgi which just emphasises the teen boy fantasy vibe although i suppose thats fair if its the target audiencegood points1 its fun as a popcorn movie2 jason momoa is fun as in the few moments hes allowed to have any character development he really shines3 the final battle is unexpectedly greatits a harmless way to kill a couple of hours but i suspect its best watched at home where you can laugh at the bad script with your friends talk about the crazy plot holes do atlatean women always have a change of clothes with them at all times and fastforward the sahara bit not really worth paying to see at the cinema aside from the end battle,fantasy
 finally ended up in a movieits entertainment so really people are going to like all sorts of things but this one was big loud colourful and not great to meeveryone is commenting on how jason momoa is having fun id be having fun too if i was paid a couple of million  to basically do nothing plus when the film is a bad as aqauman what else was he going to do probably worked as a comic but on the big screen no so much the story is okay but drowns in the ludicrousness of being you know underwater the film drowns in cgi theres lasers underwater armour underwater flying around underwater  you get the idea admittedly what else could you do with a character as lame as arthur curry at least james wan had a go at it he failed but whatever it made a billion  so he wins and the rest of humanity pays the pricei think that it proves that cgi wins the kiddies over every time regardless of how lame the story is or even how lame the premise of the film is without the cgi this film would still suck it just wouldnt look as goodthe acting is okay if the acting equivalent of watching wet fish are your thing these days in films like this you dont really need to act you just stand there you may have to jump around a bit but thats all the acting part is not really requiredthe story is bleached like todays coral lifeless and clichedthe cgi is numbing like your eyeballs getting slapped with a million tiny wet fishesim sick over cgi overhyped comic book hero movies every marvel film is the same dc are at least different they eschew even the semblance of story for bloated cgihey i mean i paid to go and see it too but the difference is that i regret it,fantasy
not my cup i guess cliche after cliche scenes  quotes stolen from a dozen other flicks disjointed underdeveloped characters and my gawd cornball many cringe worthy moments  disappointed ,fantasy
i thought the movie would be at least decent given the publicity that the film made 1 billion when i watched the film it appeared to be too fake the conversation dynamic was so unnatural and unrealistic the movements just everything about the film so disappointed,fantasy
it is not good this type of movie would have worked 5 years ago  maybe  its lazy predictable bad performances sound or forced music  its good to pass the time not much more,fantasy
having seen this movie three times i cannot say enough good things there are corny moments which i accept are part and parcel of comic movies for example being in the middle of a war and people start kissingthink we should let that clich go in peace nowbut i truely appreciate the way this film is done its not there to be loved by critics and revered as revolutionary its a simple origin comic movie that is made to be enjoyable in every way the underwater scenes were remarkable the acting was spot on the motivations were all very believable i do really think this film is the beginning of a new dceu shout outs to mamoa heardwilson all fantastic orm real stand out,fantasy
if anything this will be another achievement in cgi cinematography the things we can do with our computers haha the dialogue was horrible not having blonde hair still bothers me the actor is miserable he didnt motivate me like thor did on his initial movie i love dc comics go back to the dark knight and please get some inspiration,fantasy
the visual effects and cgi in this movie are fantastic atlantis looks amazingamber heard plays mera really well especially when its her characters first time on landjason momoa is solid with several funny one liners you could tell he really felt comfortable and ran with his characteroverall would definitely see again in the cinema,fantasy
no doubt its a good dceu movie only next to wonder women but what irked me a little is that the whole movie was shot in some kind of hurry so many things to cover in so less time hence pace of the movie was high editing could have been better thats one second  it failed to bring the humour it intended this could have been easily avoided,fantasy
i dont know if im in love with jason momoa or amber heardthe cgi in this movie is the best of 2018the story is perfect and the charactersjames wan thank you for such a great movie and thank you for make our dreams come truedc best movie of all his dc extended universe,fantasy
what a disappointment this is the reason why im a marvel fan was so cheesy corny and over the top the introduction of black manta was completely superfluous to the movie it was derivative of so many other movies clash of the titans tron thor avatar moana among others i wish id gone to spiderman instead,fantasy
wowi have a new least favorite superhero moviethere were very few good parts of this movie the cgi was overdone and the acting was very subpar the worst part though was the entirely inconsistent physics its normal in any fictional universe to have different physics from real life but it needs to be consistent and this movie was like the writers and director didnt even think about it so when underwater apparently some things move slower but others dont some things fall slowly and other things fall like theyre in air its apparently just fine to stand on something while being propelled through the water and the water has the same friction as airthe only way this gets anything better than a 4 or 5 is because dc is paying reviewers,fantasy
i dont know if dc wanted to do a soap opera and a comedy in the same movie but they did i dont understand how did they manage to put cheesy moments silly jokes and a weakly constructed history in the same movie without feeling that everything was wrong,fantasy
loved christ i go along to all these superhero movies love some put up with others im totally not a comic book nerd or with it when it comes to the theme of marvel or dc but i enjoyed for us poor mumshes very easy on the eye  cgi heavy as usual but a good story yeah i really likehes up there with thor ,fantasy
i have been waiting for this finally a decent movie that does justice to the character and the dceu as well i was very pleased with the storytelling overall and james wan did a great job to capture the essence of such universe and the whole atmosphere felt amazing even the action scenes were very pleasing and eye catching never a dull moment in this film overall go and watch this because it is worth checking i know a lot of people dont really like the dceu that much but this film is worth it it is even better than wonder woman cannot wait for the next chapter,fantasy
who ever thought would get a movie or guardians of the galaxy or most of the other super hero movies weve gotten jason mamoa is a big presence but not the best actor so dc surrounded him with great actors this is a super cast and a pretty good story though its pretty much what i expected and a lot more stuffed in just in case they dont get another chance i think they will get to do another but its going to be hard because weve seen so much in this movie this movie is fun and well done and also clearly a james wan moviefor those fast and the furious watchers there is a scene ripped right out of fast five the main flaw and its hard to fault an underwater movie is the overuse of cg effects this is a problem with all dc movies especially in the third act and this one overly so marvel does cg too but dont rely on it as much but its hard to help it as i said with so much under the sea a lot of it looked great hair flowing around some of the huge explosions now that ive seen this movie competently done i cant imagine what cant be done in movies in the right hands,fantasy
i think this puts james wan in the same league as jj abrams audience i saw it with clapped at the end i tell you we have not seen such a creative fantasy script and vfx since the last jj filmwhile james and jj both lack the strong moral compass of spielberg excepting this is as creative a fantasy script and vfx as you could hope for i come from seeing close to every fantasy movie and superhero movie made i first liked james wan on the xfiles and have followed his horror films from a distance james brings a great deal together here hes working with wellworn tropes but manages again and again to make them seem freshthor ragnarok is the appropriate comparison here another crowd please another comic book come to life successfully has more weight and depth than thorr due to its heros journey arci see critics criticizing for clashes of tone when multiple critics say this and i do not i always wonder how many were simply looking between the screen and checking their emails on their smart phone i went to art school and have written 44 books where shadings of tone visually and verbally are crucial is a masterful blending of goofy and serious moods even an octopus playing multiple drums fits ina lesser presence in one or more of the main roles could have sunk this effort the plot point shuffling of trident fight one ending inconclusively leading to a whole middle section heros journey to get to the second and final trident fight is amazing effective to keep the narrative afloat the drone rooftop chase footage is used to great effect in a behind the scenes youtube james says at a superhero movie the audience should feel like they are learning something from the characters and that they inspire us to see our own capacity to do good in our own lives does 910 on both of these,fantasy
my issue with dc movies since christopher nolans batman series has been that theyve tried too hard to repackage the dramatic seriousness of those films and have come up short multiple times with dc has finally done a great job imitating the tried and true recipe for quality marvel films not taking itself too seriously isnt supposed to be an overly dramatized superhero he represents what batman and superman dont a sense of humanity in an otherwise sideways world with witty humor and a star who youd be stupid to not want to grab a beer with hits in all the right notesjames wan brought to life a completely new vibe for dc films from the masterful cinematography to the outstanding use of vibrant colors to bring to life the deep sea nothing feels recycled or over the topif i had any drawback at all it would be that the film kind of feels like a typical superhero movie thats hard to connect with on a personal level it didnt do an incredible job of demanding your buyin and emotional connectivity with the characters and the final battle takes place in a relatively meaningless location leaving a lot to be desired hereoverall the film was brilliantly well done and should quickly become a standard bearer for how dc films of the future should be made,fantasy
i wasting expecting to have so much fun watching this movie i went to see jason who i loved in stargate you can tell that he is having fun with all the aspects of the movie fun to watch and made the long time run go very fast ill see it again,fantasy
 the i knew and loved when i was a comic reading kid had short hair was clean shaven and wore spandex now we have a hydrohippie who looks like a young well fed willie nelson this is a good film but is overlong and contains some terrible dialogue the general acting and effects make up for this thoughthe wonderful undersea city of atlantis could be a submerged la from blade runner as minisubs ape the actions of flyingcars there are merpeople lobster lads and lassies even creatures from the trench who resemble gigers alien these are regressed tribes of atlantis who exist alongside the human tribes we see the fall of atlantis in thew distant past when mans hubris brought about its destruction striking back at te surfacedwellers the atlanteans send tsunamis crashing ashore wrecking naval ships and returning decades of pollution to the land wants to prevent war between the occupants of the land and the denizens of the depth but to do this the halfblood prince will have to claim the throne of atlantis meanwhile hes managed to annoy a pirate who pursues a blood vendetta against him all good fun if a tad drawn out 710,fantasy
i just watched the trialmy son went to see and said was greatjust by the trailer im amazedsome music perfect for the movie i think they should put it for a best picture and best actor,fantasy
i am a huge fan of the dc universe  but i was not really into didnt know his story or who he was i thought that it wasnt gonna be as good as it was i got to go see it today and i loved it  the story was great the action and fight scenes just intense  and the visuals were just so amazing and beautiful love the underwater affects  it was overall a great dc film,fantasy
at the risk of sounding gushy i really really enjoyed sure jason mamoa was a big reason for that but this was a pure fantasy excitement ride a few times i had to remind myself to relax while watching the almost nonstop action imo forget all previous incarnations of momoa nails the part gritty but not too much cool but not fake coolhes just cool period perfect physically for the role i mean wouldnt be 6 4 and very handsome the action and cgi of this movie are beautiful you really get to delve into fantasyland for 2 hours every character was portrayed well by each actor there is no portrayal that i didnt like and it has a good story line that kept me interested frankly it was so entertaining ive already seen it twice and plan to see it in imax at least once more definitely a big screen movie as there are scenes where there is a lot going on visually,fantasy
for some reason fresh tomatoes and i believe many critics are leaving reviews of this film that lead you to believe that it is not very good this is not true this movie is almost as good as wonder woman it stands head to shoulders in quality with wonder woman the recent batman movies and the recent superman movies it is truly that goodthe way james wan the guy behind dead silence and other horror movies and crew have brought atlantis to life is simply amazing and epic in scope it reminds me of the depth and quality of valerian i felt the same way watching this as i did when i watched the first iron man movie i enjoyed this as much as i have enjoyed iron man the batman movies and wonder womanit is not perfect by any means and both my parents thought it was slightly cheesy in parts i did not i was thoroughly caught up the scope of the adventure here i enjoyed this even more than mortal engines yet another gem i am not a fan of momoa and lundgren is not much better as an actor neither of them could act their way out of a wet paper bag but both were at the top of their game here did you even recognize dolphie in thissadly this movie is being railroaded in my area they tell me it is brand new yet they have only one 3d showing at around 11am 12pm at regal cinemas and cinetopia look it up for yourself writing this on 122019 and am in the vancouver wa area there is some sort of concerted effort between local theaters and the folks at fresh tomatoes to destroy this film to sabotage it and i have no idea whyif you have been hesitating you better go and see it in 3d for yourself right now avoid imax if you can real 3d has the most comfortable glasses if you are stuck with imax swallow the price tag and uncomfortable glasses you will not regret it trust me if you loved wonder woman if you enjoyed valerian then you will certainly love this movie it is backed by a number of excellent actors and actresses and everyone is doing their best in their various roles this movie is an absolutely stunning epic you do not want to missand if the theaters in your area are not providing afternoon and evening 3d showings or even 2d showings you need to speak up the only way to stop them is to break the silence check the disparity in user reviews to the fresh tomato score you will see something is fishy here no pun intendedi wish they had let james wan handle justice league that movie truly was a flop but this one just about makes up for it,fantasy
this is simply the best dc movie yet1 story 10102 cinematography 10103 acting 10104 visual effects fights and choreography 1010,fantasy
fun super hero movie dont expect a mind blowing plot but its good enough with some idealogical concepts to think about,fantasy
after viewing multiple dc movies i have concluded that they suck excluding the dark knight trilogy i have been repeatedly disappointed or bored but this was the first movie that actually interested me its vibrant color cgi and scenery make this better than most superhero movies in general couple that with the plot and action they have a win in my book,fantasy
the story it is a superhero movie so the ending is kind of expected typical ending however there is part 2 in the future so cant wait to see how the story to be continuedthe directing wow the underwater world is so gorgeous their imagination is so creative jason momoa is perfect for this role his image  charisma is perfect fit for a superhero,fantasy
honestly and this is not just because jason momoa was the leadbecause i loves him this movie was amazing the graphics and scenery were awesome the costumes looked great the fight scenes were incredible everything was just so good even down to the little details of the way the hair was flowing and looking like they were actually under water in a current the wire work looked flawless cgi was awesome amazing amazing amazing huge congratulations to the whole cast and crew james wan you did an amazing job dude,fantasy
was looking forward to this and yet it disappointed on so many levels the story was cliched and weak way too reliant on cgi and at times unpleasant to watchshook my head at times for how the ridiculous story developed black mantra looked like a power rangers tv villain i felt ripped off paying 35 for my family to see thisdisappointed with dc excessive cgi trying but failing to impress,fantasy
its a good movie overall but there are many many parts that didnt make sense and im being nice for the score i gave the cgi was good good casting and acting other than that its mediocretbh i would give it a 3 because all the superhero movies are predictable but this one was too predictable,fantasy
i grew up reading comics particularly justice league superman and green lantern when i heard they were doing green lantern i did a happy dance but after watching it however it was bitterly disappointing i liked man of steele and batman v superman and thought wonder woman was really good justice league was just ok with a few really good scenes blew all recent dc offerings away as many have said the visuals are spectacular the acting was great storyline was great jason mamoa was prefect in the title role the movie held my interest from start to finish and bulit up pace nicely till the climax theres always going to be those people especially those familiar with the character who will say they could have done better thats true for every film its no infinity war but dc were definitely spot on with,fantasy
its ridiculous how people want to make the rating lower just because its dcthe movie is awesome it will make 800mil1billion dollarsthe final real score of the movie should be 7610 but it will be lower from haters,fantasy
meaning brought a great celebration to christmas 2018 overall all went according to and since he is a man continuing that all the way in india it has brought site searchers to this land of warner bros presentation,fantasy
thanks dc for giving content orient movies i watched in pakistan ,fantasy
when one of the most badass men in hollywood is cast to play one of the silliest characters to ever come out of a comic book you get a new version of that has a literal ocean of potential the plot might be pretty standard and the pacing way too fast for its own good but the characters are interesting enough to stand out on their own the action is exhilarating and the cgi effects are so eyepopping and colourful that no other dc movie resembles them,fantasy
i love everything about this movie must watch this one,fantasy
this is an enjoyable movie with great visual effects if you are a comic book fan it is worth watching dc has been about average with their movies so far so this is a step in the right direction,fantasy
read this while listening to everything i need by skylar grey on looping  ladies and gentlementhere is only one true king  zack snyder 2015im really selective when reviewing a film however i put an exception on this one 2018 is a mind blown simple and powerful performance from the cast is enough to inspire tears or at least goosebumps this is my third time watching in the theatre and i rated this movie deserves 9 stars out of 10 the movie is deserved to get my money and i think i will continue to support it until the 4th time if u guys know me you guys know that im a movie aficionado aka cinephile and a film that has a good combination of cinematography and music will certainly make me enjoy it to the higher leveli love and enjoyed our kuchingborn underdog director mr james wan ive followed his work since saw film and his work in the conjuring universe is exceptional his skills in directing is well respectedeven though dceu is a second class or blist while mcu is a first class or an alist type of film wan however proves that its possible to rebuild dceu to a quality film onpar with mcu kudos to mr wan because moving towards a right direction after flops from justice league 2017 bvs 2016 and man of steel 2013 i can guarantee that any dc fanboy will love film and possibly they will cry because of the mind blown cinematic experience 2018 is best rated film soft reboot after the dark knight 2008 a 10 year progressioni like the myth of atlantis the idea of an advanced utopian civilization is intriguing some people view atlantis as fiction while others believed its real the mystery around it makes me think deeply there could be a technological advancement that was wiped in history  nothing is lasting foreverim not superheroescomic fanboy but is a type of movie youll never miss is one of the masterpiece from dceu an emotional ride and a family drama james wan nailed it thank you james wan im not interested to spoil it so go watch it now ,fantasy
lots of cringe and bits just added in too many stories going on at once but still the best dc film made in ages,fantasy
poor poor has there ever been a more maligned ridiculed character in comic hero history as a member of televisions super friends he was the least used or seen although he has been around since the early 40s and even spawned a more popular marvel ripoff namor he is probably been one of the least popular super heroes in comics having canceled title after canceled title even raj one of the comic loving guys from the big bang theory famously said sucks but in recent years writers have taken him more seriously making him more powerful and even gaining the publics respect in justice league he was one of the bright spots in the film and because of it he gets his own solo film i never thought i would see the day when would have his very own major motion picture but it is now out the question is can it help the fledgling dc movie universe or forgive the pun sink itwe learn thata parents were from different worlds his father a lighthouse keeper from main and his mother the princess of the underwater nation of atlantis he discovers her on the rocks on the seashore badly wounded after nursing her back to health the two fall in love and they have a son arthur when arthur is an infant they are attacked by soldiers from atlantis and his mother is forced to abandon her family and return to atlantis as arthur grows he discovers he has powers to communicate with the creatures from the seas he is taught by his mothers loyal advisor nuidis vulko who trains arthur to become a warrior but is rejected by the people of atlantis because he is a halfbreed after the events of justice league arthur has become a celebrity of sorts and considered a hero in the eyes of many on the surface but arthurs halfbrother orm hails himself as ocean master and plans to build an army consisting of the armies of the 7 seas to destroy the surface dwellers for the harm they have caused to the oceans of the world the daughter of one of the armys leader mera reaches out to to help her stop his brother and reclaim his rightful birthright as king of atlantis is a film that suffers from illusions of grandeur it wants to be an epic superhero movie but it grinds itself down with silly and clich scenes and characters it often tries too hard to be an impressive alltime great superhero movie and ends up becoming laughable and overthetop director james wan who is best known for his horror films like the conjuring and saw gives us too many jump scares for a superhero movie i counted four scenes in where a huge explosion or a monster was supposed to incite a reaction from moviegoers but if you can get through some of the films major weaknesses there is a true gem in this film jason momoa the hawaiian actor is a star in the making just like gal godot from wonder woman the producers found a relatively unknown actor and gave him a role that will define him for awhile and one that he brings a lot of charisma and natural screen presence to momoa can be funny truly entertaining without really trying early in the film he has some great fight scenes which is what he excels at as an action star the script is not always the strongest but momoa makes the best with what he is given amber heard is also strong as mera but some of the other supporting performers are oddly cast with veteran capable actors like willem dafoe  nicole kidman seeming like they are out of sorts and maybe uncomfortable in this film patrick wilson as the main villain orm isnt bad but he also wont go down as one of the best comic villains of film most exciting is black manta a personal favorite of mine who also provides one of the films best scenes with his fight against i really wished he was the main villain but i have a feeling if there is a sequel we will see him again the art direction and special effects are also a strength and the money they spent on those aspects were well spent but like so many popcorn films if they had just delivered on a stronger script this film could have been something special is not the strongest film of its genre even though it really tries it has a great actor to build a solid series around if they can just come up with a better script instead of going with old tired plots and ideals i would suggest they make it simple  subtle not loud  predictable i had a good enough time to recommend this film for a matinee but you may find yourself rolling your eyes from time to time no raj doesnt suck but his writers do,fantasy
i went to see the movie with high hopes and expectations  i dare say that it was far more than ive expected and hoped for  where to start  the charming cast  the concrete plot  the breathtaking visual effects and cgi  the great combination of adventure and action  also it is fun to watch  it was brilliant  i hope that wb gives jwan more opportunists to direct any upcoming dceu movie  and more budget too  i can as a dc fan that this man is our main man ,fantasy
when see trailer on youtube i though the movie will boring until i see it i love it the trailer was only show small story this movie better than all marvell movie,fantasy
phew one of the worst movies i have seen and times of india gave it a 355 star,fantasy
really really pathetic its like they took every superhero movie trope infantilised them and then smacked them together in a movielove jason momoa but definitely not strong enough to carry his own movie hes a sidekick with some great one liners and nothing morebut i think the thing that really lets the movie down is the cgi very cartoonish its like green lantern only slightly betteralthough im obsessed with amber heards hair,fantasy
the best thing about this is that it is a fast paced paced light hearted adventure under water the action gets used in the best way and the film is full of it with all sort of different action jason mamoa brings to life and the side characters all bring great performancesone thing i will say is the plot is very similar to black panther and the emotional moments dont hit as hard as they should,fantasy
boredom is the name of this film i thought at the start it was good then it got silly go to the pub,fantasy
too little story and substance and too much war and fighting,fantasy
i am so confused by the praise this film has receivedsub par acting cgi that looked like it was from a ps2 game action shots that felt like old power rangers episodesnot worth your time,fantasy
this movie is the worst of all the dcu movies shouldve stopped at man of steel please can someone teach jason momoa how to act,fantasy
jango fett  cgi nicole kidman its just not that good of a movie like all dc movies its dark literally someone needs to tell dc that walmart still sells light bulbs,fantasy
totally loved this movie i was sceptical but with effects attention to detail and great storyline nailed it the only character i couldnt gel with was black mantra i believe he would have been perfect in another movie with just felt as though that was an extra storyline this film didnt need,fantasy
im 40 i grew up on comics and as i grew up i moved graphic novels before finally being given the mcu and the start of my love affair with superheroes on filmthis movies wasnt made for me it wasnt for someone interested in superheroes for the characters the great complicated story lines the always in the background morality of great power and what you do with itthis movie had none of that is like a teenager whos being forced to clean his room nothing he does is because he feels he wants to or because he should do or because he cares about something that may be a little unfair i think his motivation is wanting to look coolthe script is terrible the acting is sub par the plot doesnt make sense the movie jumps around but offers no final conclusion that tie it together like most movies that jump aroundjust a rush job cgi fest with no plot that attempts to coincide money from the superhero dollar created in the last 10 years,fantasy
clearly dc has no chance because either the executives of the movie companies or the chosen directors have no clue how to follow the comics i dont know who is to blame but aqua man starts out like a rushed product by those who got into the movie producing business by their parents because clearly the dc movies including this crap could not have been orchestrated by people with merits the opening scenes in the submarine just sunk this movie from the get go a mercenary that vows revenge on the main character because his father traps himself they try to start a plot and it fails from the start then the eventual war within the fish ranks oh and the acting is horrible but not as bad as the corny lines just a simple movie for simple minded people,fantasy
nice cgi which must have looked great at an imax that asidewhat do i do in this scene fight that guy over there what do i do in this scene fight those guys over there ad nauseumthere is a plot there somewhere although what is it or may be rapidly reaches a who caresmore clichs than you can shake a stick at ooh didnt see that dreadful bit of dialogue coming oy you at least try and act a nice payday for willem dafoe who manages to look as bewildered by it all rather wellsummaryermermnoisy cgi soaked fight feat,fantasy
dragged out story nicole kidman looked like a wax work dummy too many unimportant charaters,fantasy
and for a superhero movie it seems better than the routine drivel thats out there i just couldnt get past the dopey effects generic bad guys maybe its great for kids or people who dont expect much out of movies but i couldnt get past the first 70 minutes even though i wanted to,fantasy
was disappointed that this movie was not better as i expected far more than what i saw as many others have reviewed this movie i will keep mine short the two biggest issues i had were the casting choices of kidman and wilson and the length i like kidman as an actress but feel she is only in here for face recognition due to the many low level poor actors used a waste of her talent patrick wilson is so far from a believable villain as to be almost a parody of himself i realize that there are probably a lot of a list actors that dont want anything to do with some of the super hero movies but there must have been someone that could have been more threatening my second beef is with the length of the movie no reason at all for this to run almost 2 12 hours not enough story to fill that timeto end on a positive note some of the special effects are pretty decent,fantasy
the corniest movie i have ever seen i could go on a rant but ill spare you all do not watch,fantasy
it was a real struggle to finish watching way worse than i ever imagined it to be,fantasy
wachowski part 2 oh em gee if jason momoa does 2 he better ask for 20 million they got a guy from spiderman to be in the movie must be under contract horrible movie horribledolf lungrand another cash grab from expendables three jason please scrap to dont do it please dont do it listen to jada pinkett smith and dont do it in the movie they had turtles and whales down deep in the ocean hauling freight but their air breathers surely theyre appealing to the liberal tree huggers also the waste appearing on shore jason appeal to your humanitarian side and dont to 2  this movie was weird stupid,fantasy
way too predictable and clich didnt laugh once acting was mediocre the graphicsartwork were really amazing however maybe im giving it more than it deserves with a 610,fantasy
this film is highlighted by spectacular visual effects and production design but unfortunately starts to look and feel like almost every other big budget super hero film to come down the track in the past 10 years the battle scenes are redundant and everyone just looks so shiny and bright the script is overwrought with melodrama and lame humour and the acting is just okay i never cared for in comic book form and this movie doesnt really make me feel that much better about the character,fantasy
this movie was trying hard to be thor ragnorak type and its not a bad thing fans havent liked dark and different tone of dceu before so a course correction is fine this movie works because of the slick direction of james wan and charming performance of jason momoai was so hesitant before justice league after hearing the new news of the casting of and i didnt like persona dc tried to show in jl trailers but he was amazing in the movie one of the saving grace in the 3rd acteven then i wasnt much excited for this movie but it turned out to be way better than my expectations this movie is fastpaced lighthearted and colorful everything dceu needsyes people can say this movie is silly but if this movie would have taken of all characters too seriously it could have been man of steel 2it was an entertaining movie which i can see again once blueray comes uprating 6meaning good but might not watch it again,fantasy
the story line was decent it was kind of cliche to be honest but the visual effects were shocking and astounding brother v brother for the thrown of atlantis,fantasy
well i would have rated it 8 but the reason of giving it 7 is that the weapons in the movie  plasma guns etc seem like toys  only the trydant seems a bit good and logical although the story is great also the romance in the movie is great,fantasy
tom reads hp lovecraftthats a collapsed chestthey found an atlantean betamaxthese aholes love to explode into a roomthe jellyfish have excellent seatsi like the tale of the tape in underwater neonthat is a lot of creaturesshe couldnt give him some intel before he entersif do right no can defense,fantasy
while the dceu does have its fair share of stinkers is not one of them it has an interesting story set after justice league where arthur curry who is now known to the people as the goes on a journey to atlantis to stop a deadly war between the oceans and the surface by his halfbrother orm while discovering his true destiny the characters are good as well is basically a fish out of water who is clueless about his true role while mera is a great heroine who aids him in his search orm is a good main antagonist while black manta is brought in as a secondary villain and has a good fight with and while the movie does have so much special effects they are put to good use especially for the underwater segments this is a good movie and is worth watching,fantasy
i have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score let alone 10 after 20 minutes i have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show but damn this movie is way too dumb character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues jokes feel like they are just out of place but specific moments are created just for them to happen which makes it even more ridiculous there are some really stunning shots but its more of an exception rather than the rule but the main issue which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer is the fact that its linear as hell there are 0 unpredictable plot twists from the beginning of the movie or even from trailers you for sure know how its going to end also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent at some points characters are dead serious while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes its not as bad as in justice league but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face wb u evil corporate idiots stop ruining your movies by trying to be like marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesnt work it just looks like a parody and not a well done one,fantasy
its only purpose is to setup the next movie it makes no effort to be a good stand alone movie is a flat and onedimensional character with a predictable journey which is fine the only problem is the villains and supporting cast are more boring than him i cant really remember the things i liked about it because its a pretty forgettable movie experience its not a bad movie  la justice league but its not a good movie either  la wonder woman its a competent movie,fantasy
the movie looks like an animation film there is too much cgi and everything looks like computer graphics no scene looks believable or real a flying superman or a batman with superhuman strength looked believable but these underwater fights are a caricature of special effects and this kind of cinema,fantasy
a bunch of vfx scenes scrambled together on the basis of jason momoas charisma boring tripe even for lovers of dc and marvel comic adaptations move on,fantasy
no idea how a sane person can produce such a non sense story almost every scene was a wtf moment to me,fantasy
very good screen play movie is full of action drama and little bit comedy worth watching it action in movie is too fast for 3d viewers,fantasy
it was my 2nd time trying to watch the movie and i stopped at the middle of it is it just me or it gives you the twilight vibe extremely superficial acting plot holes quick scenec that have no meaning cliches  poor casting choice with miss kidmani really wanted to like this thats why it was my 2nd try,fantasy
i gave 210 because of momoa the main character if he would not be in the film i would give 110 the movie is full of cliches from movies already existing mix everything put it under water take momoa and your done you got it is just funny that we humans reinvent the wheel way too often with movies like this its just terrible horrible and not the least boring i dontknow i feel like i have just wasted 25 hours of my life never watch this ever,fantasy
ok we expected to see a cool movie with a super hero but instead we got with superpowers in unbelievable movie settings boring storyline and really sorry bad special effects the only good thing about this movie wasnicole kidman she looks beautiful sorry to say but we fell both a sleep this was a waist of our time next time better,fantasy
fishman utilizes oversized fork to rule over all sea creatures,fantasy
 of dc comics finally gets his top billing in a film as the nicely put together jason momoa plays the title role in this science fiction epic already asequel is in the works in fact this film ends on an uncertain note setting up thestory line for the sequellighthouse keeper temura morrison finds a woman with a trident on his beachand takes her in nicole kidman is the woman and shes the queen of the undersea kingdom of atlantis and shes running away from all that the two fall inlove and have a kid who grows up to be jason momoabut before that some atlantian warriors show up and try to kidnap kidmantheyre all killed but kidman decides to go back lest more come and harm hersonone would have to be blind not to miss the parallels between the story of thesword and the stone and momoas earth name is arthur curry forthat matter now all grown up and quite fit and cut hes summoned to atlantis to claim the crown but first he has to find a magical trident stuck in a rocksomewhere in the sea can it get plainer than that also has a surface enemy in the son of a pirate whose father he killedwhen they were capturing a submarinei did like the computer graphic special effectsused and loved the fantasy seaworld that was createdi can hardly wait for the sequel,fantasy
dont bother with this movie the story is garbage the acting is terrible how is jason momoa famous and the action scenes endlessly drag on if i could give it 0 stars i would maybe even negative stars save ur money save ur time save ur eyes this is a complete waste of money i literally walked out on this youd have to pay me 10 million to even finish it please no fn sequel,fantasy
maybe was not meant for full grown adults but i cannot say the special effects were great either at least not on my high definition tv which revealed too much green screen effects and outlines and even thin wires sometimeswe liked the actors in general but perhaps the flood of super hero movies out there have made us numb and more critical most of them are rubbish nonsense but have to say that story lines wasnt too bad in comparison,fantasy
from the ridiculous guitar riffs when ever momoa does anything in the first 5 minutes to the awful costumes this film is just not upto muchhas a very power rangers style approach to the wardrobe the cg is crude in parts the plot is basic and predictable its a joke that dc are putting things like this out after some of the recent marvel films they should be embarrassed with themselveswatchable but nothing more,fantasy
i wanted to like this but yet another dc disappointment,fantasy
seems like a stereotypical superhero movie but when watching the movie it feels intentional,fantasy
ossw directory from the director and vfx were also good but acting of main characters could be better than that,fantasy
i didnt believe the reviews i watched it anyway i got exactly what i expected out of a dc movie  terrible writing i mean you think im supposed to care about what happens to an awful person who murders innocent people but he killed my dad1 goofy cgi although very colorful and creative and laughable dialogue not in a good way i just dont understand how dc just cant quite capture the lightning and write a good story a bad guy who wants to take over the world is just not enough anymore  dc is stuck in 1997 as far as their writing is concernedbut the biggest disappointment is the dude himself it feels like the writers were like ehhh just make something up and he adlibbed half of his dialogueand it was goofy even in context i realizedjason momoa seems like a great person and i like him but dude is a mediocre actorits a silly movie that doesnt decide whether its campy ridiculous or serious action and it loses the game at both,fantasy
 is an alright movie which relies solely on its breathtaking visuals to maintain the audiences interest the camerawork is kinetic  inventive  brings a real sense of liveliness to the sequences which are expertly choreographed  shot together harmoniously as are the enormous battles  akin to james camerons avatar or star wars set underwater the visual effects are groundbreaking mindblowing  in abundance throughout  shot in a beautiful imax ratio that captures the scale of the films multiple setpieces but unfortunately besides that all the movie really offers is just mindless visual spectaclegranted the worldbuilding is impressive  the costume  set design really are a sight to behold but all of these things simply add to the slightly superficial feel purely aestheticwont however deny it it was fun to sit through  its watchable   jason momoa  amber heard have great onscreen chemistry but that doesnt excuse the paper thin plot  its total lack of substance underneath not to mention the plot conveniences which had my eyes rolling the cringey choices of music wasted villain with great potential weird score forced humour  oneliners etcits messy convoluted inconsistent  tries desperately to distract you from these flaws with its only reliable strength or selling point the cgi,fantasy
its a typical dc movie in the line of superman wonderwoman and the latest badman movies its enjoyable to watch with actionpacked scenes no surprises or plottwists no real character back stories and the storyline is that of badguys vs goodguys so i rate it 6 out of 10 because some actionscenes i really enjoyed,fantasy
theres a lot of worthy praise about this movies visuals and action sequences the movie really is stunning some incredible visuals truly that being said thats about all thats praiseworthy about the character and plot development is either rushed or sorely lacking it really left me hurting for more not in a good way a few of the oneliners made me chuckle but most made me cringe or groan the dialogue is poor and the story seems hastily patched together amidst a deluge of action sceneshonestly i was most disappointed because of the incredible potential of this material wan really showed incredible imagination he just crammed way too much into one movie the incredible potential for atlantis worldbuilding is clearly there but its just blasted through at such a wastefully fast pace theres enough content for three movies crammed into a span of two and a half hourspicture this spoilers ahead the first film could have simply introduced and black manta two origin stories as the core of the film this would allow more time for proper character and plot development glimpses of the atlantis culture could be included meras character could begin investigating this halfbreed assisting with his battle against black manta and the end of the film would tease the unrest of the seven kingdomsfilm two the war of the seven kingdoms begins is not crowned king yet but still plays a vital role in protecting the surfacedwelling world perhaps orm remains prince a minor antagonist and his father still alive is the primary antagonist that stirs conflict this allows so much more time for worldbuilding and character development for these amazing seven kingdomspotential film three orm becomes the main antagonist after the defeat of his father in film two and stirs conflict again in the seven kingdoms journeys to the trench to discover his mother claim the trident and become king ending the conflict defeating orm and bringing peace to atlantisthis is just spitballing but my point is that this movie covered way too much content in one sitting such a waste so much potential so much imagination just horribly paced i had no time to really digest or appreciate anything since it was flying by at the speed of light justice league suffered from the same issue trying to accomplish too much in one film,fantasy
i wanted so bad to like this movie but its just not a good movie the storyline is very predictable and the acting was really bad it was like watching a power rangers movie but for adults i might have enjoyed watching a power rangers movie more than this crap film,fantasy
thats about all i can say thats original about this movie well the visuals and some imaginative scenestrite dialogue and a stereotypical plot line lots of mindless action and id have expected better from some of the actors who were in the filmits a good film for a 13 year old boy regardless of his chronological age something to keep him entertained for 2 12 hours,fantasy
i had to forse myself to suffer through most of it and ended up feeling like i should sue the cable company for selling crap like that and robbing me of two hours of time that could have been used to start counting the blades of grass in my lawn thankfully i was able to fast forwarded most of the pointless battle scenes,fantasy
marvel has thor and he was larger than life at least while those charming blond curls lasted disney has frozen and it was all over the place what could have dc done to prove that its them who must be the most shiny and sparkling princesses of this realm the answer is to make the most epic film everimagine putting together star wars indiana jones avatar black panther the lord of the rings tron blade runner hunger games mission impossible fifth element gi joe king arthur jurassic park and even shrek to spruce things up a bit then crumb a ton of lesser blockbusters and blockbuster wannabes on top sounds terrific but will it blend of course it will with the new warnerbro 3000 we could mill this into a uniform finegrained mess with giant seahorses roaring sharks and blasterwielding steampunk dudes bestriding themsome superhero films at least have the decency to pretend to have some sense about them before plunging into the abyss of brainconvulsing insanity but not wants to be a superman x deadpool both unparalleledly badass and unbelievably corny is a champion of heavy submarinelifting and a wizard of cheesy oneliners flies jumps he does all but sing italian opera under the sea  and for that omission alone im indeed gratefulbeing a total selfbelittling goofus was maybe the only point of indulgence for the himself so at least we dont have to try to watch this farce with serious faces like we had to with the latest batman and superman movies maybe if i was a woman id find some another redeeming point about this movie but seriously if you just want to watch jason momoa look all buff watch that conan film instead you would feel much smarter while you do watch this however if youve been sitting in a dark cellar for the last fifty years and you want to recall what colors and moving objects look like you might even be surprised by the not so delicately delivered ecological message  and start reducing reusing and recycling right awayand if you do please go ahead and recycle this trash first it would make a better confetti filler than it had made a screen one,fantasy
this movie is alright but isnt really special like venom is i know venom and are different universes but just comparing it to a similar superherobased movie from around the same time i always thought chris hemsworth would make the best even though hes already thor but i guess this guy didnt do such a bad job it is what it is but its not as epic as i expected,fantasy
it was horrible acting his mother is an adulterer he steals his brothers fiancee it should be called adultery man poorly written dung for the low iq,fantasy
atrocious acting reminiscent of arnys dr freeze special effects looked under funded trying to make the father look younger you could easily see his fake hairline unbelievably unfunny one liners im missing happy hour i thought they were trying to revive dc but it seems they just threw a trident right through it batman  robin has a 37 it wasnt quite that bad so heres a 4,fantasy
again dc movies writers couldnt write a decent script the dialogues are so stupid and pretentious and frankly the protagonist is this big guy who never learn how to act this movie is such a poorly thought cgi parade unappealing plot and such a waste of time,fantasy
i dont think jason momoa is capable of memorizing more than six words at a time,fantasy
is this a movie or whatpity for those who rate this 10 out of 10,fantasy
let me serve you the starter has hollywood ever seen a redhead before ambers hair color as awful as she is i guess they bought it straight from 711 on the other hand it pretty much matches her acting skillshow about that score my ears were bleeding is it a random spotifys list wouldnt be surprised thoughwhat would do if i could write the screenplaycreating the layers for the story by focusing on each kingdom there are lots of potentialsp over there thatd be great to see epic fights and diplomacy rather than hey lets fight type of scenesid focus on past events what happened to the queen how does she manage to get another child did she make it with the king on the way to her executionid leave that pirate out of the scenario and bring him back on another movie rather than portraying him that wayid shape the score around a theme like icelandic folk as they used in the beginningi gave that 5 for the one who chose jason as an,fantasy
arthur is the heir apparant to a subaquean dynasty ruling a society that is a smorgasbord of fustian and fantasy despite being born to out of wedlock to a mother in exile from the feudal kingdom to which she belongs thus setting the standard of inconsistancy that permeates the plot throughout the movienicole kidman as the queen should that be princess if her father is still king does lift the movie out of the normal bland macho bravado dialogue and action that takes place as our hero battles his way from one perilous incident to the next its a pity she is dead oh wait now she isnt inconsistant againour hero is a very predictable impervious superman who can leap thousands of feet out of an airplane whithout a parachute but struggles on a twostorey roof in italy watch as he boldly goes where almost no subaquean halfhuman has gone beforeborrowed from other genres a submarine seizure james bond power rangers sea monsters godzilla and lord of the rings domesticated sea creatures finding nemo even arthur himself is described as more or less as the once and future king  king arthur of the britons of the round table famenothing original is noticed here,fantasy
imdb critics have gone crazy 72 for this foul mug aesthetically the film is obnoxious floating hair actors to decorations its like in a syfy production the humor is totally stupid and not funny the actors are bad as all poor willem dafoe whose face rejuvenated creates a deep discomfort the scenes with manta recalls the worst hours of power rangers there is no scenario the music plundered without shame and coherence of the textures heard elsewhere to appreciate this show you must never have seen any film or totally lost reason its not even a guilty pleasure,fantasy
i really enjoyed watching this was anxiously awaiting for how it was going to turn out to be and wasnt disappointed dc ,fantasy
 to call this movie big is an understatement has damn near everything isnt like most other superhero movies now gets his own originstory showcase in the dc extended universe just go for it ,fantasy
this review was written on dec 22 2018i got home and turned on my laptop specifically to write this in one word this movie is beautifulhands down it is the best thing that happened to the dc universe since nolans batman trilogy the story is very well robust the actors are perfectly chosen thanks zneyder and the graphics magnificentlet me start by saying i am a big geek of ancient history and mythology atlantis and its legends instill in me a feeling of mystery and an intrigue that always make me contemplate the fantasies of its existence this movie simply stirs up those feelings and takes you to the lost throne explaining its majesty its rise its demise and now its renaissancethe story has a beautiful path every sequence is well justified and so well connected that universe is well establishedthe chemistry between the characters also flows so naturally that nothing seems forced or unexplainedwithout adding any spoilers despite my reservation of its completely happy ending i will end by saying that indeed appears to be the hero who has lifted the dceu from its years in the abyss the movie that holds the dc universe to its rightful place among the legendsalso everything i need by skylar grey is truly a masterpiece a beautiful ending to a great moviebravo james wan,fantasy
people always criticize dc for there content and not equal to marvel but this movie is worth to watch bcoz the way they show the world underneath water is so beautiful screenplay  acting vfx casting everything is perfect  now dc also have rival in beauty of scarlett johansson black widow ie amber heard mera,fantasy
what is it with dc and trying to put so many stories in one movie the black manta storyline goes nowhere and is totally pointless they could have saved this classic villain for another film instead of diluting his contribution in this the only saving grace was mamoas performance as other than that this movie is not anywhere near to meeting expectations disappointing,fantasy
you dont necessarily have to be a fan of superhero movies but it helps if you watch it looks like theyre going to make a movie of every possible comic character and i have no problem with that as long as im entertained based on a dc comic this time is for the major part just cgis like most of those movies there are some terrific action scenes but sometimes the cgis looked also a bit fake that would be the only minor point to me as for the rest the story is easy to watch and has a high entertainment level jason momoa is candy for the eye for women if i have to believe my wife like amber heard is candy for the eye for men and nicole kidman looks like she never ages the botox did help in her case its obvious there will be more movies in the future and im fine with that,fantasy
its actually really really gooddc shouldve started with thisit had lots of exciting moments,fantasy
the problem with all those superheroes flicks and their spinoffs is the fact that most flicks are way too long and do have a mediocre storyline did i like this one surethe story is great the effects are stunning and even clocking in over 2 hours its still full with action one moment i thought omg not that famous kiss and dont let it be a love story luckily it isnt theres a bit of liove but destroyed with actionabout the story itself i cant say a thing because its easy to catch and i would spoil a lot great to see amber heard again and a bit of a joke here and theregore 05nudity 05effects 55story 45comedy 05,fantasy
arthur goes on a journey of selfdiscovery to claim his rightful place as the true ruler of the seas this is what i expected and it is exactly what i got so i am not at all disappointed it is a fun movie although a little pretentious at times,fantasy
no sense what so ever in the story the characters are badly built the effects the end the beginning the easy jokes the bad jokes do not waste your time please this is not scify fantasy marvel dc nothing,fantasy
i watch 90 minutes then i got so bored that stopped watching i continued the next day and still was disappointed when the movie ended,fantasy
the movie is weird from every angle like super advanced atlantis kings fight with trident and these tridents are made up with steel half of the story is harry potter is featured in international news but no one knows him outside a bar near his hometown a little town of italy is raged by unusual forces yet not a normal human dies and the hero has no weakness like he is violently beaten almost to death and then saved by sea weed the mother never ages and the red headed heroine needed a diesel engine small ship to cross oceans in one minute and every sunrisesunset scenes has so poor vfx that it belongs to atlantis age black panther is much scientific and enjoyable movie is a movie which is just made because it had to be made,fantasy
stories a wee bit funny eh in desertreally underwater bubble speech cant understand guys beautiful sfxso stop pouring money in the way it looks and shove it in the story outie,fantasy
full of old and lame cliches but we love cliches dont we,fantasy
as i was watching this i observed many elements of some of my favourite scifi films watch for elements that remind you of the matrix tron king kong the phantom menace and attack of the clones just to name a fewvery strong supporting cast and momoa carried the film very welli went into this knowing nothing about and the explanation of the backstory was well done and not overly longall in all a pleasant surprisevery very high production standardsps amber heard looks very good wetpps so does nicole kidman,fantasy
i want to say first that this movie is visually stunning the acting is good but the fight scenes and action sequences had me glued to the movieok so heres one of my remaining questions follow me down the rabbit hole for a second in the opening russian sub scene black manta receives his grandfathers knife then while battling black manga tries to uses human made steel but can not injure him after receiving the armor and confronting black manta reveals that he now has atlantian steel a few frames later he tries to wield his grandfathers blade on and cuts him deep sodoes black mantas backstory have an atlantian connection,fantasy
i have to think the movie was just the wrong vechcile for i enjoyed his character in justice league but it just doesnt work here,fantasy
i just had a hard time connecting to this film the story is rubbish its rushed and not interesting at all the acting is mostly unconvincing no chemistry between characters and the humor attempts are awful the pirate addition is absolute rubbish too some scenes are ridiculous like momoa and amber emerging from the waves to the sound of rap music or momoa fighting a bunch of power rangers monsters in an italian village on the positive side all shots underwater  are quite cool to watch and the scenary is beautiful and colorful i didnt see this at the movies but if i did i am not sure i would put up with it until the end see thor ragnarok a 2nd or 3rd time instead of this you wont regret it,fantasy
was waiting for this one loved it i am a big superhero movieseries fan doesnt matter if it is marvel dc or any other superhero type and like always it was superb great cast excellent directing in the way of james wan brilliant work sir thank you dc and all involve again loved itand oh the sensitive world we now live in had to spoil it with some negative reviews i suppose we are all entitled to our own opinions but people please lets get real if you want to see real events and real emotions just watch the news i am really surprised to see all the bad reviews movies like these are getting nowadays come on people we have enough tragedy and horror in real life going to the movies or watching it at home on the big screen lcd should be to get away from all your troubles and enjoying yourself and what better kind of movie than i watch movies for the thrill excitement big screen action and of course a few tears here and there never hurt so what i am saying is we need movies to be entertaining does exactly that,fantasy
was really excited to watch this movie but i was utterly disappointeddialogue was so cringey i was close to covering my ears i really really wanted to like this movie but the story arcs were just so senseless i couldnt wait to get out of the cinema they tried too hard to inject humor into the dialogue that it was painful to hear how obvious they tried to copy the marvel movies ocean master  no just no why people rated this movie so high was likely all cause of the hype and ofcourse jason mamoa who we all loved in game of thrones but sorry not sorry this movie is trash and i wish they did a better job like they had with wonder woman the only thing i liked about watching this movie was that it ended,fantasy
its everything you can expect from a dc universe release but nothing more great special effects and lots of action with a decent predictable plot my only true complaint was the chemistry between jason momoa and amber heard there was no chemistry at all and any attempts to create chemistry seemed forced at no point did i feel like there was any connection between the two and it seems they were only tolerating each other overall it was a very entertaining movie but did not break any barriers,fantasy
b movie was hoping for some enchantment of atlantis with special effects like in avatar not atlantis was like a busy nyc street with garish lights and displayed colored buildings crowded noisy complicated to the senses not well done at all acting was subpar all around like figures were just reading their lines and not feeling their lines then add confusion to the mix and too many battles,fantasy
dc finally found a director who knew what to say and could finish it properly hopefully dc wont always think about filming the nth dark knight in the future its a dead end although the idea imitates space science fiction it must be said that special effects especially large battle scenes are very beautiful its just that the story is told in a hurry including two villains but the level is not clear,fantasy
 isnt perfect bit too long but the colors and fighting sequences in this movie are awesome helps right the ship for the dceu,fantasy
i really enjoyed this film jason mamoa brings a great amount of swagger to the role i liked amber heards role and the importance of her character in the plot the action scenes were really good and added tension to the plot this added a real touch to the proceedings unlike some recent superhero movies where either you dont care about the actor or the action never really poses a thread to the hero the world building is not overdone and fit perfectly the only drawback was that some plot points involving king orm were rushed which makes me reduce my rating by one,fantasy
great moviethe best movie from dcso hyped for the coming movies,fantasy
this movie is nothing but a mimic of power rangers baby style in making movies horrible plot and directingi cringe so hard every time they try to make some hype moments,fantasy
ill be honest i laughed multiple times throughout the movie after crazy events because it was so predictable honestly the jokes are terrible the acting is tough because their lines would be better fit for a high school playsave your money and search elsewhere,fantasy
this is definitely power rangers meets hercules meets avatar or labyrinth or never ending story or some other bizzare kids film like willowthe baddies look like cheap glitzytoys that your 4 year old would play withdolph lundgren tough guy he man has never looked so gayterrible terrible film dont even know where im getting 4 stars from perhaps for amber heard looking all katy perryor the little mermaidskip this one,fantasy
i was super excited for this movie after reading all the hyped up reviews and extravagant praise for the visual effects but i was totally disappointed and left flabbergasted in the most brutal way possible after seeing jason momoas dialogue delivery and terrible comic timing for that matter even serious dialogues i am glad jason momoa aka khal drogo did not have any dialogues in goti mean come on dc it really is time for you guys to up the ante and become serious contenders to mcu so far mcu is way ahead of dcjust after 10 mins into the movie i was feeling so bored and asleep it was a torture chamber for me poor acting poor dialogues poor expressions worst comic timing from each and every single character of the movievisual affects were the only positive thing about the whole movie i highly recommend not to watch this highly over rated movie,fantasy
one thing i can finally say dc finally has it right with wonder woman and now under their belts the special effects were astonishing in this movie the way they made you believe they were really under water and breathing the scope of the movie was amazing and the story held your interest i would have rated it a 10 but here comes the but the vilian and men in the submarine their acting and parts to me were flawed for me this is where it became cheesy and none of it just didnt seem to fit in fact i think just leaving the villian being the brother would have worked fine for the movie the whole submarine bit in the beginnning and the making of the vilian because left his dad to die just didnt work or seem to fit for me this is something that they could have done better with if they wanted it to work it just seemed to be a side bar that doesnt fit in the scheme of things if they had done it up better or just left this out then for me it would have been an easy 10 otherwise a great addition to the dc family and one i would recommend to go see if you havent,fantasy
i wasnt a dc fan so far but this movie should be on the top of the superhero movies tops the visuals are stunning the music is wonderful great actors and characters good storyline the movie was well made it had great rhythm entertaining till the end i think jason momoa did justice to noone else wouldnt be better i saw the movie like several times there are always details that i havent notice before its just so captivating,fantasy
this review contains spoilers is a superhero movie directed by justin lin the movie based off of the dc comics character the movie stars jason mamoa in the titular role amber heard plays an atlantean that assists in claiming his destiny is an incredibly silly movie this movie does not take itself seriously there are many scenes in this moine that have ridiculous visuals or soundtracks two examples is an octopus playing the drums and the song africa played once the two leading characters are flying over africa there is no way that this movie is meant to be taken seriously this also makes the movie more entertaining as a result the movie does not restrict itself to the serious in justice league which makes this movie have a lighter tonethe story in this movie is nonexistent the plot is only an excuse to have dazzling set pieces and impressive visuals the movie tells arthur curry or aqnamans story from his mothers affair with his father and his youth there is much in this movie that felt like filler or an excuse to show cool effects or costumes the flashback scenes to arthur currys youth felt bloated even if it is fitting for the story the story and characters are all bloated as the story stays simple even the villain that is introduced at the beginning of the movie becomes utterly irrelevant towards the end the manta had no purpose at all to the overall plotthe visuals are the best part of this movie the movies effort and budget clearly went to this part of the movie every scene has fantastic visuals i was surprised that every scene had better visuals than the last the scenes have these great effects and costumes not only that but the direction by justin lin makes the action scenes much more exciting there is frequently a 360 degrees turn as the action moves on the screen the movie has so many great action scenes that it makes the movie worthwhile to watch there is no awesome action scene but many small action scenes the action scenes are one of the reasons to watch this movie the other reason is the funny scripti would recommend although the movie has its flaws the sharp humor and great visuals are worth the price of admissionthree stars out of four stars for,fantasy
tone script  story the story is about how ruler of water world comes into existence a fate a war with land dwellers is in his hands when he comes to power the movie portrays an above average storydirection screenplay cinematography the biggest strength of the movie is its visuals the ones at the end are spectacular the ones on land too are very good for me the ones in ocean were crowdie and blurry the same appeared when i saw finding nemo i guess that happened to portray a reality in the sea more precisely i wished if they were clear even after being in ocean despite that they were nice this movie was first of its kind given to us by director james wan it was a nice job most of his earlier work circulated around horror genremusic above average acting justifiedfinal verdict it is a visual extravaganza if you can watch it opt for a big screen,fantasy
ive just gotten home from the theater and was wowed by the movie the actors except dafoe and lundgren are new to me so they had the appeal of not comparing them to other roles flash gordon was the first thing to mind after seeing the fishermen trench familiar twolegged atlanteans and so forth in the matter of undersea races  all it needed was the hawkmeni just loved it and didnt expect it to be a power couple movie at all but then i stopped reading comics about four years back so maybe the latest comics do more with mera anyway momoa in addition to being smoking hot did okay as he rushed his lines a little once or twice yet held up in the dramatic and romantic moments the effects couldnt have been better either seamlessly sliding from land to water atlantis was perfectly composed since became my first superhero love in the silver age not superman or batman or any other man this was a happy 2 hours and 23 minutes recognizing temuera morrison was the icing on the cake the aquarium scene with young arthur hailed back to a favorite panel from a long ago comic with arts hand the focus of multiple fish species attention ending costume couldnt have been betterspeaking of ending upon reading credits to nick cardy and mort weisinger my little ol fans heart beat faster,fantasy
he was in my case the basic motif for see the film i am too old for super heroes of american pop culture and the only desire about dc films is to convince me in this case the result is satisfactory because jason momoa sure cgi old cliches the trident and the wise guide the beautiful girl and the terrible enemy but except the effort of momoa to sustain in honorable way his character nothing new sure it is a simple dynamic cool film for fans and young public and it works but the too familiar it could be better remains present at the end not exactly as accusation but as a form of nostalgia about old fashion fantasy  action films sure it is heroic and propose a high noble powerful hero but something is missing what  maybe in essence the answer has no significance,fantasy
i have to say with a superhero movie i dont expect an oscar movie so keeping in mind what it is i was entertained great cinematography effects and some great acting talent i cant complain overdone a bit but when the subject is a character like what did you think we were getting,fantasy
i m shocked this is i thought itll be a good movie but it was very boring and poor dialogue the story line itself is not enough disappointedps i give it 6 because of jason my love the movie without him is like 4,fantasy
first things first what the hell is it with digging up actors in their 50s and 60s pumping them full of fillers botox and then digitally enhancing them does hollywood not have actors in their 20s any more i would estimate at least 50 of the characters are digitally airbrushed you know its got ridiculous when that granny 55 year old sandra bullock is cast as a 30 year old pregnant artist in bird box in nicole kidman has got the compulsory rigid duck pout top lip favoured by the likes of posh spice  i was surprised she could throw a spear at her age in the cameo part she had let alone have a baby are these actresses not embarrassed and amber heardseriouslywhat is she forwant to know how uninspiring isim typing this 45 minutes into it,fantasy
a nice movie the black manta villian reminds me of power ranger villans throwbacks to my childhood beautiful cgi and a powerful story also shows the atrocities of human beings on the ocean life thank you for the movie and a must watch,fantasy
i had so much fun with this filmdirector james wann has done a wonderful job,fantasy
as the title of my review suggests is saved from being a 2 star film by the effects which while sometimes being a bit ott are the best ive seen in a dc movie  not in the same league as marvel of course but a step on from previous dc offerings the real problems lie with the hackneyed story hero returns to his people overthrows evil brother takes his rightful place on the throne blah blah blah and the daytimesoap acting  yes amber heard im looking at you a tip for you ms heard dont ever share a screen with nicole kidman again  youve done it once now and it did you no favours against these two dealbreakers the mediocre script and odd soundtrack somehow fade into insignificance leaving the viewer feeling decidedly meh which is arguably the cruellest indictment of alldespite my opinion though im sure a sequel will appear and having seen the postcredits scene im pretty certain what the storyline will be  i just wont be watching it,fantasy
awful jokes ridiculously drawn out run time and a script that was so uninteresting that i couldnt help but zone out during the last 30 or so minutes the performance by jason momoa was a highlight along with an excellent final fight at times the plot was complete nonsense how did they get out of the desert why does the little girl hand mera the pinocchio book etc the action scenes felt ripped off the roof chase had been done in many many better films and at times i felt i was watching an animated movie due to the amount of cgiunderwhelming and very poor cant believe i payed money to see this,fantasy
the only good thing about this movie is jason mamoa and the hot redhead the plot if you can even call it that is hard to follow theres too much extra information and theres many plot holes i hate this but it was nice to look at jasons face thats two hours of my life ill never be able to get back ,fantasy
one time watchable only nothing more than an average movie,fantasy
while you are waiting for the time to pass and planning to watch a movie based on super hero that is then i most tell you you will get bored because of horrible direction and atrocious story,fantasy
this movie is a good movie dc really managed to make a cool superheroamber heard and jason momoa were funny and did a very good acting job and in general the whole cast played wellthe main reason to see this movie is however the cgi i mean wow it was really cool to look at it didnt seem fake it looked like everything that happend could have happend in real life somehowthe story line isnt like avengers infinity war where youre just left stunned but it is okey nothing wrong with itgood entertainment well woth a watch,fantasy
as i expected dc once more disappointed to quit on henry cavill as superman for this really they killed it with too much colors and visual effects like youre watching an animated movie in some points really tried to like it and ill watch it few more times but really shallow and clich movie mixture of indiana jones 20000 leagues under the sea journey to the center of the earth and many more only jack sparrow was missing dceu is quite dead,fantasy
this movie is visually beautiful all the underwater worlds are gorgeous unfortunately this doesnt make up for the overcrowded plot and super cheesy dialogue lot of eye rolls with the dialogue especially,fantasy
i didnt like the costumes except for and his mothers costume the rest were really cheaply made from a hideous plasticthey were many cringy momentsi liked jasons performance and the action especially in the beginingthe last battle was generic,fantasy
first of all based on the title what id like to praise about the movie is the direction the vfx and the acting i thought the direction and the acting waswere really good and the visuals were amazing this is definitely one of the best looking comic book movies it almost looks like a comic book that came to lifenow that all the positives are done let me tell you why i didnt like this movie first of all i just didnt like the protagonists in the movie   mera i thought the actors did a fairly good job but i just couldnt connect with their characters and that just took me out of the movie secondly the non stop barrage of action sequences which would have felt awesome if i had time to pause and take a break after each sequences it almost felt like the director was putting on one action scene after another to make up for and mera by the time the movie reached its climax i was completely exhausted and i couldnt focus much on the the battle with the ocean master thirdly they could have done a better job with the ocean master the actor who plays him is such an amazing actor and i thought they kind of wasted his potential imo is not a terrible or a bad movie but just that i didnt find the central characters appealing and that just made the movie mediocre for me,fantasy
this movie had it all superman antman daenerys lines for 25 years old kids star wars cities dolf langen dying his hair with his daughters dry wetter taft the evil brother thats a 45 years old crybaby daeneriy clone looking better than khals new green cleavage wonder woman extremely bad music funny lines that made me cringe black panther batman iron man any man jujitsu godjira karateh ariel everythingthe only movies worse than this are those of sergiu nicolaescu starring sergiu nicolaescuif you didnt see this movie yet wait for a few years maybe you get lucky and die before you have to,fantasy
rubbish bored couldnt wait for the end very disappointedno chemistry on screen one of the poor super hero movies to come out,fantasy
its a good story with good visual effects but theres few screenplay mistakesit wasnt explained why the atlantis acquired skills to breathe underwatereven though kings fiance the girl helped and was falling in love other man very quicklywith all his strong capacity had troubles with a fight against a single manin general a regular movie at all,fantasy
it was not i trust imdb for the most part this one was a big fat fail it was terrible in so many different ways,fantasy
besides wonder woman i have not been too impressed with dc movies recently but growing up and loving those superheroes i always give those films a go there were things that worked and didnt work for sadly more things didnt work the cgi and fight scenes were often over the top the biggest issue for me was buying into this universe if you look at guardians of the galaxy we easily bought into into that crazy space journey with funny looking creatures in that respect is more believable but sadly it comes across as far fetched and youre not really immersed or taken on a journeyone positive is the somewhat decent plot on one side there is a human rivalry and the other is an oceanic empire wanting to strike back at humans jason momoa does what he can with the script but its not enough to carry the film it tries to pull off too much of the unbelievable and passable this is not a terrible film but its not memorable lets just say if viewers saw it showing on tv years from now they would probably keep flicking channels compared to tuning in for a few minutes its passable and not the win that dc so desperately needs to respond to the huge success and formula used by marvel6510,fantasy
a very nice dc comics movie although the movie is mostly cgi jason momoa is pretty good but amber heard mera is awful she simply cant act and her hair omg whatdisappointed,fantasy
ihave read so many mixed reviews online from movie goers its terrible its a great movie its a black panther copy blah blah blah i will see and when i do i will come back post my comments and reviews because right now my favorite marvel movie is wonder woman justice league batman vs superman  avengersinfinity and last but not least black panther,fantasy
disclosure i have been on the record for many years that im not a big fan of the superhero genre people have explained to me dc and marvel blah blah but its just not my thing i usually just catch a superhero movie on tv when im in the mood which isnt ofteni like marine wildlife so a movie about underthesea critters has an appeal the mood struck so seeing in the theatre seemed worthy of my timei found the movie to be of very average acting minus the antagonist stepbrother i found the computer graphics to be the best part of the filmmomoa was fine but they made his role a bit hokey with the way he stared at the camera and also some of his lines a few times he blurted out a curse word in his oneliner i thought to myself heres a movie made for kids why are we trying so hard here to fit in the s word or something similar it just didnt fit the movie vibe and was unnecessaryi also felt like the movie producers were trying awful hard for future cashgrabbing how many characters can you introduce that look completely different so we can put a bunch of these toys out on shelves haha i sound like a hater but just being honestit was an okay flick a decent time,fantasy
the visuals are enough to pull you in but the story is pretty basic we gotta get the thing to beat the bad guy yayyy that didnt really bother me as much as the lack of chemistry between mera and arthur as well as that plucky cutesy music thatd play sometimes never mind the acting of the teenage which honestly made me laugh during that scene despite the fact its supposed to be serious other than that if youre looking for something decent to watch maybe go for this if you choose to skip dont worry you really arent missing much,fantasy
710 for the cgi and jason momoas performancethe rest of the movie wasnt really outstanding but the visuals were amazing better than any other superhero movie that ive seenjason momoas performacs was heartwarming and honest a very good choice for this characterthe rest of what constitutes this movies doesnt require much further analysis its exactly what you would expect from a movie like this pretty banal and unsuprising,fantasy
the whole story is extremely predictable and boring the fighting scenes are terrible except for the opening scene seems like they spent most of the choreography practicing on that one scene then quickly filmed the rest of the fight scenes nicole kidman was a complete disaster shes lost all sense of acting cant even walk right damn ive seen a lot of people on here putting the blame on amber heard but i actually enjoyed her character and acting momoa and her jived well together then theres the cgi i get it its an underwater movie you have to have cgi but please just wait were not there yet with the technology it looks so bad and unrealistic get some inspiration for marvels cinematics for inspiration,fantasy
firstly i would like to say that my mouth came out of the cinemas with a cramp as i was watching this movie earlier today i was smirking smiling laughing my way through i probably bothered some other people in the cinema but it was just that amazing the action was stunning and perfectly done the imagination of the movie was unique it didnt just reflect some of the problems we have like pollution and chemical dumping in the sea but also gave us another daydreaming topic just imagine what is in the bottom of the sea what would the politics of the sea might be what would happen if there is such miracle under the ocean the creativity deserves a  omgoodness let me watch this 10 million times this needs a sequal well at least from me i have watched thousands of movies okay that was exaggerated but this movie i watched it and it is now offically my top 1 my mind is exploding with this imagination and i strongly suggest you go watch it its aquamazing,fantasy
 brings more to the table and adds more the franchise of the dceu then any other dc movie one main reason is how much the movie was able to keep the look and the story origin to the comics second reason is how dominant looks in the film they made the man that talks to fish a total badass after watching this movie u can argue that is more stronger the thanos and superman combined and my last main point is how they were able to bring something so bright and vibrant into the dark dceu zack snyder directed james wong deserves some kind of award for this master piece he deserves to be directing the entire franchise,fantasy
 is a 2 and a half hour movie of cgi action scenes and political nonsensei am struggling to review this because i forgot 90 of the movie right after i saw it there are no interesting charters a meaningless story and boring action,fantasy
i thought after wonder woman which was fantastic these dc films had turned a corner but no for any good points it has is legit a bad film i spent most of it hoping it would be over soon its all endless overlong cgi and boring protracted dialogue literally everything a character says is either dull tedious flat exposition or some cheesy cheesy joke the script is terrible and the plot is meaningless and the whole thing looks like its straight out of 1994 the costumes deserve a particular mention because they look exactly like a 1990s tv scifi show some of the costumes notably nicole kidmans got a laugh in the cinema i was in and i dont think that was intentional the only saving grace for me is jason momoa he seems likeable and made the best of some genuinely bad lines he looks the part too and i suppose it is marginally better than justice league though not by muchpersonally if id known what its like i wouldnt have gone to see it i seriously considered leaving the cinema halfway which ive never done out of boredom theres plenty of other stuff at the cinema right now so save your time for those better films instead,fantasy
 is special effects extra vaganza but seriously lacks in plot character development and some serious directorial decisionsso in just about the first scene we learn that arthur or as he is known as is pretty much invincible he takes a grenade in the chest and doesnt get a scratch so physically you cant get to him for a movie that is just about 150 minutes of fighting that is kind of a problem yes i know the hero will win in all movies but it is easier to get engaged into a movie if there actually is a theoretical chance the hero might get hurt kind of a basic rule with heroes they should have a a weakness something that his enemies might exploit supermans kryptonite is a fine example seems to have no weakness sure atlantean technology can cut his skin but even when he is stabbed or shot with plasma strong enough to make stone explode he isnt much worse for wear not to stop fighting anyway or deliver some onelinernot even when acquires the superweapon atlans trident guarded by the ancient powerful monster karathen are there any suspense there actually is no fight at all so the movie seriously lacks suspense whats worse is arthur himself doesnt seem to think there is any either he mostly cracks som weak jokes and seem to take very little seriously so why should we another side effect of all the weak jokes and fighting is that arthur and mera never really develops any chemistryand why aside from setting up a sequel was black mantha in the movie at all it didnt need more fights and that was about all you got out of that character you might have used it to explore and develop arthurs relationship with his father  a possible weakness and when the movie is full of action and running over 150 minutes you might want to consider sutting a subplot outvisually the movie is stunning the settings in atlantis is wondrous and i really liked the use of electronic music and the neon lights got some flashbacks of tron there however it is not enough to carry a movie still the action is good so it is not like inte isnt an entertaining movie but it doesnt really live up to the competition,fantasy
if youre looking for a movie that checks all the boxes this isnt it it has a weak script predictable plot and the acting is rough at points but its still fun and i enjoyed the film i think it got better as it went but the ending did leave a lot to be desired,fantasy
there are plenty of reviews for this unique movie so i will be quick fist of all i am both a marvel and a dc fan and i support their movies as they deserve without exceptions in my opinion is an awesome movie and the best of dceuadvantages amazing cgi good directing cinematic epic fightduels and largescale battle good actors performance and preety actress based on greek mythology representing a fantastical world right underneath usdisadvantages some bad dialogues perhaps a bit more explanations more character development more realistic in some scenesi hope there is an epic sequel which keeps all of the advantages and turns the disadvantages into more advantages and i am sure that dc will do so be sure to watch this amazing movie in the cinemas to sum up it is a worth watching movie with epic cinematography every frame feels like a painting worth sitting in must see movie however be as always cautious do not have very high expectations in order not to ruin a goodmovie,fantasy
the screenplay is an absolute train wreck i dont know how the big wigs in charge of the dc universe continually higher such crappy writers and directors the dialogue was painful the story arc was numb the plot was predictable characters wereyawn it had such potential to be good but instead was a 400 million messthe acting is really poor jason mamoa struggles to show any emotion there is no crescendo for him hes just static through the whole thing amber heard is a poor mans mashup of ariel and scarlett johansons black widow willem dafoe is generally a decent actor but his character is written so poorlydont get me started on manta honestly decent job acting but why on earth is his character in the movie oh and funniest part of the movie is when teenage arthur says does she not love me in the highest pitch voice its just painfully bad like worse than anakin skywalker in the phantom menace actually 10x worseits not worth your money or time i went because it got solid reviews especially for a dc movie and my hopes were high after wonder woman but this was just hot garbage,fantasy
story doesnt take precedence in this world any longer gone are the days of dark epics and complex antiheroes that fall over their own motives the dceu has realised its better off trying not to emulate christopher nolans batman trilogy and strikes a much finer balance because of it as far as origin stories go if you can call it one after jason momoas equally strong performance in justice league its much larger than the usual efforts that aim more precisely to establish rather than finish anything instead has loftier ambitions and though the pace can border on unrelenting at times its forgivable given how big this world is and how thoroughly the filmmakers immersed themselves in it theres enjoyment to be found in simply being along for the ride even if most of it was clearly computer generated knows that we arent going to take everything it gives us with the utmost seriousness and its refreshing that the film doesnt try to play its sillier moments with a straight face its definitely a fine instalment into the evergrowing panoply of superhero movies and absolutely worth watching on a friday evening with handful after handful of popcorn,fantasy
aqua man a is a film filled with lots of cgi which in ways can make it good but in ways can bring it down a little and even though it is an extremely long film i feel like there could split the film up into so that they give more time for characters and setting because i just felt like it was a bit rushed and there was little packed in even though it was two 2 12 hours roughly so in my opinion it is okay film which will probably do well for people as its a marvel or dc or et cetera type of film where it fits down the storyline i i think there should be another aqua man which helps us understand a little bit more and involve more of the characters from justice league yes so that is what i think of aqua man,fantasy
i really enjoyed this one and i kind of wish id have waited to watch it the first time at home in 4k am i the only one that feels that theater isnt as good quality anymore anyway i dont know much about so that is maybe what furthered my enjoyment this movie was funny at times awesome action and looked amazing the underwater stuff was so pretty might be a good one for imax but nearest one for me is about 45 minutes to an 1 hour away i am a bit confused as to where the movie falls in the dcu timeline there are 1 or 2 lines that maybe should have just been thrown out and would have solved that issue this one feels like it should happen before justice league but because of those lines it has to be after the confusing part is that if this is post justice league why does it feel like he has never been to atlantis before black manta was pretty cool and stay tuned for the post credits scene at the end he didnt have much in this movie and thats ok because there is already a lot going on it feels like they are building him up for future things too other than the confusing timeline stuff some of the underwater creatures brought gears of war images to the mind you will know what im talking about when you see it please let this be a sign to the powers that be to discontinue the use of zack snyder james wan did such a great job with a much lesser known character just imagine what he or someone other than snyder could do with batman all in all there is still hope for the dcu so now lets hope for the best with shazam,fantasy
im not sure if it was because i was tired or not but i thought the movie was kinda boring but i will say that the world building is great and atlantis is beautiful but everything else is kinda a mess the cgi was over the top and looked extremely unrealistic in some scenes the lighthouse scenes in particular the pacing was bad and went really fast that for me didnt allow me to keep up with the story although the movie had one of the coolest action scenes i have ever seen would recommend you go see it though to make a decision for youself and the movie is better that some other stuff dc have put out not as good a wonder woman though,fantasy
what a klishe script especially jason mamoa and all the actors and actrists was but the script was like thors there are 2 brothers and one of them is stepbrother klishe,fantasy
funny and quiet amazing special effects could be better but definitely a good time looking at the big screen ,fantasy
all around great movie really added dimension to the character graphics are awesome,fantasy
arthur has become disenchanted with the idea of atlantis and prefers life with his father on land but hes still the hero we know as his confusion leads him through the most entertaining adventure the dc universe has shared with us recently parents should know that there are a lot of jump scares and plenty of violent scary scenes in the movie its directed by someone who typically directs horror movies but it is a lot lighter than batman vs superman there are lots of fun comedic moments but this is not for a younger audience check out our review and discussion questions at down the hobbit hole blog dot com,fantasy
the film kicks off with an extended introduction showing inception before the title page appearsthe characters seemed wellcast and the acting held uphowever the script was fairly predictable and the story arc very familiar in a way an underwater avatar with the mould already castplothole how did they dig their way out of that holeoverall an entertaining watch,fantasy
finally dc made a cool movie enjoyed awesome visual treat,fantasy
 always seemed like a character that wouldnt translate well to the big screen a bit over a decade ago hbos entourage did a seasonlong storyline about the ridiculousness of the concept of an movie even before that the character had routinely been a punchline to many even comic fans thats why it was pretty surprising that jason momoas portrayal of arthur curry in 2017s justice league was one of the highpoints of the film for those who enjoyed momoas performance in justice league his solo movie is more of the same if not betterdirector james wans greatest decision with is in the fact the tone is kept relatively light and fun wan is smart enough to realize that a dark brooding just would never work wan doesnt overload his film with too many jokes but keeps the dialogue snappy and occasionally tongueincheek complementing the tone is great use of color to match the beautiful ocean cinematography a lot of comic book adaptations have a very similar look to them but is infinitely more colorful and distinct in its color palette the only real problem with the look of the film is that a lot of the cgi resembles a video game this is the most common problem with blockbusters today as even pretty good cgi is still obvious cgi which tends to take me out of the movie a bitdespite the overuse of cgi for the costumes none of the actors come off as ridiculous jason momoa gives a charismatic fun performance amber heards performance has received some criticism but i found nothing wrong with it dolph lungdren makes the most of his small role though its weird to see lungdren in a role where he doesnt punch anything patrick wilson comes the closest to almost crossing the line between silly and foolish though thats due more to the dialogue hes given more than anything else wilson still makes for an effective villain the scenes with him and momoa going against each other are amongst the more interesting although the final confrontation is slightly disappointingits unclear at this time whether an sequel is in the works as warner bros seems unsure about what to do with their dc series right now despite minor problems is the most entertaining dc film released this decade what could have been a disaster is an absolute blast from start to finish and james wans strongest film yet recommended to even those who dont particularly love the titular character 7510,fantasy
this is a clean movie i found it to be worth watching and even worth buying on bluray when available i noticed a few glitches but thats okay and that says a lot for me about a movie if i would buy it and watch it again great going guys we could use some more movies like this that do not have foul language or sex scenes in it,fantasy
i m also dc fan but not deserve 1010 reallyokey effects are good and not feel me cgi this is a good thing but movie is little boring and make me feel leave the cinema hall but i stay it and i chance my mind its deserve 710by the way christopher nolan please come and save us,fantasy
although im a marvel fan but this was good the undersea visuals and effects using water was amazing and fun to watch this and batman might only be my fav dc movies so far,fantasy
the good film score is very different and memorable unlike the formulaic marvel scores jason mamoa is the best part of he does a fantastic job of balancing the action drama and comedy in the film the cgi is beautiful james wans vision for this new cinematic world was ambitious and boldthe bad the dialogue is just horrible in several spots jason mamoa had the better part of the dialogue but amber hurd kidman and black mantas suffered the most casting aside from mamoa was weird i felt like they sought out actors to be unique rather than fit the chemistry for mamoadespite my weak rating on this movie overall i am looking forward to the 4k release because it was a beautiful movie,fantasy
the film is completely predictable but as a dc movie it is pretty good,fantasy
even though i always critic dc and favor marvel more i still watch all of them haha so for this one i guess its the best dc movie ever its straightforward easy plot and total full of action unlike martha this one is really good love all the sea creature,fantasy
i liked aquamam it was bigcolorful fun and overall an enjoyable dc superhero movie however it did have some significant flawsi can say that aquamam was dcs most ambitious movie to date and they nailed mostthe first act of the movie is pretty solid you get some backstory on author curry some nice foundation for the plot and interesting interactions between aquamam and the villain black manta earlier on which the movie does a good job of making you understand his motivations for hating aquamam and wanting to kill him and makes aquamam reconsider some of his actions regarding black manta which was some nice writingthe second act of the movie was surprisingly the weakest just when the story was about to kick into gear the movie gets goofy i mean characters like mera and become cartoony and silly as the movies attempts to make you laugh becomes forced and awkward i mean there is literally toilet humor in this movieit looked like two different people were directing the movie compared to the first half of the movie even characters like black manta became campy with him saying some weird dialogue i wouldnt say the second act is terrible but compared to the first act of the movie its just not as goodluckily the movie comes into focus in the last third of the movie with some very good action compelling story and surprisingly great cgi throughout the movie and some of the best ive seen in a long whilethe best characters in the movie were undoubtedly and mera jason mamoa and amber heard had nice chemistry with each other even in the goofy scenes journey to becoming king was well done as the movie made you understand why he reluctant to be king and how character grew throughout the movie especially with the help of mera who also has a good mini arc in the movie and she had some badass scenes in the movie and again her best moments was with as they went well togetherthe villain ocean master played by patrick wilson was bland i mean they could have done much more with him but as the movie went on he became just another generic bad guy earlier in the movie he had some decent reasons for wanting to have war with the surface and had some good interactions between him and since their brothers but you never got to see more of that patrick wilsons performance wasnt even bad it was actually decent but the story involving him didnt have anything significant to do besides being evil because he is a bad guylike i said earlier the visuals were incredible and very colorful especially with the scenes under water and the sea creatures i never knew james wan was capable of directing a movie with such incredible visuals and great cgi so one thing you could say about is that it was truly a spectacle at times atlantis and other sea kingdoms looked pretty good and contributed to the story well however sometimes these under water kingdoms like atlantis felt empty at times i mean it looked interesting but you never got to see more of it besides action scenes and water battles which was kind of disappointingthe action was also very good again the visuals helped make the action good at times especially the final battle it wasnt the best thing ever but it was very nicethe story is pretty solid and journey is interesting as he deals with responsibilities he doesnt want to have but he grows over time into a hero and despite being campy at times the movie has some pretty funny scenes so thats another plusso i enjoyed its dc best movie since wonder woman not as great but still a pretty good movie with a solid story great cgi and visuals and characters despite a bland villain and silly second act hope this continues for dc movies,fantasy
i think wans portrays the character and stays loyal to the story as well as it can its impressive how they were able to bring all those fantastical battle scenes and underground scenes to the big screen with modern technology a true dream come true for comic book fans the story is a great standalone movie but doesnt feel like it serves any greater purpose like those marvel films i guess for both better and for worse also unlike marvel movies or previous dc films i think the movie finds a good balance between being darkdeep and comical the buildup is a little long but the content within doesnt feel like filler and makes the world of atlantis more interesting its impressive how so many integral elements of the film was integrated the biggest problem with the film are the dialogues they are painfully simplistic and uninspiring to the point where it feels awkward someone needs to tell the writers that writing movie lines are not the same as writing comic dialogues,fantasy
 is a visual masterpiece and a great movie in general the acting is solid and all try their best and clearly are having fun the humor is real hit or miss but isnt as much of an issue to kill the movie jason mamoa as is great so are the rest of the cast i left this movie satisfied of how it ended,fantasy
while watching the movie i was so involved into it and it took me into some transe is fully loaded action 3d film with all the exciting stories and action sequencesfinally it give you a good experience of 3d movie with action,fantasy
something i would rewatch i was just hoping to see more of the young,fantasy
i didnt like the first trailer so i wasnt expecting much but it was actually a pretty good movie its not anything astounding thatll leave you amazed but itll keep you occupied and interested the visuals are amazing for the most part but when they try to combine cgi with reallife scenes the difference can be pretty jarring the acting is great though i dont think the movie spends much time actually looking at or developing its charactersit focuses on the story and kind of throws simple character archetypes into it but the story itself is great enough to cover that the soundtrack is often amazing but theres this one tune that they kept playing whenever something significant happened and i started getting sick of it there was a total of 4 times that characters were chilling when they were suddenly surprised by a fiery explosion all in all it wont be the greatest movie youve ever seen but id definitely recommend it if you have time,fantasy
 may well be the least original film you have ever seen literally everything that happens and is of any significance to the plot can be seen from a mile away but it doesnt really matter dc has had enough failures in recent years to excuse their lack of risk at least when this avalanche of cliches works to make an enjoyable film and i thought its nice that in such a formulaic story they found a place for dolph lundgren because how best to wrap up a clichefest than with a washed up action star moreover if the film was a bit older jason momoa would have gotten a haircut during the first 5 minutes which would be disastrousi havent really said anything about the film itself  disappointed heroheir to throne gets called to save homeland has to face evil brother needs magic swotrident has help of wise old guy and pretty girl i feel like willem dafoe should be rejecting this kind of roles not that i can blame himi wish superhero films werent so hellbent on advanced civilisations  aliens having so much blind faith in hereditary absolute monarchy but as we established this is not the place for such moontalk what you might complain about in terms of messages is that the whole humans  landpeople are destroying the oceans thing isnt given the gravity it deserves,fantasy
with jason momoa as himself and amber heard casted as the beautiful mera you already know its going to be a good looking movie knowing that james wan is more of a horror producer than an action movie director he did a good job tackling this installment bringing in patrick wilson as kind orm was a good tribute to having him be familiar within wans work in general the movie was great action packed adventure i thoroughly enjoyed seeing the idea of atlantis and how the characters looked underwater as well as their relationships with the different characters to see how they played within the story line however the cgi has been getting slightly more noticeable within the last couple movies that i have seen some of the stunts preformed in this movie that should have either injured the character or end up in a fatality to return a few scene later didnt feel authentic if you have seen avatar directed by james cameron there is no doubt to where wan got his inspiration from atlantis has the same feel as if you were in the land of pandora but just underwater all in all a great addition to the dc universe and cant wait to see what comes next,fantasy
i generally dont like dceu because it doesnt know what it wants to be but this movie is different because to me it belongs to the mcu it has everything id want in a superhero movie background story comedy romance action and most importantly quirkiness im not saying it is perfect because it obviously isnt the jokes felt somehow forced and very lame sometimes and the romance was a bit stiff and very predictable but i still enjoyed my time it felt more like an animation film than a live action movie honestly which is great,fantasy
the first 2 and a half hours got me gasping such a magnificent pictures nice soundtracks and sounds light story and perfect dose of humours totally worth to be watch more than 10 times,fantasy
for a decent while now the dceu has been subject to controversy with the only movie being loved by both fans and critics to be wonder woman beyond that each film has had some sort of issue in the filming process before its initial release rather that be suicide squad with all of the joker scenes being cut or justice league with its infamous superman mustache issue all of these factors and more led to these films getting poor reception from critics and a few fans so going into there were many who were very skepticalhowever with james wan at the helm i had little worry the man was known for making films that were commercially viable the conjuring 2 film made 320 million dollars on a 40 million dollar budget saw made 103 million on a meager 12 million dollar budget and furious 7 made over a billion dollars on its big budget 200 million dollar production cost so there was little doubt that the film would do well as far as quality wan usually churns out quality work his saw series is beloved by many fans his conjuring work had been exceptional and insidious while not as beloved as saw is also its own franchise so i was pretty optimistic on him taking on the visual spectacle that was man who can talk to fish the moviein regards to visual effects the movie isnt all that spectacular there were areas that i found to be very clunky mera from a purely special effects standpoint never looked real there were a lot of water effects that looked fake the designs of the home where lived were nice looking but still needed a bit more rendering to be done the fight scenes i will admit are pretty bad ass every fight seemed to find a way to surprise me the ones underwater seemed to impress me the most with their visual flaresjason momoa also bolstered a lot of confidence and charisma in the role his flirtatious attitude with mera and his audacious approach to to his brother always put a smile on my face he was defiantly perfectly cast in the role of a superheroadditionally the film tends to be very funny it always knew how to make you feel good when you watched there was a lot of great chemistry between and other character that allowed for some really enjoyable sequence that made me grin from ear to ear it was just a good upbeat and fun experience at the moviesbut my favorite aspect of the film was black manta he was a marvelous villain from start to finish he always kept me interested in the pain he was feeling at the loss of his father and how chose not to save him this anger fuels the antagonist and pushes him to vengeance this desire makes the audience feel sympathetic to his plight and his desire for revengeking orm wasnt nearly as compelling but i did like his character he was more your standard bad guy who wanted to become king for his own selfish reasons and hated the people on the surface there is a part of me that wishes this was two movies instead of just one perhaps then king orm would be a little bit more three dimensional than he turned out to bei really loved and meras relationship it was really sweet and funny jason played it more in the tone of him seeing her as a sexy catch and she was the sassy redhead who wanted him just as badly and when looking at it through those eyes then they really work well for each otheroverall though there isnt really anything surprising here it pretty standard superhero stuff there a big awesome fight at the end of the movie that was cool to see mera and have a overly dramatic kiss and the movie ends with giving a hopeful monologue to the future so it was good,fantasy
after a long time  seriously long after wonder woman   dc gave a movie which was thrilling and entertaining beautifully builds up the past events about the hero born from love between mankind and waterkind jason mamoa at his best as always and i enjoyed his character the most,fantasy
besides the fall flat jokes and the acting of young at ine point movie was enjoyable,fantasy
i think dc ruined their chance to even come close to reentering their rivalry with marvel wonder woman was the starting point and was meant to put them back in the game alas they messed it up with a bad storyline some random oceanmaster brother and a wasted black manta there are some good parts in this movie though jason momoa as is a great pick and he does a great job as the funny beer drinker that enjoys a swim from time to time the visuals in this movie are breathtaking and some of the best ive seen in quite some time this movie wouldve been much lower in rating if it werent for momoa and the gorgeous visuals,fantasy
thankfully finally dc comes through in a big big way what a beautiful well written movie the best part zak snyder is nowhere near this project the soundtrack cinematography and cast worked so well together i believe it also helped that this origin story hasnt been told that often i was beyond impressed i think i only caught one mention of the monstrosity that was justice league and once this movie was tied to that universe they made the right decision and steered clear seeing this movie done so well it made me wonder what could have been for the dceu had they been smart about things and you know actually built their universe from the ground up with movies like this either way it looks like things are finally looking up if they can continue to make movies like this give it a try 810rob,fantasy
disclaimer i am an mcu fan through and throughi feel like dc got their groove with this film coupled with wonder woman i feel like i wont have mixed emotions on any more of their films if they can keep the juju goingthe colors the visuals the imagination even the story plot wasnt complicated even if there were deviations from what might be canon and there was just enough of everything to make me love this film jason mamoa seemed to enjoy his role nothing like an actor who is having funthey should not have rushed justice league i feel like a movie like this for each hero would have helped audiences connect more with what otherwise seemed like a last minute buildateam movie,fantasy
visuals are stunningly beautifulstory is mildy strongscript is weakwatch this if you want an action packed thrilling experience but dont expect much from the actors because of the as said weak script,fantasy
out of expectation from a dc movie better than wonder woman in my opinionmany badass scenes jason momoa is so amazing he took this movie to a brand new level must watch,fantasy
 review by hezy jamesdirector james wanrelease date 12211018my own personal score 9510rating pg13runtime 2hrs 23 minscast jason momoa amber heard willem dafoe nicole kidman patrick wilsonwarning  major spoiler alertokay so i have seen it twice now with 2 different groups i have to say that i am very impressed been a while since i seen a good movie that combines everything action family drama comedy romance and mystery the storyplot is good even though there are some moments that are questionable but i will get into that later i absolutely loved it and would recommend you go see it yourself the trailers do not give it enough credit in honesty the trailers sucked but the movie was 100 times better than the trailer i was not sure what to expect the first time because i did not see the trailers at all before my friends took me to the movie theater it was not until the first fight scene where the guards came to take atlanna that i was thinking oh okay its going to be one in those movies okay let me get comfortable then it was so good that the first time i saw it i had to pee like 1 hour and 15 mins into the movie and i did not want to miss a scene so i held it im guessing everyone else did the same cause as soon as the post credits scene finished we all ran out to the bathroom the second time i filled my bookbag with candy and junk food do not judgewe all have done it when the movie finishes i completely forgot all the stuff in my bookbag i got so hooked into the movie i forgot i had snacks and candy well lets dive right into itplotstoryi personally think the plot was well written overall minus a few moments which i will address in the feedback section lower down the plot is about arthur who is going on a journey of selfdiscovery the whole movie he keeps saying he is not worthy to be king but he finally accepts it with the help of some friends i feel the plot had just enough of everything love between tom and atlanna and between mera and arthur the love between tom and atlanna we felt his pain all right imagine walking to the end of a dock every morning for 20 years just hoping the love of your life would be there comedy they threw in a few jokes with arthur that made him not look like the im all about seriousness 247 type and i loved that also made the whole movie theater laugh too family drama we can feel the tension coming from arthurs little brother orm in orms opinion arthur is the reason their mother was killed mystery they added little mystery with atlanna and what really happened to her all they kept saying is she was sacrificed to the trench which arthur comes to learn is their form of a execution we dont get to see what the trench is until the very end of the movie and woah not a nice way to be sacrificed for surecharacterscastthe cast did an amazing job i feel as if they all fitted their characters perfectly in my opinion i did not see any flaws or anything i did not like the acting was good and made the characters come to life even morecinematographythe shots and camera angles were amazing specially during the fight scenes movement with the actors was good i loved how it would switch scenes quickly like when vulko threw the trident at arthur and then its a flashback of young arthur catching a trident the colors used to show atlantis was stunning the scene where arthur arrives in atlantis for the first time it was just so colorful and beautiful the dessert scene even though i loved it made me feel as if i was playing uncharted again i mean i loved the game so i did not mind that scene special effects were awesome with all the underwater scenes and the creatures overall the scenes were shot beautifully and the environment looked amazingfeedbackokay so i have been seeing a lot of the comments for the movie and about those questionable scenes lets get into it first the scene where black manta is upgrading the weapons and armor he got from orm okay im seeing a lot of comments that is asking how he knows how to re work the well what is considered alien tech to him he could have messed with the wrong thing and blow himself up second atlanna and how she survived on that island alone for so long what did she eat where did she get the awesome end game high level armor she was wearing where did she keep her bottles of loreal on the island to keep her hair looking just like when she left in the beginning we have to remember that they had a time limit to work with and when movies are being editing in the final moments a lot of scenes get deleted to meet the time goal is already very long at 2hrs and 23mins they could not really add in any extra scenes that was not really needed yes we could of use a scene where a younger black manta was trying to sneak into atlantis to steal weapon manuals or blueprints or instead kidnapping one of their weaponarmor builders and him torturing them to teach him how to or a scene where atlanna was on the island trying to start a fire and cutting up some dinosaur meat yes dinosaur meat in the scene where they show the island you can see dinosaurs running around so yea these scenes that we feel are missing we will just have to use our imagination to fill in the blanks and understand that the movie is already as long as it isfavorite quotesmera what did he just sayarthur something something tridentmera we need water youre the closest sourcearthur show off i couldve just peed on itorm my brother has come from the surface to challenge me for the thronearthur i call it an asswhoopingso overall i would give this movie a 9510 as my own personal rating and would recommend you go watch it and see for yourself it is a wonderful movie that displays a strong plot with an amazing group of actors set in a unforgettable environment mixed in with love comedy and drama oh and stay for the post credits scene it shows that black manta might be the big bad guy in part 2 and trust me the end credits song is just beautiful that i actually think people stayed more just because of the song than the post credits scene the song is skylar grey  everything i need for those who are wondering there is a original and a film version just remember to use the bathroom right before you go into the movie theater and dont forget that you have any snacks or junk food,fantasy
wellllll this is one of the most unexpected glory for dc they started to understand what real movies should be like  is a great hit afterallperfectly selected cast interesting scenes and huge i mean huuuuuuuuuge effects used and battles made well done dcwe hope they keep up the standards,fantasy
as a box office success this entry for dc has almost made as much as justice league in a weekaimed at a much younger demographic then the dark batman v superman films this movie is light comedic and sometimes quite corny what a dc movie should be was my favourite character in dc and hes done justice in this versionhowever it works and it is entertaining a stellar cast including nicole kidman willem dafoe patrick wilson do a great job with the source material jason momoa is solid as the title character but far different to the i remember as a kid back in the 80s amber heard plays a pivotal role as the princess and holds the movie together looks a lot like scarlett johanssondirected by james wan who specialises in horror films the styling of this films was my major concern based on it being mostly underwater but its done well and after a while you get used to the visual aspects of the movie whilst watching i felt aspects of movies like tron guardians of the galaxy and flash gordonas usual with superhero films the running time at 140 minutes is probably 25 minutes too long6910couldnt quite give it 7 but good option at the cinema with the family  probably not small children theres quite a body count in a cartoon kind of way,fantasy
its just a really good fun audio and visual spectacular up there with wonderwoman for dc movies keep it up guys this is what we want ,fantasy
it wasnt horrible but it wasnt great either i like superhero genre in general and it makes me sad how dc keep on disappointing and failing to justify my expectations which were huge considering how hyped this movie wasdc just keep making the same mistakestypical plotvery easy to predictpoor dialoguesnot sure how many fail movies they need to make to realize their mistakes this movie couldve been a lot better if anything unexpected happened and if they dosed those crazy fx which were decent properlyfor example his father couldve died when that garbage wave hit them that would give him a reason to leave surface looking for culpritthan sneaking in atlantisok but getting attacked suddenly in some hidden place makes zero sense they couldve caught him on his way out or somethingbefore fight with his brother he didnt say a word to his peoplelast fight shouldve been on surface because that was his brothers plan  right instead found him fighting crabsalso that antflea guy was so unnecessary they added him just because of second part fight in sicily could happen without him,fantasy
i am so tired of cgi battles its getting to the point where they put me to sleep it was just too much therehowever for most of the film it felt like an adventure that is an improvement over wonder women which felt too much like it was trying to be the dark knightunfortunately goes into dark knight territory enough to irritate the audience that was my complaint about most dceu films they arent made to fit the character they are all just batman clonesit should have stuck with the adventure feel and been a great filminstead it went in the same direction that ruined wonder women and every other dc film of late it tried to emulate batman,fantasy
an unbelievable journey directed by james wanloved it,fantasy
it is predictable but much better than i thoughtbest dc movie for mevisual effects were really nice,fantasy
this movie was so entertaining i spent every minute with my eyes wide in amazement looking at the cinematography and the visuals the world is so well realized and so detailed and the cartoonish nature of is fully realized and taken full advantage of also its mythicstyle story fully complements its grande scale that it fully embraces admittedly it is a dumb movie but it isnt a turn your brain off movie like the michael bay transformers films it takes full advantage of its dumbness and knows exactly what it is if you want a great entertaining time at the theatre is your movie i loved it,fantasy
 is a great movie but it has better special effects then movie itself,fantasy
if you read the reviews provided by the movie critics then obviously youre going to be pushed away from watching this movie however dont fall for it this movie is not oscar worthy but it is entertaining colorful funny and the story line is well developed it deserves a score more than a 55 by the critics if wonder woman received above a 60 for the meta score this movie deserves more because it was far more entertaining and there was not a snooze at any moment,fantasy
i wasnt sure what to expect i never saw the previews they took the time to make a great movie and it showed not going to ramble on just go see it,fantasy
james wan a directorproducer mostly known for his immensely popular horror films shifts genre gears once again to take on one of dcs most iconic heroes having made his first appearance in last years justice league momoa returns in his first standalone adventure that is both ridiculously corny yet ludicrously enjoyable aka arthur curry half atlanteanhalf human is the rightful heir to the throne of atlantis and is reluctant to leave his human life behind in order to face up to his true destiny with the help of warrior mera heard and atlantis counsellor nuidis vulko dafoe arthur must fight to overthrow his malevolent halfbrother orm marius patrick wilson a frequent collaborator with wan who is preparing to wage a cataclysmic war with the surface worldthe dceu in a nutshell is a complete misfire of a cinematic universe although wonder woman 2017 showed great promise for the franchise even the most hardcore fans cant ignore the disaster that was suicide squad 2016 or the total mess that was batman v superman 2016 with james wan makes the most of a clich ridden script and delivers a surprisingly fun film momoa leads the film with great charisma his performance holds the film together entirely and it is clear hes having an absolute blast in the role patrick wilson was a fitting choice for orm hes menacing when required yet his performance at times is corny beyond belief both heard and dafoe were also excellent casting choices although their characters arent as developed as they could have been it is the action sequences that work best in the film in previous dceu films the action sequences have ranged from excessively dull to criminally forgettable with the exception of the terrific no mans land sequence from wonder woman but wan crafts sequences that are thrilling in execution and epic in scope a fight sequence with side villain black manta who makes an appearance more in the name of fan service rather than plot is particularly awesome and the final conflict may be an overload of cgi but its certainly epic and absurdly entertaining is definitely one of the stronger entries of the dceu its cheesy for sure and the writing is clunky in parts but with momoas excellent screen presence and wan at the helm manages to pull off all its absurdity if the dceu continues in this direction it could finally live up to its full potential and even rival the mcu,fantasy
more than a movie is a visual journey an immersive experience this movie is all about its breathtaking worldbuilding lavish cgi and vfx the very straightforward story and its charming characters serve one purpose make you dive deep into their world and fall in love with it remember avatar well delivers ten times more joy aweinspiring views and badass characters with almost no political agendas this movie is aware of what it is and it doesnt pretend to be anything else because it really doesnt need to which makes it dceus most honest film so far back to cgi and vfx its the most ambitious film since avatar and even gravity as it makes possible what was believed to be impossible and even unthinkable an underwater epic of which we only really had gotten a glimpse with james camerons the abyss that was almost 30 years ago,fantasy
finally dc doesnt make a movie that feels like a funeral as much as i loved wonder woman the dark knight trilogy and man of steel it became crystal clear that dc was more interested in making darker films for adults while alienating the kids that make up most of the target audience for a superhero film there were actually children asleep at justice league whereas my 11year old was on the edge of his seat through its fun upbeat emotional visually stunning and worth the price of not just your ticket but the whole family,fantasy
the movie is one time and it is ok last couple of years has not been good for dc like justice league or wonder woman director james wan has always been in horror films but somehow he managed to direct and he is fantastic director we all know action is superb in jason mamoa and amber heard looked like decent pair in movie patrick wilson is a great dialogue deliver,fantasy
almost perfect but a peculiar set of songs used detract ones enjoyment of the film distraction the viewer from the otherwise great score and fun actionanother issue is an extreme use of expositional diologue which every time with out fail was followed up immediately and explosion near our protagonist just as or before an important part of that beautiful expositional diologue was presented to us forcing unnatural feeling advance in the plothowever aside from some issues a great cast well directed and standard cinematography for this type of film and some okay writing combine to make a decent movie which i did enjoybest part of the film by far willem defoe,fantasy
the stand out element of this movie are the special effects i mean wow the visuals are top notch from the underwater kingdoms to the fight scene in sicily you wont see better cgi this yearthe plot is pretty straightforward acting is good with a tinge of emotion put in to add the depth but all in all this is a great action popcorn movie and one the dceu should be very proud ofgo and watch it,fantasy
 is a good movie lets get that out of the way first the cinematography is fresh and never feels out of place and the movie is visually stunning i also really liked the action scenes while this is all good the dialogue which is good in some places is way too corny at other times the pacing was okay but always just a bit too long or too short another thing i didnt love was king orm he was too over the top villainy and a mcguffin move that is used late in act 3 is only shown very briefly but we never get to know what it is or does and that really bothers me for some reason,fantasy
i was surprised just how entertaining and enjoyable this film was it was awkward at times but there was some great humor and jason momoa played a satisfying role as and was a great fit for the character the story felt large in scale the production design was unique and interesting and the visual effects were stunning the chemistry between arthur and mera was great too with some great moments of humorit was a overall a very well directed and fun boxing day blockbuster and probably dcs best standalone film which brought an interesting origin story and broughtas much justice as they could to a dc character that hardly anyone can actually take seriously at this point the movie itself was silly but it the story was interesting enough with a great cast supporting the characters and was overall a very fun movie with some incredible sequences of action,fantasy
without jason mamoaan easy 6 there was a silliness to the costumes and sequencing that reminded me of power rangers at times but jason adds all the sexiness charm and balls to make cool though if josh holloway had his chance im sure this would have earned an 10 rating best of luck jason,fantasy
i honestly never expected to be this mediocre a friggin 2year old couldve related better and reviewed this movie i dont understand how the producers allowed the screenplay to be carried out like this the acting was below average the plot was way too predictable the characters were underdeveloped and the lines  oh dear god put me out of misery the power rangers had had better lines with their scripts in the 90si cant say that this movie did it justice no pun intended for me just because of very good cgi and sound editing it shouldve been more complete and without a doubt  more mature,fantasy
what more can i say the suit the effects a tad long but again jason momoa,fantasy
 is a fantastic movie for the first time ive watched a 3d movie and i really liked it it was so great watching it and im sure you will not regret seeing it in 3d too jason momoa amber heard and nicole kidman were amazingly good portraying their respective characters great sense of humor as well highly recommend,fantasy
saw it in imax and it was sooooo worth the money while the script had moments when it could have been better as well as the costumes and wigs this is some wonderful fantasy escapism with a strong cast the world they created was amazing the combat scenes were impressive and you believed in the characters i think casting jason momoa as and really connecting with his mixed heritage was a brilliant idea kudos looking forward to the next movie in the series,fantasy
 is unlike anything ive ever seen on the big screen the look and feel of atlantis the costume design creature effects are rivaled only by avatar and the middle earth movies amongst recent tent poles more than just a really good superhero movie is a great scififantasy epic it cant be stressed enough the underwater world of atlantis is so rich and absorbing as to merit the price of the ticket on its own not that the dry land stuff isnt good too it is but its not game changing like the underwater stuff isand dont be worried about the underwater sequences as it pertains to the movement and talking either it was outstanding the action especially the third act stuff was phenomenal among superhero movies released in the last 34 years only infinity wars was betterthe only weaknesses the movie had were the handling of arthur and the movies ambition jason momoa spent most of the movie playing as arthur the dudebro which got a little tiring many of his comedic moments were spoiled in the trailers and others fell flat but once the third act came around and the dudebro stuff gave way to more kingly matters jason really came through all the other actors were note perfect amber heard patrick wilson william dafoe nicole kidman temurea morrison dolph lundgren yahya abdulmateen julie andrews they were all terrificand on the ambition just how much story there was to tell was probably the only real negative the many side plots and changes of scenery and the degree to which they necessitated a change of tone did make the movie feel a tad bit uneven and clunky at times but ultimately every single plot thread was entertaining and interwoven the ending was fantastic and there was really no fat to the movie it was just a really big decadent swashbuckling superhero scififantasy epic with a little shakespearean tragedy comedy and a smidge of horror so much to digest so good,fantasy
im going to keep this short and to the pointi know nothing of the story line and so have no idea if ut follows or not but my wife and i love movies and judge them simply on the movie not the books or stories they come fromthis movie was way better than i expected i expected a decent movie but i expected one that just capitalized on jasons looks no questions thats happening here but then they also capitalize on our heroines amber but in reality they spin a good story and make it very entertainingi actually really enjoyed the cinematography especially in the opening fights scenes it was a spectacular movue in scenes and scopewill definitely watch this movie a bunch of times want to see it in the theaters again too,fantasy
loved this movie   it went quickly for being over 2 hours long because it took time to develop several different characters    the visual beauty is worth admission   but it also entertained   ,fantasy
is a great movie i hope there wil come a second ons of this great film,fantasy
 is awsome movie i enjoy it is best of movie for this year,fantasy
i do not know the dc universe very well but most of his films are mediumsized the best so far was wonder women the story could have been better i think it lacked more care and love for the production everything seems sloppy and hastily done than being an incomplete feature film cgi has the same problems as in previous dceu films in some scenes they are medium in others they are horrible the dialogue was clich and without any creativity sometimes i rolled my eyes imagining what was going on in the writers heads why is it too long some scenes were unnecessary it did not need so much flashback and the romance too forced why two villains in the movie the performance of black manta was really bad i could get him out of the movie i was not going to miss it both villains are generic i love patrick wilson in other roles unfortunately in this movie it was a torturing to see his wasted talent jason mamoa made the give to do with the script the guilt in part is the script poorly written it does not deliver us character development that spoils the movie a lot if had a right storyline good dialogue and character development id totally ignore the horrible cgi and give it a 75 but i must be honest so i give 4  1 because of nicole kidman,fantasy
loved it good action emotion  comedy did everything for me a super hero movie should do so enjoyable ,fantasy
this movie is one of the best dc movies ever i had my doubts but it was different than any other movie and it suprised my and i loved it i know u can guess some of the plot lines but if u love superhero movies youre gonna love this no matter what,fantasy
jason momoa must take his place on his throne as the underwater king  nicole kidman plays his mother queen atlantis and jason momoa rescues her from the outcasts of the deaphs of the water and brings her home to his kingdom and fights his half brother so he can take the place of rightful king of the water,fantasy
this movie was really really long i checked my watch several times hoping it was about finishedvisually the movie is good the plot makes no sense the acting is ok it is just way too longthe costumes are pure cheese it was overall a mediocre experience,fantasy
brilliant film cant wait for a another dc film well done waner brothers and dc comics,fantasy
okay so the plotline is a little weak in spots some combat scenes are too protracted butits beautiful to watch the computergeneration is first class the plot is pretty sensible and the acting is good overall arthur comes across and not only amazing to look at but has a sense of humor and a lot of fun to watch the villains arent so bad they cant be redeemed i guess all in all a movie thats worth the price no idea how a sequel could happen but no doubt it will definitely recommend for anyone over 10 years old,fantasy
did not expect a movie from dc the most colorful and amazing cinematography from dc to date and the main leads wereee wow also would appreciate the fact that the female lead had some good scenes and was fighting alongwith the male actor ,fantasy
this movie really is extraordinary the stunnning underwater scene is a spot on i watched the normal version and decided to watch again in imax 3d which is way better to be honest after all those disappointing dc movies i did not expect this movie can be this good to the extent that i would wanna watch it for the second time the character is well presented and the kingdoms are fascinating with wild imaginary on of the best movies i watched for the year,fantasy
i found stuffs lines or scenes and humor forced to be funny1 mr curry wasnt well directed to show sadness for being left by atlana2 black manta swore his father who wanted to save him3 tough guys asked arthur for wefie at bar4 atlantis ladies costume with high heel5 again the ending scene black mantas lines  help me find him first how about  i have to find him first help methis seemed not 100 james wans,fantasy
as i watched the movie yesterday it was really awesome experience i like the way amber heard done the job of atlantis queen and she looked very hot aint gonna lie jason momoa also looking hella strong and positive about his role he finish it well in the end i was enjoying by watching the movie so for me my opinion it was a good movie after a long time from dc,fantasy
they could have cut 23 of this film and it would have still been good they throw everything including the kitchen sink inits kind of corny but it is executed flawlessly,fantasy
where was this when they left off with the dark knight trilogy puts all those other movies to shame wonder women was good tho but this movie is in the class of marvel as far as the quality of the storyline visual effects this is new and fresh im definitely team,fantasy
totally love it james wan is a genius he give us the best dc movie the actors are great and the story is really good wanna watch it again wan must do the sequel of or jl,fantasy
i admit that i had high expectations before watching the movie because the previews were great but this movie was way better than i could have ever expected this is most definitely jason mamoas best movie and performance i was glued to the screen throughout the whole movie and every passing second was awesome the plot was great and the movie had a perfect flow i loved wonder woman but this movie most definitely exceeded any other dceu movie yet this is what bvs or justice league should have been,fantasy
 is about atlantis needing a king to save them from arthurs brother it is an action packed movie with laughs and scares is a great movie it was fun the watch a good dceu movie that was actually interesting and good the cgi was good i guess the cgi has been good in all of the dc movies that used to be the only goo thing about them the acting was great all the character parts were also good the first scene were the brothers were fighting with there tridents was a little slow i was thinking that that scene could have been a little faster also black manta was barely in the movie at all i wish he could have been in more of the movie he is a spectacular character with great potential this movie was a nerdy movie it could have gone either ways like star wars the last jedi although i though this film was greati would recommend checking out after this i bet the dceu will get better,fantasy
a good sign for a movie is if you increasingly like it as time goes by i liked it a lot after watching it but my appreciation for it has grown since beautiful aesthetics special effects and the character portrayal and growth are very well done it was corny at times and some of the normal landbased scenes sicily looked lesser in quality however the overall quality was a thumbs up and it was a great watch fight scenes were up to par for comic movies and enjoyable to watch i felt the b v s fight scenes were okay especially the last major scene  loved the touches that reminded my of superfriends,fantasy
 is one of the strangest superhero movies ever made and it is also one hell of a crowd pleasing popcorn flick it sucessfully combines action adventure fantasy romance and even horror in spectacular fashiondirector james wan the conjuring furious 7 handles the gargantuan scale with gusto unafraid to embrace the absolute absurdity that comes with a superhero that can talk to fish atlantis is a glistening metropolis of aquatic creatures skyscrapers made of lava and coral and technology that would feel at home in a star wars movie battles sea monsters that look like the offspring of the xenomorph while underwater gladiators ride atop giant seahorses laser equipped sharks or even draconic leviathansthe movie looks huge and the action scenes are outstanding they put most of the recent dc movies to shame with perhaps only being rivaled by the unfairly maligned man of steel instead of having to rescue a city of human civilians has to fend for the lives of his fellow atlanteans plus crab people and even mermaidsif the movie was po faced and self serious it would fall apart and result in a disaster but james wan luckily remembers how much fun and joy can be had in a superhero story the visuals are bright and wondrously imaginative while the tone is pleasantly cheerfuljason momoa is a swaggering roguish hero that smiles at danger and cracks oneliners aplomb instead of frowning in scorn that is patrick wilsons job as the villainous ocean master yes you read correctly and with a name like that he hams it right up momoa has the chops to be a strong likable action lead as princess mera amber heard acquits herself to the action surprisingly well but unfortunately some of her lines are woodenindeed their romance is one of the weaker links of the movie but due to the movies earnest sincerity and the buoyant spirit it remains digestible also there is a key character who is built up as a major villain even remaining true stylistically to the comics but then is promptly dispatched as soon as they appear patrick wilson is appropriately smarmy and haughty as half brother king orm aka ocean master but it feels odd he doesnt have this other antagonist at his side as a henchman in the big climaxit may sound hokey but there is a heart to the proceedings that falls back on the warm family ties between and his parents morrison kidman their family dynamic clearly serving as a metaphor of biracial families and isnt it nice to see a superhero movie where both parents are still alive is yet another step in the right direction for warner brothers dc film franchise its a blast from start to finish with outrageous action and an enormous sense of fun,fantasy
 is one of the best superhero movies ever made and that is no exaggeration just when you think the movie could not get any better it does do yourself a favor and watch it in a theater you wont regret it,fantasy
positivesthe core of the movie is heavily inspired from the works of jeff parker with the hints of geoff johns im a big fan of jeff parkers work so its a big positive in my bookfantastic visuals and many of the scenes looks like real life painting to me especially the diving scene with the trench lots of color pallette as well i was genuinely surprised this movie didnt got an oscar nomination for vfxoctupus on drums being hype man for the fight asian jim og mary poppins as krathen hell yeathose wide angel and tracking shots were stunning this movie in general had some great action sequences with fluid camera shots which were a delight to watchscore was pretty decent actually not soundtrack pretty reminiscent to that of daft punks tron legacycomic accurate costumes take that bryan singeralthough black manta scenes were limited he was a badass and owned every scene he was inthe 3rd act was simply incredible one of best 3rd act in comic book movie probablynegativessimply one of the worst music choices ugh pitbull doing africa by totodceu really need to fix their poor dialogues and writing some of the lines were really cheesy and they tried to cram too many storylines and the plot was predictableif i had a nickle for every time a conversation got interrupted by an explosionorm performance could have been way better without the over the top dialoguesoverall a really solid family friendly flick with some flaws but offers a great visual experience action sequences i would recommend watching this in imax or 4dx,fantasy
a very very watchable movie you wont regret the 10 dollars you might pay for it digital graphics are just awesome i prefer the dark tone like the one in bvs this isnt justice league which was a hybrid of light and dark which turned out to be god awful in the screenings a very decent movie,fantasy
the movie interweaves a fictional story with todays ground reality of how the humans have polluted the seas and lakes around the world the incumbent king of atlantis king orm is ready to wage a war with the surface world along with the help of the other oceanic kingdoms and conquer them but if this happens therell be mass destruction and loss of lives the movie shows how dethrones king orm and stops the destruction from taking place the movie has all the right elements to keep you glued to the screen jason momoa as shines brightly throughout the screenplay the movie is very immersive  makes for a great weekend watch,fantasy
the movie definitely exceeded my expectations for the most part and it was really pleasant to watch however it was a far cry from perfectwhat i liked the most and this is of course my personal opinion is that the incorporated a lot of jokes even though at times it seemed corny it was still funny for me so i enjoyed them the visuals were amazing the color selection  for the most part  was extremely high level the whole concept of filming everything underwater was pure delight to watchnow for the things that could have been improved all the things i am about to say i reviewed them on my way home since i wanted to concentrate on the movie in the cinemablack manta in my opinion the back story was somewhat weak and the dialogue was not strong for the character i think this was mostly an issue on the directors side not the authors further since when do pirates have the ability to dismantle atlantian tech and the reassemble it according to what they need  did the black manta have a degree in roboticsphysics degree or something the second submarine that attacked the meeting between orm and king nereus where did it come from who was behind it not sure i understood that part most likely it was orms doing but never really explained by whom it was piloted or howthe scene jumping from the plane into the desert since when do children of kings and queens can just dive from suppose 500 meters and above and have no damage   of course they have super strength and all but if we were to take actual physics into account here it did seem rather weirdlastly the last fighting scene between the two armies  orms united forces and crab looking people  forgot their name  it was not done in a good manner absolutely the effects were stunning the light show display was amazing but the camera was moving so fast that you could hardly understand what was going on to continue the last fighting scene between an orm how did that ship get up there to the surface it was not shown neither did push it to the surface so who knowsmy biggest surprise was the transition of from this cool confident slightly cocky person to this timid unworthy kind towards the moment of obtaining the trident honestly it felt somewhat strange of course i do know the fact he never wanted to be king but his whole personality of fighting for what is right protecting the people and then suddenly changing to the sour face person who thinks he is unworthy i think the writing of that scene was strangethere were other small plot holes but for the most part it was truly enjoyablethe acting i definitely liked everyone in the movie especially jason momoa and amber heard one could say there was little chemistry between them but in my eyes i saw their sparkle these little hints of something to come it gave me this nice and warm feeling therefore my compliments to the whole crew on delivering this movie to us and on good acting i was going for a 7 but ended up putting an 8 despite the fact i am objective and realistic it is christmas after all,fantasy
the dceu or worlds of dc as they are now calling it have released another standalone movie this time with the character of now dc has been pretty good with their standalone films the only films that i have major problems with are batman v superman suicide squad and justice league justice league wasnt even that bad of a movie it just felt rushed one of the best parts about that movie was the character of a character that everyone thought of as weak and stupid before that movie was released what justice league did however was turn into badass so i was really excited to see how they would expand on his story in his standalone film luckily he is still a badass is not the best film in the dceu but it is definitely not the worst i dont think this is james wans best work either however i still think that is is a very enjoyable movie with a lot of stuff to love its weird to think that this movie belongs to the same universe as batman v superman man of steel and the like its so much brighter so much more colorful it is beautiful to look at all of the cgi makeup effects and costumes look amazing it is the most colorful film in the dceu by far is an awesome character and jason momoa brings a lot of character and comedy to him mera was a very likable partner for to have and she also knew how to kick butt willem defoes character vulko was fine nothing great about him but also nothing bad the villains were actually quite good and you could really reason with almost everything they were doing orm played by patrick wilson bounced off of very well the seriousness of orm and the goofiness of meshed together very well black manta was a fun villain too i liked every scene he was in and his onscreen suit didnt look half bad i just feel that for being most iconic foe he wasnt in the movie enoughnow this movie had some very cringy dialogue that took me out of the movie at times there were also some shots in the film that made it seem like the movie was trying to be too mainstream at one point in the film and mera walk out of the ocean onto a beach in slow motion like something youd see during a swimsuit ad while this is happening a horrible  and i mean horrible  cover of africa by toto being performed by pitbull was playing in the background it was such a ridiculous shot and it took me out of the movie the film also had a lot going on and i feel with a little more cutting it could have been shortened without ruining the plotoverall i think this is a very entertaining movie it adds a lot more color and character to the dceu which is something it much needed its not better than wonder woman but it definitely is better and more well put together than the other films in the dceu im excited to see where they go next with the character if you are skeptical about seeing this movie just give it a try its very entertaining whether you like the dc films or not,fantasy
most satisfying dc film since the nolan franchise awesome action sequences and amazing cinamatgraphy james wan did a fantastic job telling this story of in my opinion an underrated character and jason momoa brought it to life looking forward to seeing what dc has up their sleeve for aqua man as well as other dc characters in future films overall you wont be disappointed with this film its worth it would like to also see james wan direct more dc films and help put dccu back on the map for entertaining super hero films awesome job,fantasy
if you are having any doubts about this stop right now i am a marvel stan but movies like this show me that dc is capable of producing incredible movies wonder woman blew my mind and this did just the same of course there is some cheese patrick wilson i am looking at you but it didnt tarnish anything when the movie ended i wanted moreso thank god for that midcredits scene considering how well this is reviewed i am positive there will be a sequel so to make it simpleif you like attractive leading roles with fantastic personalities nonstop action and i really mean nonstop and beautiful cgi with equally beautiful camerawork this is the movie for you,fantasy
khal drogo played as mixed blood blade with dr dolittles ability in colorful otherwordly avatar world with black panters conflictbest dceu film so farfrom laughing stock character with exception jl animation series transformed into badass character,fantasy
first of all the actors did great jobs as their characters one that shocked me the most was jason momoa i honestly thought i wasnt going to like him as but i did he had some funny lines that made me laugh and he also came across as a guy who honestly didnt want to be king this film has a lot of underwater scenes which means that theyre going to need great visual effects and they did every time you see atlantis it makes you feel like youre there with those characters it kind of reminded me of avatar with how the visuals looked the musical score which was composed by rupert gregsonwilliams helped intensify every scene the music matched each scene perfectly my only complaint about the music was the song ocean to ocean which is a hilariously bad version of africa by toto im just thankful it only played for a few seconds in the movie all of the action in this film is well choreographed and well shot every scene where people are fighting you can clearly see everything thats happening in that scene there was not a lot of camera angle changes and when there were they were to keep somebody in focus and to show what they were doing james wan directs this film and hes mainly known for horror movies and there are elements of that in here but he makes it clear he can direct anything and make it great the main villain orm is a great villain and is well portrayed by patrick wilson but i wish they gave him more of a reason for hating the surface world i wish they did his training scenes before they showed him as an adult this way you would know how he got to be this comfortable with his powers there is an end credit scene that gives a hint to a possible storyline for the possible sequel in the end was a surprisingly good movie hopefully dc continues with stuff like this because then maybe they will be able to challenge marvel,fantasy
solid storyline decent acting and some unique twists,fantasy
lets be clear is a pretty dumb movie but boy if it doesnt put a smile on your face then you probably shouldnt be going to a cgi laden superhero film james wan embraces the lunacy of the subject matter and delivers the dialogue is truly what brings down the movie but jason mamoa doesnt let the poor script stop him from oozing charisma while his chemtestry with costar amber heard doesnt fire on all cylinders it is still fun to watch everytime they share the screen together for all the cgi and there is a ton of it the only time its hard to watch is during the final battle other than that we get some of the best the industry has to offer most of the cast is working below their talents to be sure but they seem to be having fun and deliver convincing performances,fantasy
this is an awesome movie but it is undercut by a terrible score,fantasy
for methis is the best movie since avatari cant wait to see the next part,fantasy
its a amazing movie none stop full of action love  and laugh best dc movie yet  best part of the movie is in the end  watch it in imax,fantasy
this movie has a bit of everything from the little mermaid visual influences of blade runner mixed with fantasy epic plus the adventure of indiana jones all mixed up in a super hero movie package and somehow the directors direction and the charisma of the cast make this movie work its a strange movie but its fun the visual effects do not always work but when they work they are a spectacle it is a pure escapist and metasurrealist film which does not make the mistake of taking itself too seriouslyfor those looking to see a fun movie does not disappoint,fantasy
started off cheesy and i thought it was going to be terrible carried on being cheesy but turned out to be a really good movie,fantasy
the 10s are a bit ridiculous this was not a ten movie this guy is clearly society hasnt kind of figured that out hes not trying to hide or disguise himself hes not working a regular job in an alternate identity lex luthor is not required to figure this out yet manta says several times he needs help finding him clearly mantasa retard yetthere was nothing to imply manta was adapt at reverse engineering advanced technology yet he does it in 2 minutes because he needed to it would have been far better to have an atlantian weapons tech create it for him hes one of those annoying cardboard characters that they leave open his specific skills sets so they can just create an expertise for him whenever needed like how 100s of people in tv and movies are fantastic world class hackers in their spare time in this case manta is tony stark when he needs to beto me if somebody is this smart why are they a pirate why are they covertly working for atlantis how did they meet too many just because things another annoying thingthe bad guys of atlantis clearly know exactly where arthur lives which opens a large kettle of fishat one point a villain will reveal hes known who was loyal to him and who wasnt the entire time which again brings up more questions than answersjason mamoa plays as a surferbiker it helps cement him as about as non royal as king ralph hes a fish out of water one thing that should be amended is hes able to talk to all sorts of marine life not just fishok so theres flaws then theres these 110 reviews also ridiculous the movie is light hearted without mimicking thor ragnarok which got a little too silly the acting is not going to win any awards but i dont see anthony hopkins getting considerations for his marvel work eitherthe visuals are stunning the fight scenes are great the chase scene rivals any bond movie is very strong and invulnerable but hes not superman and this is shown very well that hes a notch below but not too far belowthis was a great effort not as good as wonderwoman but not too far off,fantasy
 is a film cowritten and directed by james wan i remember being the few people who actually liked the trailer and what it was actually going for i was with the film from the beginning after watching it today it felt like an adventure filled rideplot arthur curry the heir to the underwater kingdom of atlantis must step forward to lead his people against his halfbrother orm who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface worldstory and direction i have adored james wan as a director for quite a long time i even liked his film furious 7 maybe i will go on to say the best the series had so with the film i was quite positive that i would fully understand as to what wan wants to achieve and he totally achieves it in this film his vision is huge and he does complete justice to it the film is a big celebration of cgi and style the action scenes are wonderfully choreographed and filmed on wide angles which hugely impressed me the creature designs and production design are impressive also the comedy is just spot on i laughed at even the smallest joke that was cracked the emotional aspect of the film although very small was just great the characterization for most of the characters were spot on they were not perfect which is what i liked the musical score was fabulous the vfx was great and in 3d it just was awesome some things that bogged me down was the runtime at times it does feel that the film was dragging also the first act did feel a bit rushed and i did feel that they could have built on certain aspects of that act orm as a villain was a bit cliched he didnt have any such motivation for his actionsperformances jason mamoa lived through the role of arthur curry from the first scene onwards he just makes you believe that he is strong amber heard complements jasons character nicely patrick wilson was good with what he was given to do william dafoe was good as nuis vulko yahta abdul mateen ii was badass it was god to see dolph ludgren finally nicole kidman and temeura morrison were great as parentsfavorite scene it would be the scene with arthur and mera on the sahara that scene was very funny the jokes were spot on adding to that the scenery was just awesomeverdict if you enjoy big adventure and cgi filled action films then this film is perfect for you if not then i would advise to stay away from the film yes the film is not perfect and has some flaws but i did have a fun time with the film if the makers are planning a sequel they surely have excited me the dc extended universe has definitely redeemed itself and i am looking forward to its future filmsi am going with an 810,fantasy
 is the archetypal good superhero movie it has fun a lot of fun comedy a heros quest action which is remarkably well done and different from the marvel type selfdiscovery and a touch of romancethe downside is a somewhat predictable plot but the joy is in the adventure rather than the story mamoa aces his characterthe underwater theme also gives this film a unique feel that you didnt get in any prior superhero movieand all of this comes from a guy who expected nothing and didnt really wish to even watch it go see it,fantasy
this movie has a lot of heart and puts the viewer in the driver seat as the hero i am just a fan of superheroes in general so i love the mcu and have wanted the dceu to succeed and i have gotta say this movie is a leap in the right direction,fantasy
this movie was enjoyable for me however i only gave it a seven the movie was too busy as if they didnt have enough story so they just had to throw a lot of stuff in there i felt like some of the characters and what their costumes were what a little ridiculous and reminded me of when my kids would watch power rangers,fantasy
i saw this movie expecting a standard dc superhero movie more on the seroius side of things well i havent laughed as much at the movies in a long time we all know how sexy jason momoa is but amplifying it with a rock guitar riff and slowmow hair flip plus sexy stare everytime kicked someones ass was pretty over the top at the beginning i thought it might hae been involuntarily funny but in the end i hope it was intentional the colors the costumes the music the characters the storyline everything was so exagerated that i couldnt take it seriously which in the end made for a really fun watch,fantasy
honestly is a beautifully illustrated story by james wanmade for imax,fantasy
absolutely reached well above my expectations i thought it was going to be a good movie it was totally awesome,fantasy
so the best aquaversion doesnt come from james cameron and vinnie chase anymore but from james wan and jason mamoamamoa is arthur the son of a love affair between a human and the fish queen of atlantis a grownup arthur wants nothing to do with his mothers kingdom but is called upon to stop his halfbrother from starting a war with the surface worldand mamoas got this turning what is a silly looking character into a true son of anarchy he checks off all the boxes the physique the brood the macho roughnecking and the funnyreally the whole cast is excellent here hes got good chemistry with amber heard who trades comic barbs and personal lessons with him and fights well but will be remembered most for thiswillem dafoe shows up sporting a man bun as arthurs former mentor nicole kidman plays arthurs mompatrick wilson plays the halfbrother he does a fine job but runs into the problem that usually plagues marvel villains of having nothing to do after a whilei much preferred manta a villain with a legit reason for wanting revenge on arthurmost of these fish people talk perfectly underwater which is silly but the way theyre able to see underwater is a gorgeous effect that rivals avatarreally everything from the action sequences sets costumes is a fantastical visual is it going for realism well at one point we see an octopus playing bongo drums so you tell mepoint is its pretty zany mix of things you might see in a thor film and pixar film and its funmuch of this focuses on a magical trident and fish people angry over pollution do we care to a point 2 hours and 20 minutes of this is a little much though and there should have been more of an effort to curb thatoverall this is fun thrilling and a visual pleasure with a real star turn from mamoa youll want to see it on a big screenif you like this check out craig james review on youtube for more,fantasy
the film looks very good but honestly its not as good as everyones making it out to be the visuals are amazing however jokes fall flat it trys to be its own superhero movie however it comes off alot like black panther which was much better and also thor ragnarok for a certain scene it is an improvement by dc although i found it quite boring,fantasy
i dont think the people that gave this movie a 9 or 10 have ever seen another movie,fantasy
after seeing today with a near full crowd in imax 2d i have to say that this movie has to be the best super hero movie of the year even better than the two out of three marvel movies ive seen this year ant man and the wasp i have yet to see that take place in their universe not to mention the animated spiderman movie which i might see soon as well as deadpool 2 not interested in the pg13 cut the movie like most dc origin movies takes place at a lighthouse on the east coast in 1985 where is born to an american husband and an atlantian queen and is raised by his underwater friends along the way he will face many foes the most important being black manta if you dont know who that it read the comics as well as watch the super friends cartoon who will play a major role in the upcoming sequel after you see the mid credits scene go see it in imax as that release has an imax exclusive trailer for avengers end game which fills up the screen nicely,fantasy
great movie top 2 dc movie ive seen right behind dark knight,fantasy
i enjoyed this movie very much the visuals the cast jason momoa as you cant go wrong the movie overall was very good the action was amazing no doubt about it and the plot was great too it gave us an indepth history of taught us a lot about dceus atlantis and it was greatmy only issue with the movie which i think ahs escaped everyone and i was the only one who noticed it timeline people this movie is set after the events of justice league so tell me this with all the destruction going and we are talking ships moving into towns and bays explosions and people dying in an italian town and what not dont you think superman would have been there in damned seconds to save the day or the rest of justice league see what i mean by timeline the timeline is wrong i see why they did it that way but it still makes no sense for sups not to be there when all that was happening unless they showed somewhere that superman wasnt on the planet at the time i dont know so for me that was the only plot holeotherwise i highly recommend you go watch this at the cinema it is a good movie worth your money and time,fantasy
very nice and well directed and animated the story is very clean smooth and well choreographedloved the acting and actions,fantasy
i dont understand how anyone can enjoy this lifeless movie clear cash grab cgi fest with no suspense and a terrible plot,fantasy
i do not recommend this movie total waste of time and money,fantasy
this movie threw us in at the deep end and we swam with the fishes it was a great ride that kept our attention from start to finishit was long it was a monumental saga it was cgi gone mad but this was a really great movie and delivered exactly what was on the tinjason momoa gets special mention he gave a solid endearing performance that trod the line of humour selfdeprecation and superheroi loved it,fantasy
the whole movie is awesome including the ending song,fantasy

just now saw the movie cinematography 10vfx  10story  10screenplay  75direction  9acting 10the story is too long for a 2hour 20 mins movie there shouldve been at least additional 30 mins  because of which audience will find the movie to be fast paced especially in the first half but i liked it another tiny flaw even though the dialogues are quite good in this movie  but unfortunately i didnt got any goosbumping dialogues that i got in infinity war but it was washed away by the mindboggling vfx that kept me wowing otherwise everything is almost perfect but most importantly dceu is learning from its mistake a major mistake known as justice league ps  not a marvel fanboy either ,fantasy
with this amazing film dc universe the best movie then marvels origin story even there blockbuster black panther witch stole 3 plots from 3 different movies,fantasy
dear dc fans here is finally played in indonesian theaters jason mamoa wooowww of course he is beyond perfect amber heard is so much improved and proved herself as part of dc heroes this movie also remarks that james wan could produce a very good action packed superhero movie this is a really sexy movie with bold characters beautifully built to make us want to live in the ocean the plots are combination with gentle romance of love origin of superhero the appearance of politics under the water kingdoms and also some real footages about global warming in this globalization world perhaps humankind just felt guilty about what happened in our oceans but here the main idea is how far a population could defend the existence of their kingdom and how much the power to have peace than to do war peace and war is finally seen in the actions of as the master of ocean king of atlantis and the peacemaker of earth and the sea never denied his hidden identity but at the same time he felt guilty as the death of his mother on the other side his halfbrother doesnt want to approve as his family family conflict then becomes international issue with the timing of global warming against the existence of the ocean kingdoms credited by profitable scientists who argue and debate for the myth of atlantis itself atlantis is protected by the trisula and the appearance of trisula many times trisula is also the symbol of triangle form of trisula is somehow a perfection balance and solid ground theory to do more and more to be the best and unbeatable foundation of lifes aspects to support the main story we are being told the insight in his trisula stages in child times growing up and being mature that all directed us to his identity to be himself but by scarifying some of his ego in land base to be united with sea base being defeated then cameback and tried to be peace maker the beautiful editing finalization professional special effects cool back sounds and soft developing characters make us believe that ocean has a more beautiful underwater kingdom than the bad political condition above on the earth all details are so real this movie will stay for a very long time in our heart and make us want to live in the ocean,fantasy
the movie should be called aqua bore i was bored from start to finish,fantasy
after arthur curry aka aqua man was properly introduced in justice league i felt the character was lacking and wasnt given enough material to work with justice league left a bland taste in my mouth but im very happy to say aqua man is excellentessential its the dc equivalent of thor ragnarok the visuals are amazing with an explosion of colours on screen which were actually goosebump inducing at times and the action is the best seen in the dceu yet the choreography and wide camera shots mean you can track every fight scene and really see the impact of the fight the battles are just epic in scale and destructionthe story has definitely cemented arthur currys place in the dceu much like what was done with diana in wonder woman at times it is silly a bit cheesy but honestly it works in favour of the character i couldnt see a gritty aqua man film working because look at the character material85  9,fantasy
really i mean it gl was arguable better than this one i think this one had a number of name actors from various tracks from earlier spiderman franchise from the watchmen franchise and so on the childhood trips down memory lane felt forced and in large part i think entirely unnecessary there was a pseudo archvillain miniorigin inside this sortoforiginsortofjlsequel namely that of black manta which was i think kind of a funny subplot dig on the old super friends franchise but all we got from bm was a minor skirmish and a rather ignominious demise we do get a teaser in the postcredits though if you know the reference you know what i am talking about but he was really just a tool in the movie used by the political coup over tones so many plots and subplots in this one the film really didnt know what it wanted to be an origin or a sequel it would have been interesting to see a couple of cameos of jl heroes but with the depth of the cast i can see why that would be difficult last but not least really this one was pretty bad imo and gives the gl movie a run for its money for its stench just one mans opinion fwiw,fantasy
title says it all really time i will never get back,fantasy
there was tons of potential for a good story but they didnt really develop a storyline much they instead only gave a bunch of cgi and fight scenes mainly and the acting not that great even though it had tons of great actors in it jason momoa is so good in game of thrones and i was a bit shocked at his performance because it was not very good,fantasy
this film caught me by surprise by how bad it was while the effects and the underwater world were nice the entire movie was lacking a smart script and storyline that can drow the viewer in however packed with cliche jokes pointless characters too long battle scenes to the point of yawning and a very childish like design of the enemies is clearly a great actor who drew attantion with his drooling body but after 15 minutes the lure is gone and the very long film could have easily cut 40 minutesamber heard lacks charisma and her only role being in the film was clearly to creata a romance interest for the lead actor which is flat out boringthe best part in the film was nicole kidmans story which was sadly only a fracture of the film maybe they should have done a movie about her story instead of,fantasy
 sets itself aside from the rest of the dc films by being what in my opinion is the best the franchise had to offer so far comparisons are bound to be made with the franchises other arguable hit wonder woman personally i think beats wonder woman in that it had a final act that had a battle that was so visually appealing and interesting to look at that it absolutely blows wonder womans failure of a third act out of the waterwhich really is the story of success it is a film that is wonderful to look at the visual aspect of this film is that of a completely new level with underwater shots and cgi that is groundbreaking and something that audiences have never seen before the film had an interesting villain in ocean mater his motivations were well justified as the best villains shouldboth jason momoa and amber heard were brilliant as arthur and mera as director james wan excellently blends the actors own traits into the characters utilizing momoas culture in the form of war cries and tribal tattoos to establish this new and modernized version of is bound to wow audiences while its not the most interesting story wise it definitely sets itself apart as a fun and thrilling explosion of colours and visuals,fantasy
 2018 was a highly anticipated film for fans of the dceu with the release of wonder woman 2017 getting praised by critics warner brothers seemed to have stepped up their game in comparison to marvel studios when the trailer first dropped excitement among dc universe fans was split many people were very excited for the upcoming film whereas others thought the trailer seemed very cheesy and their excitement for the film began to die out then the movie hit theatersthe beginning of the film is interesting mother washes up on some rocks in maine during a thunderstorm when father sees her he takes her into his home and she is scared at first until she passes out on his couch when she wakes up she eats his goldfish right in front of him after a little bit of conversation she reveals that she is the queen of atlantis this is one of the many very weird scenes it is discussed that many people believe in atlantis and the existence of atlantians and we can assume that father is one of them this is a very funny moment in the movie later they conceive years later some atlantian soldiers come to take back their queen after a slowmotion fight scene with many awkward camera angles she goes with them it is told to the audience later that she dies the movie spends so much time on the fact that she is dead that it is such a shock when she is revealed to be alive though her character remains flat and adds little emotion she is also used as a plot device to get and his brother to stop fighting laterthe conflict between and his brother is forced they both decide they mutually hate each other for stupid reasons they both say they want to kill the other and both reluctantly accept that the the other will have to dieblack mantas character in this film is useless and stupid the characters are only ever running from him and they always escape he is provided with atlantian armor and then he suddenly knows everything about is and is an engineer as he does work on the armor and paints it black he makes a comment about how he will need a bigger helmet and the next time we see him he has a comically large helmetevery time there is any important dialogue between and his love interest there is also an explosion it is pretty lame and ridiculous nobody is ever affected by the explosions and there are way too many in the filmthere is also an attack on atlantis by the surface world and it is never explained who attacked atlantis or why nobody on the surface world knows about this attack it is only ever mentioned a couple more times in the filmthere are very kidlike dialogues in this film however the movie is very visually appealing the colors are astounding as well as the cgi if you are looking for an action packed very serious movie then this is not for you if you are looking for a hilariously bad superhero movie then this is for you,fantasy
i actually thoroughly enjoyed this movie i felt jason mamoa is not comic book red head pale skinned which after thinking about it made no sense especially since the story of atlantis are not pale skinned gingers i liked manta their fight scene could have been a little longer but you care more about the brother rivalry special effects were also super good i hope this is a turning point for dc they now have 2 good movies and an abundance of bad ones next up is shazam,fantasy
the headline above is true when i was little my mom rented me the old cartoon that inspired me to swim the whole movie is beautifully done shoutout to james wann for making my dream come true of making a hero not a joke  the effect so beautifully done with the water effects great acting jason momoa and probably the best villian of the dceu black manta king orm and the trenchi give this a 10 for best everything although make the romance a tad better and you got a success,fantasy
not too much to say here except that this is probably the best super hero movie ive ever seen non stop spectacular action and jaw dropping spectacles for solid 2 and half hours if you are not against having a blast and be awe struck go see this movie now its best to be seen in 3d ultra avx theater with recliner seat ive almost given up going to the movie theater for the last few years i only went because i got some free movie passes boy was i floored it reminded me the magic of going to the movies from years ago im not going to talk about the plot here its pretty much in the trailer and if you have not been living under the rock for the most of your life youve probably know or heard something about the legend of atlantis anyway go see it now support this movie to show hollywood what kind of movies we want so they will make more of these kind of movies,fantasy
i went in to this movie with very low expectations dc movies tend to be very inconsistent with their movies so even though i really liked the trailer i really liked bvss trailer as well but we all know how that movie turned out wonder woman did really well and was quite a solid movie so im hoping that this movie will be on par with wonder woman and i must say it was so freaking amazing ive heard before going in that it feels like a marvel phase 1 movie like thor or something and to some extent i agree but in my opinion this movie feels like it has a very simple premise but somehow their execution was so damm well that it turned out better than it should have been and im not mad at allid like to discuss about certain aspects of the movie like the plot cgi setting all those goodies as well as running down the characters list to check out each actor and actresses individual performance first off i must say the plot is actually pretty simple the whole arc of the movie revolves around aruther distinguishing the idea between king and hero he also has to learn to get over the hold everything responsible trope and learn to take on responsibility as the king i thought that the movie did really well trying to conveys this through mera and aruthers first encounter where we dive straight into the issue that aruther must learn to overcome as well as i think the most important scene in the movie which is mera and aruthers talk on the boat where he has to learn to accept reality and stop doubting himselfspeaking of aruther lets talk about the himself he feels very real and although i didnt initially liked the casting of jason mamoa as hes grown on me and really like all the emotional scenes he has with mera his mother and everyone else he really does sell the idea and director james wan makes the character seem very genuine and relatable mera was great shes how i always thought she should be badass hot and not a damsel in distress her chemistry with aruther was really believable and theyre really good couple and that kiss thoughthe cgi was really breathtaking and just really really good from the underwater swimming scenes to the atlantis structures and scenes to the fight scenes especially the fight scenes freaking amazing theres so much to see in this movie the attention to detail is just really nice to seenow for the villains black manta and ocean master i would just like to say that that their suits are one of the most comic accurate costumes ive seen in a while and its just very nice to see black manta was pretty good in this movie i liked that they were able to integrate an origin story of sorts into the movie without making too forced black manta was a nice addition but wasnt really needed and was just here to set up the sequel ocean master on the other hand who i thought was going to a joke in this movie was actually not that bad of a villain i mean he does have his own twisted motivation it makes sense and he is menacing while doing it so kudos to the actor i particularly like his and aruthers exchange before their first fight because it showed not only his motivations but the conflict between and him and thus showing a clash in ideologies which i lovethe father and mother of aruther storyline was quite boring and put aside i didnt really cared for either of them and when it was revealed spoiler alert that aruthers mother was still alive it really wasnt that surprising and honestly the movie could probably have been the same without her showing up oh wellif i had one more complaint it would be that the plot was quite predictable and there were no twist or surprises no cameos as well but thats it i cant think i anything else i didnt likeoverall this a very solid movie full with exciting action pieces compelling characters and beautiful visuals id say its the perfect family movie or blockbuster movie and if you have the time which you should have its christmas you should definitely give this movie a try,fantasy
seriously you guys have to go and see it im no comic movie fan a friend recommended this and i watched it and it was beautifully good its a whole new experience,fantasy
jason is awesomeepic cgiaction scene are greatblack manta seeing greatking orm looks r goodwait for sequel,fantasy
i will just say that this movie is not terrible so theres that but its literally just 2 hours of world building and cgi its boring this is certainly one of the better dceu movies in recent years as it isnt as ridiculous as bvs and it isnt a broken dumpster fire like suicide squad but at the same time if the best dc has managed to do in recent years is this and wonder woman which was only decent then i dont think this cinematic universe thing is gonna take off i get that quite a few people like this movie and in the end thats fine but this movie made me incredibly bored by the half way point and this movie tries to be retro a lot and while i appreciate the effort it just came off as jarringits an average movie with glimmers of a great one throughout but theyre only that glimmers,fantasy
no spoilers just watch you will enjoy everything 143 minutes and you wont get bore,fantasy
 is a movie that deserves to be loved the way james wan told the story was incredible and the acting was also quite natural and on the top the vfx and cgi was that good that ive never seen before i love this movie for me this is the best movie of 2018,fantasy
i would like to remind the so called movie critics that this is a comic book movie just have fun and enjoy it this movie entertains you and brings you to a beautiful visual world by using great characters and story to the critics if you go into a movie with a bias you will always find something wrong with it this movie brings the story from the comics to the big screen in a very respectful way from the source material and that is why i liked it,fantasy
phenomenal outstanding beautiful easily the best film i have seen this year i can not get over just how incredible this film is or put into words just how much i enjoyed it from start to finish and to be honest i didnt have incredibly high hopes for it but it has proven me wrong in every way what a masterpiece see it for yourselves and just e joy that fantastic ride,fantasy
best fantasy movie since lord of the ringsjames wan saved dceu from drowninggreat come back for dc comicsif any other says the movie was bad then they should be from different universe,fantasy
there are too many marvel fanbabies crying here with bad reviews but this movie will stand above all the hatesthis movie is a visual treat for everyone if you watch it in better theatre yes story is predicable which is not new for any superhero origin story bcz we know it all from the comics itself the action scenes are out of the world james wan shines like a trident acting are okayish but the visuals throws all the minor negatives for good great popcorn movie of this year period,fantasy
love the story love how their imagination for the movie end of this year see the amazing movie vfx is amazing,fantasy
i already watched the movie and i have many points regarding the time line and its relation to jls first of all how did he know meera in jl and in this movie like he is seeing her for the first time in this movie they mentioned steppenwolf even before she introduces her self toin addition in jl he cant talk underwater and in this movie he learned to talk when he was youngalso he went to atlantis in jl to fight steppenwolf and meeting meera while in this movie he is just seeing atlantis for the first time again these events happened after discussing steppenwolf fightfinally this movie is not aligned with what happened in jlmy rating 510,fantasy
cgi wauw actors super story more than ok action super,fantasy
beautiful film  with great action and good plot ,fantasy
this movie was  well it was jason momoa was absolutely edible but the movie was well it was  i dont really know what the heck it was i just hope they never  ever  ever make a 2  just let it go dc,fantasy
atlantis was great but amanda heard was gorgeous especially those damn beauteous mountains,fantasy
as a woman i am not a big fan of comic books from either dc or marvel however watching this movie at the theater without any previous knowledge or history of the leading character hero but i actually enjoyed this film the plot was solid which held a good story filled with action and suspense supported with good acting i admired the relationship with mera and arthur working together to save atlantis and the prevention of a war between the worlds of ocean and land i also enamored with nicole kidmans motherly affection for her two sons,fantasy
this movie was a lot of fun jason momoa killed it in the lead role was funny and badass him and aber heard also had some charming and even cute chemistry the effects and action are also serviceable exciting but nothing mindblowing atlantis looks beautiful if not a little busy this is a cgi heavy film but thats hardly at fault since there is really no other way to faithfully present such an imaginative landscape as it takes place inthere is also a level of the heart to it that is simple but effective enough its not without its cheesiness though lots of over the top creatures and patrick wilsons villain but they all fit at the end of it all this film can be viewed simply as a fun creative action romp with a good deal of exaggerated landscapes and the characters found in those landscapes that seem to know what kind of movie theyre in its epic and fun and despite the simple tired story is one of the dceus better outings it has a color where the others were grainy and charisma where the others were stoic a solid change of pace,fantasy
how on earth is this rated anywhere above 5 it starts off laughably bad and i mean almost parody bad so bad i asked my 13 year old comic book movie fan boy son if hed got ya watching some sort of joke youtube version nope this was the real movieas bad and as laughable the first 20 minutes are soon seem like shawshank redemption compared to what followstrying to be all the best bits of the marvel movies such as ragnorok guardians etc and ending up looking more like lazytownhonestly this is utterly dreadful whatever you don dont waste any money buying this on vod or dvd  bluray please,fantasy
it is stupidnot much more to say about iti have typed these extra words to keep imdb happy keep yourself happy by not wasting your time if an adult,fantasy
 is just another reminder why the film industry sucks so badly these days everything now just revolves around overhyped superhero garbage and this movie is no exceptionall the characters are flat and one dimensional as others have stated despite the fact there are some big name actors in this movie and none of the jokes and humor is funny in any way if anything its just annoying as hell the visual effects are good but again its nothing we havent seen before to honest i think avatar had better visuals and that movie is now fast approaching its tenth birthdayill never understand why there was so much hype for this movie because it will be forgotten about very quickly,fantasy
the dialogue is childish nonsense  comparable to the badly translated english subtitles of an old chinese kung fu moviesummary this is yet another over hyped piece of cartoonish garbage that sits perfectly alongside black panther as an over acclaimed b grade movie with lots of pretty colors and lights for the children but little else for those with an iq above 90,fantasy
probably the worst super hero movie ever i and my family have ever seen so much cheese you need a pack of crackers to watch this i just havent the words its like a bad shampoo advert meets the power rangers do yourself a favour and go and watch a marvel movie at least they make good cgi movies unlike this over the top over budget priced cheese fest i just cant say anything more than to ask father time for the hours back what did i just see dear god,fantasy
what director or writer thought about a movie about hairy tattooed and a mermaid and to go one fighting whales sharks and so on on on,fantasy
wow what an epic fail that script the story line is cringing dont know why they bothered using actors for it the entire movie was basically cgi  most boring movie of 2018 will not be watching again nor its second instalment,fantasy
this movie compelled me to create an imdb account not because it was an amazing example of american cinema but because it was the worst movie i have ever seeni am not going to go into detail about all the poor choices made by the producers screenwriters director and actorsim just going to say that there is plenty of blame to go around simply put there was no part of this movie i enjoyed,fantasy
this is the best film i ever seen full movie unique excellent ,fantasy
its kinda fresh movie for the dceu since its not dark compared to the other dceu movies it had lots of great visuals and very great cinematography the performances by the lead actors was very very good and the chemistry onscreen between jason momao and amber head was beautiful,fantasy
honestly it was so bad i was laughing deliriously it makes power rangers seem tolerable the actors of this film will regret signing on to this movie just dont bother,fantasy
dont waste your money wait for the dvd better yet skip that as well,fantasy
its been about 25 years since ive watched power rangers tv series and somehow james wan nailed it even with all and technological advances in cinemaaverage movie and bit over the top with a bunch of cliches james wan over did it numerous times how do you hire a director with a horrrorthriller background and not have one ounce of it in the movie everything is predictable when i went to film school your taught tone james missed this concept completely by jumping around everywhere batman felt like batman throughout the whole movie in i didnt know if i was watching a comedy romance action or dark action what the hell waa going on excited muchacting was decent dp was fairly goodentertaining movie to watch with the kids nothing worthy of a clap,fantasy
ive decided to write my first ever review to try and get down in words how bad this film actually isim in utter disbelief at how highly rated this film is for how bad it actually is at the time of this review is rated 7510 anyone interested in films or movies if youre outside the uk should be frustrated by the levels of cheesiness cheap oneliners and bad acting are off the charts when was first presented to us in justice league there was no cheesiness if anything it was dark and quite gritty he didnt want to be known and he was rough around the edgesi literally found myself cringing throughout the whole of the film im still amazed that they played pitbulls remix of africa by toto just because they flew over the sahara  cheese and the sand slide down into the crevice  ripoff of the ice slide scene from ice age embarrassingly and the indiana jones ripoff  couldve just spit on the gadget instead of pulling moisture out of his head and the underwater battle scenes are basically just spaceship scenes with a few bubbles thrown in for good measure  star trek ripoff just terriblei gave this film 310 to explain 1st star for amber heard because shes tidy 2nd star for the effort gone into the cgi and the 3rd start because this film gave me an excuse to have a nandos beforehand if you know you knowi feel sorry for anyone who paid to see this james wan stick to horror films,fantasy
to make it short too long for the story thats told which is full of holes and straightforward illogical bad acting especially between the two leads and other than cgi there is nothing memorable that will make you think about the film after 2 weeks plus the absolute worst villian ever in a superhero movie seriously if i am the poor guy that had to wear that helmet i would laugh my way off the setseriously go see wonder woman if you want a passable dc movie,fantasy
went in with high hopes given the rating and was thoroughly let down character development was most flawed followed by piles of illogical scenes such as why ride a shark when you can move through the water at will why have giant propellers to battle underneath in the final scene when your vessels do not use propellers for propulsion how can you jump out of an airplane and crash on the ground unscathed yet get hurt when falling 1 story found it easier to turn off my brain and not think about it,fantasy
 was very stunning visually and the story really connected to the comics jason momoa did an amazing job once again potraying and this movie did not disappoint however some bits and pieces from the comics were missing but that is not really a big deal wonderful job from dc comics,fantasy
jason momoa is yet another hyped up actor in a big budget film kinda similar to when vin diesel was in xxx and women watched it mainly just to see the star and his muscles it seems in todays society in hollywood there is no quality films with storytelling and good actors its all just cgi bs and superheroes lame these types of movies are for kids eye candy visuals with no substance,fantasy
this movie to me was spectacular all around i was pleasantly surprised at both the earthy human love elements and quick spots of humor that subtly permeated the movie  how arthur came into being incidents at various points of his childhood and how he was trained as a warrior you dont see that in many superhero movies oh yeah there was that wonder woman movie i loved arthurs reluctant hero attitude smart mouth and negative view toward his mothers people how would you feel about them if you knew what he knewthe story line was straightforward and clear the bad guys werent really without cause but still needed to be put down and the movie did not drag along actually the action was virtually nonstop throughout the movie the casting was awesome momoa kidman heard dafoe and wilson seemed to be made for their roles  most of all jason momoa who but he could have done as well as arthurand the cgigraphic portions of the movie were amazing james wan was able to let it all hang out here  i think partially because a lot of the movie takes place under water we get a chance to see cgi in all its threedimensional glory i remember thinking while watching that i had not seen such visually stunning scenes in a movie since avatar  and no im not saying this movie in any way matches up with avarar just some of the amazing visual aspectsthis is an outstanding movie go see it on the big screen,fantasy
i expected the movie to be fun but i did not expect an lotr sized spectacle this movie blew me away on so many different levels it was impossible to scale this adventure from the outset i found it to be over the top in all the best ways this was something i would have expected out of an avengers sized movie really it was to the scale you wished justice league would have been phenomenal loved every second people rating this 6 stars and less need to have their head examined,fantasy
when watching this film i was amazed by how the film looked and i was very entertained i enjoyed this film more than wonder women which i would give a seven but well deservers an eight and is awesome film that i recommended watching,fantasy
the last superhero movies i loved were thor ragnarok and avengers infinity war  everything else was enjoyable for the most part but not nearly as good in my opinionwith this movie dc finally proved they can produce equal cinema experiences they have crafted something that is worth watching multiple times and it works so much better like wonder woman which i didnt think was that great as everyone made it out to bewhy would i give it a 10cinematography seriously some stunning shots that you could frame and hang in your living room concept artists outdid themselves here the art department deserves praisei loved the play with color choices in some scenes when blue was the bad side  even though there was no bad really here  and red the good opposing sidethe cgi was on another level i dont think we have seen something equal before the underwater shots breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly well designed and craftedcharacters and plot were on point everyone had reasonable motives and i havent noticed any illogical motives or choices which was refreshing to say the leastthere is cheesiness but the movie isnt trying to cover it and for some reason it really really works well even the kiss scene is amazingly well donethere are jokes but not forced or overdone like in guardians of the galaxyit just suits jason mamoa who is a greati just hope dc keeps on rolling on this wave and doesnt get lazy after this first movie so please dc keep this upregarding bad reviewsi cannot understand the mediocre reviews i have read since this was clearly one of the best superhero movies of all time and if we are honest even marvel loves clicheesbut after all we all have different tastes and thats something to be expected and needs to be accepted some people didnt like interstellar or bladerunner 2049 which i thought were one of the best movies i have ever watched,fantasy
so honestly best dc universe in my opinion it drifts away from the dark gloomy nature of dc films and is bright and colorful with jokes and adventure thrown in however it still holds its depth and is a well written and visually stunning film,fantasy
how many people were paid to write great reviews of this boring movieit is boring long and cheap looking the only scenes that i enjoyed were the closeups of amber heardenough said,fantasy
how can a director make look bad amber heardthat movie is awfuly boring and senselesspoor momoa he deserved betterthe movie seems like a parody of masters of the universe but underwaterno character developmentabsurd situationsbad production desingbad dialogueyou feel the movie is 10 minutes lengthbut 10 minutes underwater and no oxygen maskdo yourself a favor and skip this one,fantasy
so i watched and i have to say it has quickly become one of my favourite superhero movies together with the dark knight and the deadpool moviesthe visuals costumes and cgi are stunning the musical score is great the fight scenes are beautifully shot and choreographed but most important all the characters are very well fleshed out with motivations and complete arcs especially the villains and himself the movie is epic in scope and the climax is very satisfying 100 recommend,fantasy
the movie is visually impressive ill give it that the underwater battle scene with opposing sides on sea horses and sharks was exceptionally well done story wise though it was fairly formulaic and quite honestly after about the first hour or so i started getting bored with it the dialog in particular was rather mundane for such a high profile movie coming out of the dc comics universe when jason momoa response to one of his beleaguered foes cant even remember who that was now was screw you i could only groan in embarrassment this is not what i expected to be coming from the mouth of the future king of atlantisi thought jason momoa was a very good choice for the role he has a regal bearing even before his destiny is revealed and i think hes a credit to the dc universe maybe it was amber heards brilliantly rendered red hair but i couldnt warm up to her character as mera future queen the rest of the alist cast was generally ok although personally i dont think nicole kidman should come anywhere near superhero movies based on comic booksthough my rating of the movie is favorably high its all due to the cinematography and capable cgi utilized by the film makers the after credits sequence sets up the sequel with black manta yahya abdulmateen ii who didnt impress me this time around as the second tier villain behind king orm patrick wilson his look was kind of cheesy and too cartoony for my tastes perhaps a bad harbinger for the follow up flickas an aside i couldnt get over the huge amount of one line reviews this picture has here on imdb since it came out they really offer nothing in the way of an individual writers support or distaste for the movie other than to say they like it or hated it could do that in a tweet i guess that says im in favor of going back to the ten line requirement that imdb used to have,fantasy
before i start know that i know nothing about aside from the many jokes about how he can talk to fishso i went to see the movie and frankly i enjoyed it a lot the visuals are excellent with vibrant intense colors but i will have to give you a seizure warning if you have an issue humour and nice action the characters were written decently and the pacing was nice enough so that no point in the movie became boringi had my doubts about the director since all i could see were horror movies but the guy knew just what the movie needed and props to the guy to know just when the movie had to be dark and when it had to be lighti hope i dont trigger a lot of you but my ranking of the dceu films so far iswonder womanjustice leaguebatmanvsupermansuicide squadthe reason i put above is that wonder woman reminds me a bit of captain america the first avengerto conclude resparked my interest in dc movies since the director knew the proper style he had to use and im hopeful that the new dceu movies will have directors that know their stuff and we dont have another dark dc movie unless the hero fits it,fantasy
some of these reviews are rated ridiculously low while others may be overrating it a bit to me it was a good movie with its bad moments here and therei tried to go into this movie as unbiased as possible especially after justice league but it really wasnt all that bad it had its cheesycringey moments and it had its really great moments the first hour maybe hour and a half of the movie dragged on a little but it picked up the pace pretty fast after thati think it did a great job explaining the origin and enjoyable for those who love sci fi just go watch it for yourselves instead of going solely off these reviews,fantasy
yes yes yes thats all i can say about the movie kicking snyder to the curb was the best idea ever please learn from that mistake and never let snyder in the directors chair again whoever the director is needs all the money cars women and homes whatever it takes for him to do the rest of the dcu movies please,fantasy
outside of the batman flicks from the 90s christopher nolans batman and wonder woman which was really just ok dc has fallen flat with every attempt at live action i was expecting the same let down but was pleasantly surprised to see they actually got one right some might think there was too much cgi but its a comic book movie so im ok with it casting was great decent story and good lead into the next installment,fantasy
what a film  it had sad parts funny parts and enough action to have you on the edge of your seat im super excited for the sequel,fantasy
we went to see the movie a few days ago after the movie my wife was in love with and my son who was skeptic before the movie was amazed and enjoyed the film there are many haters out there that want dc extended universe to fail i just have an answer to them keep hatting guys but dc extended universe is getting better and better just stop hatting and enjoy the movies dont read the crap everyone writes go see the movie and have your own opinion watch the movie and enjoy it as i and my family did,fantasy
sure it doesnt know its a comedy but it made me laugh all the way through,fantasy
the overall movie left you always on the edge of your seat waiting for the next moment really smooth transition a must see best dc movie to date,fantasy
amazing movie worth watching  visuals  story everything is just perfect,fantasy
this was a waste of my time the movie had great visuals and the beginning introduction to the queen was good because of that i will give it a five i am being kind to give this movie a five the dialogue was horrible the acting was really bad and the writing script was a mess i am a dc fan and was very disappointed they destroyed i grew up watching and reading about and the sea creatures that was loyal to him this movie didnt capture the relationship had with the sea creatures instead they attempted to copy star wars with enemy soldiers and all of the special effects if you want to see a movie with lots of special effects ridiculous fight scenes stupid costumes and poor actors then this movie is for you by the way amber heard cannot act she was absolutely horrible,fantasy
where are the cameos none were needed which is what happens when a movie is well thought out to say this movie is visually stunning is an understatement and every reason you need as to why you should go see it on the big screen choose your theater wisely you could tell the theater i was at had a dated projection and sound system which hindered the overall experience it was the equivalent of watching a movie on an old 720p tv with the built in sound instead of a state of the art oled 4k with 72 surround sound or better this movie is fun for everyone and there isnt a bunch of random characters making appearances and detracting from the story line sorry mcu take the whole family and prepare yourself for a great evening,fantasy
i really enjoyed this filmexcellent ensemble cast very engaging story and mamoa personified the character that is kudos for a job well done,fantasy
i thought it was entertaining and had an interesting plot the visual effects were amazing i kept thinking oh my gosh how much did that one shot cost but for being a mostly cgi movie it worked and it made me think a live action version of the little mermaid may be possible after all and the action sequences actually held my interest what i think a lot of people will not like about this movie is that it had more of a comic booky feeling than the others but thats probably why i liked it with that being said it meant that the costumes were laughably overthetop i would say the weakest aspect of the movie is the acting which is pretty sub par especially from the 2 leads and teenage self that acting was cringeworthy overall between this film and wonder woman i think dc may have a chance of catching up to marvel,fantasy
great movie excellent cinematography to start and amazing action scenes as well really loved aquas sense of humor and enjoyed watching the development of mantis as one of the series main villains for futures to come i believe that the dc extended universe has been panned a little too harshly by critics and that despite that it can recover is the sure fire hit for wb that helps the universe reclaim itself well done,fantasy
hands down one of the best movies ive ever seen do yourself a favour and go see this on the big screen,fantasy
it deserves the same recognition as the good marvel movies i seriously dont get the haters of this movie how is it a boring one the once who havent watched it this is definitely a must watch for all audiences,fantasy
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie one of the coolest visual experiences in movies ive seen was absolutely worth the price of imax the picture action battles colors everything looked incredible havent seen a movie this colorful since avatar highly recommend watching in the biggest screen format possible,fantasy
absolutely enjoyed every minute of i am glad  that not listened to the critics about this movie i am not familiar much with the dc universe  i was watching this movie as a random movie goer  and after 5 mins i have decided already that i wanna see it again love jason momoa so much and amber was breathtakingly beautiful  filled with action spectacular  it was a perfect way for me to spend christmas cant wait for the next instalment ,fantasy
its like watching earths version of avatar though the story is mostly predictable at some point we know whats going to happen but that doesnt stop us from immerse ourselves in stunning visuals ambers performance is jaw dropping,fantasy
this movie is an absolute riot there is obnoxious explosions toilet and pee humor octopi playing drums you name it sure it is a very pretty movie and has some epic fight scenes but it is a 2h 22m joke where everything is exaggerated and overthetop in every way imaginable whether its drama action or dialogue i like it,fantasy
i really wanted to movie to be just as good as wonder woman or even on the same level my kids went because we love superhero movies mcu and dc alike but this one seemed like it had a check list of items to make sure were in the movie i was with the plot until the middle and then they began to lay on the cheese there was enough cheese in the second half that i could have gotten constipated if this was a dish to eat go because you like but dont set the bar to high you might leave feeling let down,fantasy
one word for this movieawesome costume is amazing jason momoa is must see movie,fantasy
this movie is fun for the family jason momoas humor is great acting is incredible in all aspects of the film it was an absolute grand slam family guy and my kids loved it i loved it wife absolutely loves momoa now shes crushing hard hats off fantastic job amazing can not wait for the next one,fantasy
if you read the critics it almost sounds like this movie is horrible and not worthy of your time my mantra for this movie like for many others is do not listen to others go and watch it for yourself only after you experienced the movie only then you can have an informed decision about it if i wanted to be treated to a philosophical debate about a meaning of life or culture i would not go to a movie theater i would read books a movie is an escape from reality an entertainment so to speak in order to decompress does just that its pure entertainment topped with stunning visual effects to see the underwater city is worth alone to give it a try,fantasy
great movie why isnt james wan directing all the movies of the dcu,fantasy
let me start by saying that is a visual masterpiecedirection is goodacting is on pointfight scenes are breath taking and are shot in wide so you can see everythingsoubd design really makes you feel like you are under water with them and every punchkickhit feels like it has some serious weight behind it should be celebrared by seeing it on the biggest screen possible,fantasy
a very good movie though i dont like dc so much but i think this is the greatest movie from them than other superheroes in dc comics,fantasy
 is not spiderman but he is amazingbest dc movie after wonder woman and oh manit is candy go watch it and u wont regret every peny finished,fantasy
the story was solid you know what was going to happen since the beggining but its nothing new in superhero films honestly the acting was good solid 710 for me but the effects are what gives the film 910 it was just outstanding propably best ive ever seen keep it up dc it is definitely the right way to go,fantasy
its a mess no emotional bound with the characters it does not matter if someone diesit wants to be to much at once star wars under sea indiana jones  but with no character development it just doesnt go anywhere the story is also really boring no surprise hereonly the sfx is nice but i rather have a decent story above nice sfxdisappointed,fantasy
i just dont have words to describe this it has been one of the best feelings james is just a masteri feel iike i will see this at least 10 times moremy favorite hero movie ,fantasy
i am a huge fan of comic book movies and while the dc universe movies are no where near as close to the avengers movies i still enjoyed and rate highly the majority of what dc has brought to the big screen recently however i was expecting big things from jason mamoas character in based on his performance in justice league and maybe that was the problem with this movie is that my expectations were not met by a long shot mamoas appeal is his raw crudeness as a character but he comes across less than sophomoric and actually quite boring i think dc was trying to bring a thorlike character to strong but humorous in nature but they missed the mark greatly mamoas dialogue is weak and wasnt even slightly funny so basically momoas is more of a supporting actor in my opinion and hasnt yet risen to lead actor nicole kidmans performance was fantastic and so was amber heards even dafoe wilson and lundgren did great jobs in their character which probably made mamoa look even weaker i imagine it is tough to look like a star when playing alongside movie greats like kidman and dafoesecond issue i had with the film is the writing the story is weak and predictable if this had been a premarvel universe movie such that it had come out prior the epic series by marvel i would have given the movie much closer to a perfect score because it was cinematically well done but that is just it it now competes and measures up against what marvel is doing and it is no where close the movie feels selfcontained and focuses on delivering a jawdropping visual adventure while forgetting the story the graphic visualization of atlantis and the underwater battles are fantastic but that is just it it overwhelms the audience and leaves the story to just that a battle of good against evil with nothing else there is no superman or batman or flash or even wonder woman that make an appearance to somewhat tie the movies together so if you like the selfcontained movie in a box experience this isnt bad but if you wanted to see a dc universe film that extends justice league concept i am not sure you will find it here,fantasy
an excellent movie with incredible special effects there is no better criticism than what one can do so go see it at the movie theater you will not regret it,fantasy
after wonder woman something really good has come from dc it was really necessary for their come back a truely exceptional and fantastic visual of the world under water some cgi shots were a little bit cracked but the whole was fabulous the movie was too long but it didnt feel boring for a moment each and every shots were enjoyable with a strong story built up is the true king of dc,fantasy
i dont care that much about this dceu stuff the movie itself had very good visual effects specially if you watch it in 3d but somewhat clumsy story telling and very medicore acting,fantasy
to me looks like batman vs superman in terms of cgi exagerated nice storytelling some jokes but eh nothing looks like natural even armors in general godzilla surprised me sometimes mutu and godzilla looks very real in this movie dont,fantasy
this was a comic book movie through and through and i loved every minute of it great visuals great story tons of action from start to finish im no critic and i dont listen to them either i watch what i think im going to like and i loved this it is now my favorite dc movie see it for yourself,fantasy
an entertaining movie with amazing visual effects epic shots and fight scenes but the story is really fast paced it pretty feels like what will happened if we combine all hobbits movies into oneit follows a compacted linear storyline with multiple character origins i felt pushed through the movie rather than lead through the plot dialogue seems rushed just to get to another panorama or fight scenes basically travel talk boom fight travel talk boom fight there are no space between scenes or conversations to take in what happenedplus the treasure hunting in the movie is a bit forced they get to a place spend minimal time searching and instantly found the next clue and repeatin comparison to other dceu movies fight sequences and visuals are on par or even better but the writing is just not that good,fantasy
this is how you should direct a comic based storystunning visuals and pacementits more than what we expectdont miss the theatre experience,fantasy
im at a bit of a quandary about how to review here its not good thats fair to say but ive a strange feeling its about as good as its ridiculous source material would allow it to bejason momoa is arthur curry hilariously hes supposed to be 29 years old hes also the son of atlanna fleeing queen of atlantis nicole kidman and tom a lighthouse keeper played in unconvincing deaging cgi by temurea morrison his halfbrother orm patrick wilson threatens to unite the undersea kingdoms and wage war on the land dwellers so arthur returns home to challenge his brother for control of the undersea realmsso whilst its not really acting as such jason momoa is always watchable and his charisma will carry you through quite a distance the film also has a few decent action sequences along the way particularly the underwater battle that concludes it and the opening fight scene on board a submarine thats about it for the positives thoughon dozens of occasions is laugh out loud hilariously awful the plot is terrible a clich ridden mcguffin hunt a painfully obvious twist towards the end and some awful foreshadowing plot points it has noticeably terrible music choices throughout  a horrible score of pretend wonder the rest of the performances apart from momoa are dreadful particularly willem defoe and dolph lundgren but nobody else comes off particularly well its the script though that should have been drowned from this was your grandfathers knife he was a frogman in world war 2 then they turned their back on him onwards its a terrible collection of recycled everything youve heard before in action movies for the last thirty years its painfully unaware how unfunny it is toothe cgi is patchy happier with real creatures and vehicles than it is with fictional characters it often ignores its own internal logic too at one point curry hangs onto to a building to avoid a ten foot drop  but before and after that he happily falls hundreds of feet and shrugs it off conventional weapons cant damage curry until towards the end where one can nobody runs away when a shark starts to crack an aquarium wallsadly im not convinced there is a better movie possible than this one but im not sure thats any reason to pretend this one is any good,fantasy
the story was a bit dated but that is masked by the likable cast and awesome special effects i found myself amazed at some of the scenes i think it is on par with wonder woman ww had better story but the graphics in are some of best ive seen my advice grab some popcorn and enjoy,fantasy
seriously in need of some fresh ideas but comic book movies sell and they will keep making them as long as they keep making money,fantasy
another actionadventure movie with fun roller coaster and stunning experience of underwater worldthis doesnt feel like a superhero movie at all this movie contains star wars city experience avatar type world exploring uncharted type of adventure final fantasy type of technology you got advanced tech and mythical tech fast furious type of scoring and new type of fighting and choreography the cinematography also is the best point of this movie experiencing this movie in imax or 3d is a mustthe story is kinda simple since this is an adventure movie and thats for me is a safe game from wan since dceu needs to be enjoyed by everyonein the end its not the best dc movie not the worst not the plain one not popcorn type one too but is the movie that you must enjoy and experience,fantasy
james wan just did amazing great special effects great music pretty solid story and acting,fantasy
tired of outer space movies this one is new the action scenes are awesome there were times when i we jumped off our seat well since it was created by the makers of conjouring and insidious,fantasy
the movie was epic and full of funi see no reason why anyone would hate this movie,fantasy
 is an incredibly epic adventure and great fun resulting in one of the best films in the dceu jason momoa is great as arthur curry and surprisingly good at comedy amber heard willem dafoe and nicole kidman all give great supporting performances yayha abdulmateen ii is also really good as black manta and patrick wilson is good as ormocean master james wans direction is incredible resulting in incredible action sequences and the cg is amazing for the most part however the deaging cg at the beginning isnt good,fantasy
this movie has a lot a lot to offer and as a audience it has a lot to take inmannnn greatest visualscgi character development fresh adventureone should definitely watch it,fantasy
i dont normally write reviews on films so im going to keep it short and sweet took the kids to watch this and was really impressed its good to watch a superhero film with a great storywould definitely recommend this to take the family to watch this christmas kept all ages entertained,fantasy
this movie was brilliant visually amazing good job james wan  ,fantasy
heres a superhero movie which is a good one time watch but nothing that youll remember in 30 days the sfx  vfx is great the cast in the movie does a respectable job  the dialogues every now and then are pretty funny however the script is 30 mins too long  somewhere you start looking at your watch in the last half hour or so i do not think the audience will look forward to the next instalment if there is a plan for one,fantasy
i have never written a review but i had to for thisthis film is amazing visually stunning and unlike every other superhero movie its actually different and underwater i cant fault the underwater effects all the cast were great even dolph lungdren wish he had more scenes i like both marvel and dc but i am getting tired of marvels fomula now this is breath of fresh air 1010,fantasy
the best movie ive ever seen  i love the way they make the story and i feel inlove with ihhhhh love it so much,fantasy
dont believe the critics reviews for god sake this had to be the movie with the best visual effects of 2018 and yes i am a marvel fan but dc has my respect for this one the story and acting is also good and you never feel bored throughout the movie must watch,fantasy
  before starting the review a little box office update right now is forth highest grossing superhero movie in china behind just infinity war  venom and age of ultron and with this speed it will probably cross age of ultron and then venom to take the 2nd spot  so i think the box office prospects of the movie are going to be goodnow just for the sake of comparison i think is on the par with batman begins in ranking dc movies behind dark knight  dark knight rises and wonder woman but just like last years thor 3 being the most fun movie of mcu this is the most fun movie of dceu  which is not saying much actually because dceu is not known for being fun and no the jokes of this film doesnt go as high as thor 3 but its still a movie as good as that one another comparisoni mean this movie doesnt go dark ever and honestly m not a big fan of this type of superhero movies  its not like i dislike them  its just something which i dont prefer in comparison to the darker movies likes of batman trilogy and man of steel but in anytime i would prefer a good fun movie then an average darker film and thats what provideshonestly saying the storyline is pretty basic there is not much in the writing section its very much like fast and furious films  having a basic plot and jumping from one location to another for one after another actions sequence not providing much when action is not happening but we still love fast and furious films for its action and its gorgeous visual  and i loved for the samethe imagination and world building is on some other level oscar for best visual effect written all over it far far far better then black panther with which it also had some storyline similarities watching this movie in 3d which i did and if possible in imaxwhich i unfortunately didnt is the best possible way its so grand and gorgeous that it will take another whole review to just discuss about atlantisthe action scenes  they were hard  i mean really really hard another comparison to fast and furious movies every punch in the movie is like a steel punch with heart pumping sound effects u can feel the hurt that the person receiving the punch was feelingunfortunately the only technical department which disappointed me was the music its good in some parts but weird in some other parts never unique  some weird song choices  i mean who needs songs in superhero movies  there 45 of them in this film which is shocking because its the same composer who did wonder woman  which had exceptionally good musicthem comes jason mamoa well he is a below average actor but thats what we got and he managed really well when tough scenes were not provided to them he certainly looks the part and damn good in the action scenes but thats it and i am not complainingin comparison amber heard acted really well i always liked her acting but she has always been considered a b grade average actress with alot of bad movies in her filmography i hope this will changer that thinking nicole kidman didnt get much to do  but got one really small yet great action sceneso its a step in the right direction for dceua line many reviewers are saying because its true lets see what shazam will have in its bag when it will release next year8110,fantasy
from beginning to end this a rollercoaster ridegreat visuals and action scenes,fantasy
lets face it mamoa is physical perfection you could roll 2 hrs of him and have a hit but is momoa and a lot more the underwater scenes as they explore the different kingdoms and seas are just awesome at times the movie reminded me of the bright neon colors from tron and avatar other times the creatures seemed to cross over from pacific rim the story was beautiful and the characters engaging i didnt think id like mira but she stole the screen on more than one occassion and could hold her own with momoas personality shes a fun cross between ariel and the black widow go see it buy the popcorn and enjoy the eye candy its worth every penny,fantasy
a movie where nicole kidman is a badass atlantian queen jason momoa is a badass rightful atlantian king and amber heard is a badass xebellian princessoh and its directed by james wan is a fun undersea romp of a movie nothing groundbreaking here but a solid addition to the dc universe as a fan of wonder woman and man of steel this is my third favorite movie of the franchise so farthe writing is lacking and this movie definitely is a paint by the numbers superhero movie but i really enjoyed the ride the visual effects the music and the acting are all top notchit is not a full set up of him becoming but it is a setup of him becoming king i really love jason momoa in this role and i hope we get to see more of him playing this character in the futurea nice enjoyable movie to ride out the new year worth seeing for a good time on a holiday afternoon,fantasy
jason momoa was superb he really made cool the storyline was decent predictable at times but the visuals are what made it worth it atlantis was more intricate than i could have imagined the underwater shots were cool it really felt like you were there with them i throughly enjoyed it,fantasy
first thing first let me tell you that i absolutely unabashedly love this movie this is the best film we ever had no question there sure there are some films that are good too nothing wrong with that but they were all you know not as good as this one this however is the opposite of that this movie makes every other film ive seen look like cheap school play but again im not saying that other films are bad theyre just pale in comparison to this new one jame wan is the master of his craft first he resurrected fast and furious and now he did the same thing for hes a true genius that deserves all the praise he gets a true mastermind a true filmmaker who understands what people want he made the best movie of the past decade and we true film fans should be thankful him for that the characters in here are the best in the series orm and the black manta are unarguably the most interesting multilayered characters in the universe heck i can say that they are one of the most interesting characters period all in all this movie is amazing on all accounts you should watch it and you should love it,fantasy
if you are movie lover u will sure fall in love with this movie stop checking for review dude go get a ticket now and start watching one hell of the treat,fantasy
this movie is the best movie after batman movies geat work dc,fantasy
just attended screening and man  what a ride it was the visuals storyvillains cinematography costumes sea creaturesetc everything is top notchamazing direction by james wan clearly shows how powerful he becomes in the endi am gonna watch it one more time do not listen to anyone or any critics who has an opposite opinion do yourself a favour and enjoy this gorgeous monster of a movie all hail the king theme song playing ,fantasy
i am trying to find words to praise this piece awesome level everything best of 2018,fantasy
really good movie a lot of similar moments to black panther but is much better definitely worth watching cgi is really good and the humour a little bit cringy but still really good jason mamoa did wellmy man ,fantasy
much better than venom and wasp  but story is very refreshing  a must watch movie for all superhero lovers amd especially dc fans,fantasy
unconventional but principle points for the movie 1 movie does a pretty good job with the origin story only that this movie takes place chronologically after the steppen wolf event in the justice league moviethe significance of this is that story gives the heros character tremendous boost after how he was portrayed in the justice league movie2 the story bestows you with different characters villains and groups of villains with just enough development time for each as required3 when into the movie for the most of the it the story is nothing that you havent seen before but it still feels new every time even though your anticipation might be met for many scenes in terms of the storyline4 the final act of the movie does an unbelievable job in singlehandedly lifting the alreadygoinggreat movie to new heights in terms of cinematography direction visuals and much more5 the movie doesnt hold back in showing you the amazing war visuals towards the climax which is only comparable with that of the lotr or avatar you may feel that even surpasses those movies in this aspect6 it is a whole new world underwater which has been meticulously created with immense diligence yes this is truly something which you might not have seen before7 most importantly the movie ends on a solid note followed by a lingering song from skylar grey that captures the essence of the entire movie,fantasy
after a long time well donevisual effectsreallymovingmovie is fantastic,fantasy
on of the best of this yearan another avatar under water,fantasy
its a big screen beauty james wan has created the underwater world beautifully amazing visuals amazing cast dont judge the movie based on critics reviews dc movies always takes the critics hit everyone gotta experience the movie,fantasy
great cast and this movie is a masterpiece  all together the experience was amazing,fantasy
 is the best dceu movie without a shadow of a doubt the cgi was phenomenal on the environment and the characters the whole cast of characters were so much fun  mera and manta were standouts for me orm and manta were great villains and definitely what the dceu needed to me this film is a 92,fantasy
dc comics has had a few and unfortunate setbacks when trying to make movies but this is not one of those stumbles the movie gives us a story based on one of the best comics of the character throne of atlantis and in this adaptation gives us a pretty solid story full of emotion that immerses us in a world not seen the film is an amalgam of perfectly well combined genres of moments is an action movie others is adventure science fiction and even romantic and horror director james wan undoubtedly knows very well how to get into the plot of a film contains a message of environmental awareness quite good but that could see was still better exploited even so james wan perfectly well leads the actors under his charge jason momoa we it gives a stunning and totally incredible that makes the jokes towards the character disappearamber heard is wonderful as mera who proves not to be a damsel in danger and rather a rough heroine yahya abdulmateen ii gives us a rather intimidating black manta and patrick wilson gives us an imposing ocean master also acts willem dafoe  dolph lundgreen and nicole kidman who do it quite well on the other hand the cgi effects are mostly impressive except for some moments that are too noticeable but the scenes in combat are sublime and the handling of the camera in those scenes is spectacular  the music of rupert gregsonwilliams is quite good and according to the scenes that keeps you entertained in conclusion is the best movie in the universe of dc well definitely it has bad things in it i do not deny it but in my opinion details that can be done aside if something makes clear is that when warner allows his directors to work on their stories something good comes out of it to my personal taste seemed infinitely superior to that seen in wonder woman which is highly recommended not to lose it,fantasy
this movie is even better than mcu storyline is classic but the cgi and graphics etc are so good that everybody must watch the movie in theatres jason momoas acting skills are very good and also be sure to watch the post creditshope the upcoming movies of dceu could be more of thisdirector james wan is best,fantasy
bu susi apakah termasuk jenis ikan dan dapat dimakan,fantasy
absolutely stunning film the effects of the underwater world are amazing this is now one of my favourite superhero films ever jason you are definitely king looking forward to seeing a directors cut of this film as i want to know more about the world of atlantis,fantasy
will keep the review short and straightforward to many would be the best dc has offered since the dark knight trilogy and watchmen the amount of action packed sequences in this movie is too much and everyone of them is done absolutely amazing  the vfxcgi is one of the best you can experience  you would definitely fall in love with the camera work that james wan has pulled off the script is also good  not great i missed the amazing dialogues and oneliners from zack snyder movies also the background scores were also not as per the scene the place where they should have put an epic score they put a pop music i know the taste to mucic is different for everyone  but still i thought it didnt fit right also sometimes the actors were doing some overthetop acting once you watch the movie you can see itthat been said the overall movie experience is just awesome you would definitely get the value of your money do experience it on imax,fantasy
the movie although has it moments in general was boring it felt like a hour longer from what it really last  the jokes didnt help a similar style of thor ragnarok and the dialogue was okay at beast maybe with another director and writers a secuel might be great the music was also just okay the actors cgi makeup etc where great,fantasy
plot holes so big that whole whales can swim through them but not even the worst dc movie which is bad but this movie is trash bad acting bad cgi and the story is horrible beyong the grave ,fantasy
heavy on exposition the movie keeps on giving flashbacks and all these annoying exposition on the history of atlantis without giving much depth to the characters the movie felt too long and was filled with typical movie clichs it tried to follow the narrative of thor and loki but just downright failed,fantasy
thought this would be a nice entertaining movie like wonder woman the first ten minutes were very promising but soon after it turns out to be a movie for teenagers or comic nerds which is fine but not exactly what i expected from the trailer the visuals were pretty but the story and the actors failed to make a connection with the audience the acting is very robotic and certainly not captivating it creates distance you dont feel with them unfortunatelythe fight scenes were nice to watch but not blown away dc can do better,fantasy
went into with an expected low bench mark and it certainly lived down to itbest parts are all with black manta and if they make a sequel with him as the villain theyve got my money againthe cgi swings wildly between incredible and something you would have seen 30 years agothe plot dialogue and acting is as wooden as an old treasure chest at timesits at least 50 minutes longer than it needed to be if theyd brought this in at 1hr 40 youd almost watch it again as a guilty pleasurebut they didnt so you wont410 still better than the predator,fantasy
i went to see the film with a friend today a bit afraid because of the damage that whedon did at the justice league turns out the film is fantastic the cinematography is amazing loved the underwater city and the characters were very well fleshed out even the bad guys were well written better than the last marvel films the last 56 years the jokes were on point and the women are no damsels in distress 1010,fantasy
 perfectly captures the inane hollywood bu5hit that ruins every good movie premise like all the dc classics could have been good if it was darker like batman and focused on character and story rather than special effects and cheesy one liners seriously one liners should have stopped after arnie did commando but here we are in 2018 with bikers taking selfies and stereotype bad guys in black with ridiculous weapons and the worst dressed underwater royalty ive seen the costumes in the little mermaid were betterprobably the worst movie i saw in 2018 and the last one,fantasy
as the six of us left the cinema after about an hour watching i saidto people i was disturbing  please excuse me  i am from a different planeti can watch the most fantastic of films fantasies can give you great pleasurefrom  its a wonderful life to space fantasies such as the start trek thevoyage home  where you could have empathy with spocks inter actionwith gracie the whale then there is the fantastic  galaxy questok i may not be the little boy who saw that the king was not wearingany clothes but what was i supposed to believe in and have empathywith here the goodies charging on sea horses and the baddies beingcarried by sharks do me a favourok i am in my seventies but my grandsons aged 14 13 who were sittingnext to me were the first to say lets go to be honest i had halffallen asleep it was only two of the folk on their phones in front of meand others munching popcorn which kept me awakei gave the one star for the scene in the aquarium when the young super hero isbeing bullied and the sharks come his rescue,fantasy
we first saw the popular dc comics character when he joined the team in justice league this was the first fulllength centred around him and the sixth entry in the dc extended universe which has been a mixed bag i hoped for some improvement directed by james wan saw insidious the conjuring basically in maine lighthouse keeper thomas tom curry temuera morrison rescues princess atlanna nicole kidman from the underwater nation of atlantis during a storm she stays on land they fall in love and have a son arthur kaan guldur and otis dhanji who is born with the power to communicate with marine lifeforms atlanna is forced to abandon her family and return to atlantis she gives her loyal advisor nuidis vulko willem dafoe the mission to train arthur with his guidance arthur becomes a skilled warrior but is rejected by the atlanteans for being a halfbreed and ultimately leaves atlantis behind one year after steppenwolfs invasion arthur jason momoa confronts a group of pirates attempting to hijack a nuclear submarine their leader jesse kane michael beach is trapped under rubble during the confrontation he forces his son david yahya abdulmateen ii to leave him behind to drown david vows revenge against arthur david later targets atlantis at the behest of king orm patrick wilson arthurs younger halfbrother and ruler of atlantis who plans to declare war on the surface king nereus of xebel dolph lundgren swears allegiance to orms cause but his daughter mera amber heard who is betrothed to orm refuses to aide them and journeys to the surface to ask arthur for help she earns his trust by saving thomas from a tidal wave sent by orm arthur reluctantly accompanies mera to a rendezvous with vulko he says if he can find the trident of atlan a magic artifact that once belonged to atlantis first ruler he will reclaim his rightful place as king they are ambushed by orms men and mera and vulko escape while arthur is captured orm visits arthur in captivity and tells him atlanna was executed for the crime of having a halfbreed son he blames arthur and the surface for her death orm offers arthur an opportunity to leave forever but arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava orm has the upper hand but arthur is rescued by mera together arthur and mera journey to the sahara desert to find information about the trident a holographic message found in a chamber beneath the desert leads them to sicily where they retrieve the tridents coordinates meanwhile orm provides david with atlantean armour and weaponry and sends him to stop them he imprisons vulko after learning of his betrayal and coerces the remaining kingdoms of atlantis to pledge allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface in sicily david now calling himself black manta ambushes arthur and mera and injures arthur before falling off a cliff to his apparent death mera nurses arthurs wounds as they journey to find the trident she encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero arriving at their destination arthur and mera are attacked by amphibious monsters known as the trench they manage to fend them off and enter a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the centre of the earth they arthur is shocked to be reunited with atlanna she was sacrificed to the trench for her crimes but she escaped them and reached the uncharted sea where she has been stranded ever since arthur must face mythical leviathan karathen dame julie andrews who guards the trident he voices his determination to protect both atlantis and the surface proves his worth and is able to reclaim the trident which grants him control over the seven seas arthur mera and atlanna lead an army of marine creatures in battle against orm and his followers it is after learning that arthur wields the trident and is the true king that the followers renounce their obedience to orm arthur defeats orm in combat but chooses to spare his halfbrothers life orm accepts his fate after seeing that arthur has found and rescued their mother atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with thomas while arthur ascends to the throne with mera by his side during the credits black manta is rescued by dr stephen shin randall park he agrees to take the scientist obsessed with finding atlantis to the underwater kingdom in exchange for his help in his revenge on arthur also starring ludi lin as captain murk graham mctavish as king atlan leigh whannell as cargo pilot john rhysdavies as the voice of the brine king and djimon hounsou as the voice of king ricou momoa does a great job as the charismatic atlantean prince who has a destiny heard is compelling as his sexy redhead sidekick wilson is rather stiff as the villain kidman is really likeable and lundgren does alright as well i will admit most of the dialogue is cheesy it is ridiculous at times and it is perhaps a little too long but the special effects going underwater and on land are brilliant and the fastpaced fight and explosive sequences are engaging it is fun to watch a worthwhile superhero action adventure good,fantasy
i have never been so driven to watch a movies exclusive screening but this ones a differenta spectacular delightthank you james wan,fantasy
let me preface this by saying that i am normally very forgiving of subpar movieshowever this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen in my life at this point i feel as if the world is playing a joke on me with the positive reviews ive been seeingi wouldnt say that i had high hopes of this movie being spectacular the moment i read about mamoa being cast a few years ago i was ecstatic he seems to be the perfect fit for however the concept of an movie seems kind of silly he talks to animals in the water sure but a movie just saying no high hopes just wanted a good timethe acting terrible character development none visual effects seems like a beginner if 1993 jurassic park could create effects like it did why was this so bad 15 years later directing awful so many shots were pointless and honestly dumb the script well lets just say there was a solid 10 minutes where the back and forth dialogue was comprised of 4 word sentences villains two half assed villains that dont really seem that awfulwhich is you know not great for a villian it seemed like there was an attempt made at a soundtrack and then just quit there were 3 heavy synth 80s songs and then pitbull for a bit what was that abouti dont even want to start on willem dafoes wig and costumethe plot seemed to grab aspects of other movies and threw them together trying to make something stick 3 points for every moment you recognize aladdin jurassic park indiana jones star wars power rangersi have never cringed as much or as consistently as i did during this movie i could honestly go on and on about every aspect of this movie that i found terrible but its doubtful that anyone will readtldr dc has to be deleting negative reviews the cast should be ashamed of this movie dont go see it,fantasy
the writing is sub par at bestthe cinematography is nauseatingthe cg is completely overusedthe characters have little to no developmentplease tell me how this is considered a good film the few bits that are interesting were those that featured black manta a character that i think is actually interesting and flawed in good ways in the comics however these were completely unessasery to the plot of the filmthis is the absolute worst dceu film that has been released even more then that id say its on par with green lanternone thing that really pissed me off were the jokes that dont land and dont make sense for the character or tone of this message of a film,fantasy
i cant believe all the high reviews of this movie what a terrible waste of 2 hours,fantasy
im shocked by all the high ratings this seems to have been given i thought it was absolutely terrible even the soundtrack didnt work why on earth nicole kidman would be associated with this trash i have no idea do yourself a favour and watch paint dry instead absolute shocker of a movie,fantasy
character portrayal is unsuccessful except for the villainsfirst time i fell asleep in the cinemai dont understand why the rating so highi realized why the opening early in chinamaybe its because chinese audiences are only looking for the spectacular special effectsif the film had been shown in same time both of china and the united states its rating would not have been as good as it is nowif 2 is opening early in chinai would not see it early,fantasy
not deep characters in action but not emotion or depth or angst or anything plain and fun i just missed something like loki depth or even thor had better lines it is colourful and big though,fantasy
horrible script computer game dramaturgy cliches galore unbelievable naive character building unconvincing cgi overkill just awful,fantasy
i cannot discribe how gash this is i am spoiling the film by letting anyone who hasnt see this film that its gash,fantasy
so disappointedhow can it still be rated more than 610dialogues are so cringeymanta suit looks like some power ranger villainpredictable plot4 or more scenes characters are talking then suddenly boom the doorwall gets blasted and in comes the villains,fantasy
jason was good kidman was miscasted no women of color in the entire movie and atlantis had no people of color whatsoever the only peoplelike beings were all white disappointing the only black people were the bad guys who were black pirates who really didnt need to be in the movie at all it really could have had a better storyline and diversity could have been better,fantasy
lets be fair was i bored no were the visuals interesting heck yes but unfortunately the dynamic action scenes in this were offset by the wooden dialogue unconvincing cgi cringeworthy melodramatic moments and virtually no character development overall this movie force fed me a choppy storyline that mirrored much of the style of michael bays tranformers series that is overstuffed with bombastic explosions but malnourished in actual substance i honestly believe that this should have been a show instead of a movie,fantasy
 lives underwater rocks the surface and its cool action and cgi but thats it,fantasy
blew away my expectations excellent visuals and good character development cant wait to watch it again,fantasy
this is absolutely perfectaction packedfunnyvisually astoundingleft me breathless my film of the yearsee it on the biggest screen you can,fantasy
a great movie good visual effects good acting good sound track i just love it ,fantasy
i dont know who writes these things i feel bad because i like the actors in this but jeez is this crap i got up out of the theater to just take a breath of fresh air this was so bad i only stayed because my ride was in moviefirst the main actor is not much with words so not sure why they make him do comedy the story you dont even understand especially the underwater people the one villain is just killed off with pretty good ease in middle of film the connection between main characters doesnt matchthis is just bad dc writing hire some marvel people please before doing another or at least make sure wonder woman is involved since shes the only decent movie to come from dc in a while,fantasy
im a fan of the genre but wonder woman continues to be a fluke i guess the movie wasnt the worst but i gave it a 1 star because by now you should know what willwont make a good superhero movie having a one dimensional villain with the mirrored powers of the hero is just lame in2018 imho oddly enough i know this is rated higher but i thought venom was a better movie because it did a batter job of staying fresher,fantasy
this movie sucks bad acting the background looks awefull omg,fantasy
aside from the stunning special effects the movie itself is quite cheesy,fantasy
can we please quit making character come backs this character discontinued why is he in front of me ahhh the plot awful i was waiting for ariel no more stupid hero moviesthis in no way shape or form means make another spiderman,fantasy
most boring fish movie of all timeeven goldfish would find this movie intolerable25 hours of ugly merman and mermaid swimming and running around,fantasy
the visual was great fight scenes looked good the actual dialogue was abysmal though awful every chance they got to go with a cheesy line they did the standard was set so high by marvel that i cant believe anyone thinks this movie was good,fantasy
not sure what other films people have seen to rate this as anything above 510 maybe this was their first trip to the cinemanot since one of the last transformers films have i slipped into a comatose state watching a filmit started off promising with a bit of humour then went into silliness giant red eyed ant head man and then into terminal boredom vast cgi battle scene  crabs vs sharks or somethingwonder woman was a masterpiece in comparison to thisit was good to dolph again and defoe was more wooden than pinocchio  we both guffawed out loud when he turned up,fantasy
notwithstanding being an absurd film the characters have little purpose are often unchallenged and everything seems to be oversimplified for the sake of having more stuff in the same filmdc apparently likes to take one step forward and two back with their films is unfunny when it attempts at humour its dull when it tries to be exciting and rather confusing in generali would particularly like to understand more about atlantis how does that work is it just a massive underwater authoritarian state with a mad misguided king why exactly is he so obsessed with waging war why do some people can breathe air are they two species why exactly is his fianc looking for actually why was mum on the surface in the first placethere are no answers here just a bunch of crazy ideas tossed at the viewer with the promise we will understand everything eventually and it never delivers those answers characters are shallow unmotivated and just kind of therecome to think of it is an absurd character anyway perhaps thats why no one made a film with him before if he is not surrounded by water and all the creatures living in it his only assets are being really strong and really resistant which are his only super powers in which case probably wonder woman and superman would be best suited to do whatever has to be done at least wonder woman can make people speak the truth and bounce bullets back what can do besides hit people with his trident and wrestle bad guys well the film doesnt telloh the cgi is good and there are some nice jokes and action sequences so i rate it 3 out of 10 i wouldnt bother paying to see it but it is worth a glimpse on the telly or some streaming service when its available if you like dc heroes that is,fantasy
it is a new big budget trash  starting with the fact that is arealy dumb character the movie neded to be a failure and it is the story is bad wreten and it gets so dull by the end that i wanted to leave the movie theater what a waste of time ,fantasy
at times the visuals are mesmerizing but then they are distracting or even too much they gave me headache at one pointother than that not a good movie boring plot with little character development or depth two villains that couldve easily been just one cheesy jokes 0 chemistry between the lead and the love interest in general youd expect much more from this movie with all the badass characters weve heard about in interviews and articles but you get none of that,fantasy
its the worst movie that i ve seensorry but this my opinion,fantasy
ve  1 good quality 3d2 very colorful3 some good fightaction4 some nice locationsve 1 very weak boring predictable and flat story2 no surprises or twists3 no emotional roller coaster ride flat line on emotional ecg d4 no character development5 things are happening too fast to give time to absorb or feel6 not connecting7 watch the trailer and you watch most of the movie,fantasy
i finally watched damn finally lucky for me i didnt read the review in here i expect nothing but to explore atlantis in the very 1st act when arthurs dad save his mom fron the sea i know exactly what gonna happen yeah basic thing they get married etcthe story is sort of predictable no brainer but you will be amazed on the fight scene the graphics extremely gorgeous and the sound score damn you really want this movie more the love story of dad and mom is very basic very generic but i cry bro thats what love isno color no religion no boundaries i have no complain about this movie theres bad jokes out there or very teen type sht but it didnt hurt the flow of the movies after all you will love this movie nevertheless i cry im amazed and i want more aqua man jasons movies he looks like steven adams thou its like watching nba and dc watched it bud,fantasy
the film was in sum incredible and breathtaking you will be entertained 95 guaranteememorable and emotional with an intricate plotthe action some of the very best rivaling any marvel movie to date jason momoa is a stud guysvisuals and sounds comparable to avatar if you have seen it the trench and karathentrident scenes alone are worth an oscar my goodness the soundtrack is addictive and amazing probably my favorite in the dcuacting was great and fitting especially patrick wilson jason momoa nicole kidman and willem dafoejames wan is simply a genius made black panther and antman look like bmovies in my honest opinion,fantasy
the story was messy the movie felt long because lack of good story the whole movie felt like a cartoon the only good thing about this move is the hot red hair girl,fantasy
i though the trailer was cheesy but it did not even hint at the utter cheesiness that pored upon me during the almost unbearable 150 minutes of this cg demo reel ive read many reviews complaining about terrible acting but i am sure it is not a lack of actors prowess they are all proven professionals i think this movie comes to show that if you dont have a story at all and if the dialogs are awkwardly stupid and the jokes are cringy even the best actors in the world cannot save the day for you please do not spend your money on this garbage because otherwise we will be drowning in endless sequels until the end of sentient life on earth and it wont be long,fantasy
throw a trident at my head for going to see this terrible terrible terrible the villains were quite dumb and underdeveloped how many times can they capture this guy throwing his hair back he sure cant act,fantasy
we saw last night and i was very disappointed i always loved as a kid and thought they could have gone a different direction that would have been great i like jason momoa as but the overall story didnt work for me i wont give away any spoilers but several times i found myself thinking this is all just silly,fantasy
this was a great movie everything that a good movie needs the cinematography was superb nicole kidman was awesome in her mother role and jason momoa was indeed yahya abdulmateen ii as black manta was a great pick all of the characters were strong and whether good or bad really pulled you into the movienot one dull moment,fantasy
a film that hopes for the audience that there is a hero of fish  water  god of water like a dream after hard work sleep from 10 oclock pm and woke up at 4 am in the morning,fantasy
great action great story not a slow moment a,fantasy
i really wanted to like this movie but it was just disappointing the action sequences and visuals are really well done but unfortunately theyre bogged down by incredibly weak writing ive liked jason momoa since game of thrones and was actually excited to hear he would be playing he has more than enough charm to play a great superhero lead see any chris from the marvel universe especially compared to the lackluster leads weve seen in the other dc films  not including gal gadot but momoa heard and dafoe are sorely underutilized the acting in really isnt great  but thats what you get when the actors are given boring flat dialoguethe movie never seems to stop unloading exposition at you and its crammed into every conversation you never get a chance to see the characters develop because everyone is too busy trying to explain the next worldbuilding element i mean i dont need 2 hours of exposition to understand a bunch of guys riding sharks shooting blasters at crab people give me the essentials and focus on making me care about the people im watching  let the world speak for itselfit really is a shame because almost everything else is great saving grace is its effects and set designs everything  except some questionable costumes  is extremely visually appealing and there is some wonderful imagery to be found but the thing is all of this beautiful shiny exterior is just serving as a means to distract you from a movie that refuses to even try to give you information in a creative way,fantasy
this movie was the thing that dc needed to end the year with really amazing movie had everything that it needed to have to make it a 1010 movie seriously you should watch it and see how amazing it is you keep getting chills and think its not going to get any better but it actually does in every scene,fantasy
it looks good great cgi colorful and fun to look at but thats all i really liked about itthe story was boring not funny the chemistry between characters was non existent the acting was pretty rubbish and the costumes were bad in placesthis basically drew no emotional response from me i didnt feel anything other than bored,fantasy
if i rank 3 best superhero films of all time it should be like1 the dark knight2 avengers infinity war3end of story,fantasy
is the savior for the dceu like people want it to be well i would lean towards saying no but its far from the disaster some may have expected james wan not only brings a new flavor to the universe but makes a separate entry into a series that desperately needed itthere are two mindsets at play here one being that wan clearly meant to make a overly dramatic and bombastic adventure with cheesy dialogue the other that the film is a tonal mess that at times takes itself far too serious and at other times almost having too much fun i fall somewhere in the middle i can acknowledge that a film that has a massive octopus playing the drums under water has a certain sense of self awareness but theres no doubt in my mind that the mixture of tones just doesnt work in some momentsjason momoa is the perfectarthur curry and im mad that i had any doubt over his casting all those years ago despite not having the best chemistry romantically his love interest mera amber heard plays well off of him when they arent making out in the midst of an all out under water war they share some of the best action scenes of the film including a rooftop chase that displays the true genius behind wans framingcamera worki could have completely done without black manta as it felt very much like the unnecessary presence of baron mordo in doctor strange also his costume is absolutely absurd and i dont care how close it is to the comic book iteration of manta the other villain patrick wilsons oceanmaster is an overcooked  cliched power hungry super villain that did next to nothing for me theres a good antagonist in there somewhere for but it sure wasnt in this origin storyid be remiss not to mention nicole kidman considering how great of a year she is having and her turn as atlanna is no different owning her action sequences and elevating all of her dialogue kidman is likely the most memorable thing from the film and i hope to see more of her character at some point or anotherextravagant colorful bombastic a tonal mess and cheesy is right around where i expected it would be and hopefully the beginning of a new era of dc movies heres hoping7510,fantasy
dolph lundgren sets the bar low and everyone else follows in this awful high budget b movie in fact you would expect dolph to be way out of his depth here in the company of such talent as nicole kidman willem dafoe and patrick wilson but no the dialogue and storyline are so bad that the skill required to act in this movie brings every down to dolphs level i felt embarrassed for the actors forcing their way through cheesy lines and sat cringing as joke after joke fell flat i give it 2 stars because the cgi guysgirls actually do a fantastic job its just a pity theres no substance to the rest of the movie,fantasy
i read the previous reviews and thought this must be really good in fact the reviews for holmes and watson were so bad that i decided to watch insteadthis movie was so bad i began laughing at the end like a satire instead of an action movie also to much random stuff and weird relationship attempts never never watch this movie call me ocean master,fantasy
seriously if not for some good visual effects this was a highbudget birdemicim not sure which was worse the five minute stretches of exposition that were supposed to take the place of character development or the facepalm  cringeworthy dialogue there were times in the film that was so bad i literally had to stifle laughter so i wouldnt ruin the movie for the people that were actually enjoying iti had high hopes after seeing how good wonder woman was and id heard good things about it ahead of timethis is the kind of movie the people are going to look back on and realize it was even worse than they thought when they first saw it,fantasy
marvel x dc is the rivalry of this century clearly though marvel has always taken a lot of advantage in this confrontation simply because their adaptations are better better done and especially have infinitely better scriptsits amazing that at a time when technology is so advanced as to create amazing scenarios and great underwater scenes perhaps what does best dc can not get someone decent to write a story that is minimal enough evoke freudian problems with father or mother and embarrassing situations the scripts are the greatest achilles heel of dc productions if batman vs superman 2016 had that embarrassing scene of the two heroes resolving a fight just because they discovered that they had the same name of the mother in we were presented to the monster alone and with depression alone and isolated from the world in the depths of the endless sea karathen warmed his heart just because arthur jason momoa talked to himohh you talked to me how beautiful in a thousand years no one has ever done that can take the trident for youthis is just an example of how is flopped although it had great potentialoverall the tacky aesthetics established by zack snyder also tired and lets face it never worked very well in the dc film series the best works in this sense were precisely the 300 2006 and the watchmen 2009 perhaps one of the best films based on comicsjoining this to the moments worthy of a cinema that is not practiced more  what was that kiss of the in the princess meira amber heard in the middle of the war  there is very little left to praise about the filmbut lets try a few moments for example the underwater scenes are actually very good and well made the special effects idem the whole fight in sicily is also a high point all the aesthetics and design of atlantis a civilization extremely advanced in relation to the human have also been very well made although sometimes atlantis looks like a scrap of avatar 2009 with carbono alterado 2018 on the other hand it is too tiring quest for such a magic trident was it even necessary to show in detail and with generous time all the peoples of the seven seas if they were more restrained it would save at least half an hour of film and there was still the parallel plot of the manta yahia abdulmateen ii a surface villain who gave a hook for a second moviespeaking of villains king orm patrick wilson is an embarrassment that only dc gives us he has tantrums because he has a halfblooded halfbrother wants to start a war with the surface based on a supposedly nasty assault in addition to becoming the lord of the oceans what ambitions are orm wanting to start a war with the surface want to be the lord of the planet after all you can not believe that men are polluting the planet and you have to act before its too late and all part of an anger of the half brother whom he blames for the death of his mother in short everything very badly countedspeaking of the relationship of atlanna nicole kidman with her children another dc problem arises lack of care with what we call transmedia storytelling this is another moment in which marvel is giving a bath in the rival during the film princess meira quotes that the needs to reclaim the throne or the brother will initiate a war and it recalls its importance in defeating stepenwolf thus implying that the film follows the events of the justice league so far so good the problem is that in arthur says that he never treads on atlantis because of what the people did to his mother only that of stepped there in justice league to speak and fight steppenwolfin addition in it is clear the love and devotion of arthur for the mother since always the problem is that in justice league he speaks of atlanna with rancor as if he had been abandoned your queen left me at the door of my fathers house but in it is shown that both had a coexistence in arthurs childhood and the clear love between them in addition to the devotion that has lasted forever that is the dc multiverse has holes and contradictions and it is not tied tightly and this is further evidenced by the lack of planning for the next stepsjames wan did not deliver the to his full potential but jason momoa looked very well in the lead role it looked like it was the right choice though the alpha male bombed look was very different from the originalbut dc still owes a string of great movies in its new phase the only one that deserves all the praise remains wonder woman 2009,fantasy
the cinematography and the cgi is the best ive seen mind blowing stuff the acting and the fight scenes were also fantastic however i disliked the music choices for certain scenes but i get that they were trying to make a fun film not a dark one the acting was decent this and wonder woman are very good,fantasy
its a super hero film as it should be lots of action and cgi is greataimed more at kids so your 12 year old will love itzach snyder should take some tips from james wan,fantasy
it delivers a solid a performance not only visually but the story is very rich the acting is and fight scenes are legendary this epic tale is for sure the best standalone superhero movie of the year it balances the dark and the light with a real feel to how people would act under these circumstances james wan makes great movies with each new dc film they get better and better why would you let the media decide what you watch you dont let your parents tell you do you psssst the negative reviews are paid for by disney cough cough,fantasy
so so sooooo good the fight scenes the story the pace literally better than every single marvel movie,fantasy
best film in 2018 actors are well suited for each character,fantasy
this movie is amazing because it contains a beautiful visual effects that ive ever seen and the plot is so good but also the fight scenes are epic,fantasy
can express how good it was i never expected that dc would give such a nice storyline and vfx was too goodmust give 1010,fantasy
this movie is the best from dc comics you should definitely watch it jason momoa has played the role brilliantly the whole cast is entertaining i loved this movie,fantasy
i was hoping this movie was going to be a good watch and be competitive against a marvel film but it just isntpositives first  finally a dc film that isnt so dark lot more light hearted and at some points fairly funny some of the cgi is amazingnegatives  where to start the cringe one liners felt like a 70s bond moviei know its based in atlantas but some people ride sharks and other ride weird sea horses lol just doesnt workmakers seemed to have used cgi on everything even when you could use real people or vehicles whymarvel has nothing to worry about comparing this to there films try again dc,fantasy
im not a big dc fan but that doesnt stop me from wanting to watch the movies when man of steel came out i was okay with how it turned out then the movies that followed in suit were a complete disaster wonder woman turned out good and lifted the spirits in all of us however we need more than just wonder woman to save this franchise is the movie that gives the franchise a fresh new take and the turning point that these mucky waters surely need is the best dc movie in my opinion after watching this masterpiece i can say that without a doubt that warner bros is on the right track i can only hope that they decide to make more movies like this is the turning point that dc needs the tides are changing and from the looks of it they are changing for the better,fantasy
 as a movie is the best and the most surprise ive got from the dceu till now when it managed to turn a quite bland character in the justice league movie and a joke character that never meant to be taken seriously according to many dc comic fan that i read online into this one large tatted up man with a larger than life personality who embodiment all the things that kids love when they watch a superhero movie the movie is part traditional superhero movie part horror movie part kaiju movie all wrapped up neatly into one thank to director james wan risking his career out there when he decided to direct a movie about a not many people know superhero that unlike the already established superman or batman just like james gunn with his guardians of the galaxy series and director zack snyder for choosing jason momoa to be the live action version for the dceu,fantasy
movie was just fantastic action was epic underwater world was stunning and great well done dc i can say that soon they will match marvel movies james wan did great job i hope he will continue work with dc movies in future,fantasy
best comic movie ever made im gonna watch it again and again,fantasy
i have not seen a movie like this before graphics n vfx are damn goodmamoa is perfect and rocks it will be a blockbuster the story is average but the experience is off the charts will recommend,fantasy
one of the awesome comic book movies of all time very unique tone and is really good already a hit in india loved the movie and mamoacasting and vfx are awesome,fantasy
the we are now faced with is a far better character than previously portrayedin the mediathis movie continues to have arthur as the reluctant leader of atlantisi was thoroughly surprised at how much i enjoyed itthe wife enjoyed seeing jason with his kit off so win win i guess maybe a gym membership is required,fantasy
 is such a stupid and hilarious character im glad they didnt make this a serious movie and just made it into pretty much an episode of dbz,fantasy
do not listen to anyone who says negative about this film see you with your own eyes i am really happy and satisfied  i personly found story and costumes and cgi are so beuatifully done world of atlantis is beyond mijn expectation jason momoa is super good  and i am going tonsee it again,fantasy
story  averagemusic  goodacting  goodall other  aaaaawwwwwsssssoooommmme,fantasy
after so many fails teen titans batman vs superman justice league dc took a step forward the right direction its true i saw many iconic marvel things like small funny plot twists or the idiot superhero but still it was better than so many marvel movies  i am not making a marvel vs dc i love superhero movies no matter the studio anyway lets go straight to the point the sfx are amazing the plot is surprisingly good the villains actually had character and a reason everyone gave their best and actually sent some emotions i am looking forward for more dc movies like this one910  would watch it again for sure,fantasy
i always thought that the problem with dceu was the overhandling from the wb executives and the conflict with the dceu mastermind himself but today james wan came with a fresh new strategy bringing a whole new experience of dceu the one we all deservesince ww i can say that this movie is the hope sprouting for us fans for all the upcoming dceu movies sure its not that great there are still many rough scenes but there are exactly nothing i can complaint this only makes me expect many great things from dceu,fantasy
there must be something wrong with their minds dceu copycats childish plots unexplained scientific phenomena wellwhy you guys never criticized marvel on these stuffs marvel copied dc firstmarvel are pretty good at creating childish and meaningless plotsmarvel invented a plenty of supernatural and ridiculous stuffs besidesmovies published by disney or the other companies subordinated by disney nearly got no pretty harsh comments made by critics on metascore you may sayohvenoms an exception sorryits copyright still belongs to sony instead of disney d wanna characters related to spiderman back to complete mcuprobably its the one that ordered critics to make terrible comments on venom so it could find a good and proper reason to take that back its not a coincidence its a part of disneys horrible plans that sounds like kinda conspiracy theorybut the facts exist there do not be fooled by darth mickeynever,fantasy
only after watching did i realize how hard it was for the director and his team to make a movie with a dc character most of them are godly which makes it hard to develop them into believable and relatable characters yet all dc origin movies succeeds in this aspect movie is the best way anyone could portray his origin story and keep the viewers engaged at the same timedc has the best story arcs in comics if the initial movies succeed then we will get to view all those wonderful stories come to life on big screen,fantasy
good move i loved it but somthing dumb with it that is almost every scene starts or escalate with an explosion plus its little bet long,fantasy
i never expected dc movies to be this thrilling and breathtaking i mean the action scenes is spectacular and the cast are allll gorgeous as hell i really enjoy the movie so much really recommended,fantasy
had a fun time watching it in 3d the vfx were good and the screenplay was crisp the dcmu have upped the ante with this one jason mamoa my man watch it in imax 3d if you can,fantasy
its totally different movie and its epic fabulous and a complete movie with drama emotion humour action fantasy adventure wat else you need one top critic in rotten tomatoes said that too much water idiot its underwater movie and name itself then wat u expect,fantasy
plot holes timeline inconsistencies rip offs of other movie plotlines and scene scapesi wanted to like this movie and had high hopes especially after wonder womanvisually its spectacular but its a messbarely an original idea involved,fantasy
it is the movie that i most waited this year and the truth i was surprised and exceeded all my expectations jason momoa was born to play his performance is excellent the love that has this character amber heard was wonderful and her performance excellentspecial effects soundtrack unique and epic costumes 3d surprised me i was so fascinated by the visual quality of this film all the scenes of the action are good and the final epic battle james wan as a director unique and his great work was noticed it is a film made to surprise excite and love this movie it is one of the best of the dceu and an incredible surprise the best movie of the year,fantasy
 is an ultimate mixture of action emotion and whopping visuals vfx was eyepleasing camera angles were excellent 3d effects was soo good james wan took the story to the next level by his direction stunts were done perfectly dc dynastys best film after a wonder women this will be a blockbuster for sure james wan has proved another time that he is capable of directing any genre of the movie hats off to him and his crewto leave my review spoiler free i mustnt talk anything about the storyone word must watch the film your money wont get wasted it worth every penny,fantasy
man what a visual treatone of the best use of cgi till date watch it at the biggest screen you can find,fantasy
dc films comes in with a tidal wave sized splash with things are still rocky in terms of the dceu however marvel still has competition for solo outings and is that strong contender that was neededjames wan takes the metaphorical throne for this one and this movie has his finger prints all over it i am such a fan of his work the movies story played out so well and the camera shots from the way the angles are used to the panning around action scenes when they choose to spiral around or stay steady the cgi i might add is amazing there is no mountain of mustache mayhem to be found here the colors are so vibrant and unique but blend together to create truly magical scenerythis movie makes quick mention of arthurs involvement in justice league but is barely attached to the previous batch of dc films we are treated to the origin of via short flashback moments that tie in with the present day plot that give you a deep connection to our underwater hero its very similar to the first season of cws arrow but only in the sense of two stories intertwining to support the overall storyarch but doesnt keep going back to the past for the entire duration of the filmthis movie has action every where you look but also tells a great impactful tale of a loner more or less needing convincing to go from rags to riches in order to save not only atlantis but earth from arthurs younger brother king orm who plans on uniting the kingdoms of the sea and taking a battle to us surface dwellers for the murders and poisonings of the oceans creaturesnot a single character felt insignificant or out of place and absolutely everything that was done had tremendous purpose each actor brought their characters out of the water and into life where you could truly feel connection to everyone jason momoa really turns the charisma on and keeps the wit and charm showed off in justice league and became a completely lovable leading man and amber heard is right up there with him in a constant back and forth battle for leading standout of the film both deliver perhaps their own respective performances of their careers and heard fully keeps mera as a strong willed bad ass and momoa oozes machismo as the film continues on i could go on for days and describe the outstanding performances of patrick wilson nicole kidman dolph lungren willem dafoe and yahya abdulmateen ii but just trust me and see for yourselves how great they arei truly feel that this is a knock out of the ballpark for dc  wb if you like giant battle scenes swords or in this case trident  fight scenes or just bad ass combat this ones for you,fantasy
its is visually stunning and entertaining go see it,fantasy
its popcorn movie you laugh few times jason looks great the cg are pretty cool and the story is ok but nothing moreps the part nicole k is jason mom is like crazy,fantasy
i watched it on imax in cancun mexico its the most spectacular movie ive ever seen the reviews are mostly positivebut dont listen to anyone who gives it a negative review most of the negative reviews are coming from the uk seems highly suspicious because this movie is great period your eyes will be glued to the screen to try to notice all the visual details its funny and momoa is awesome the camerawork is topnotch and the action sequences are crazy,fantasy
its one of the best movies ever made and this movie resurrected again,fantasy
but i can say this movie change my mind and dcs universe i love it so much,fantasy
really had not enjoyed any dc movie as much as this after batman series nolanmovie is great awesome gfx specially the underwater scenesmade me remember a game called submarine titans while i was a kid lolmovie is bang on should earn 500700m in box office collections,fantasy
this movie was really enjoyable from beginning to end action was insane it has same level of action as avengers infinity war maybe more this movie felt really big for a solo film visuals and cgi are simply the best ive seen in a while perfect use of comedy they didnt insert a funny scene in between a serious moment loved the music the use of music was very different than other superhero movies all characters are lovable even dad who didnt had much screentime james wan gave his horror touch in this movie as well which was awesome atlantis is much more than shown in the trailers 3d effects and camera movement are so good that youll feel like youre actually in a ship taking a tour of atlantis many questions that people had like why black mantas helmet is so big have been explained in movie overall the movie is so good that im going to watch it again,fantasy
this is one of the best action movies i have seen see it it has a great story line it also has great acting it is kind of scary at times it a great movie justice league is a good movie and this is better,fantasy
boring bad cgi just bad thrown together dc movie making style,fantasy
i dont like this movie like other from dc love dark king and other two films because you cant understand how do it works they are just a people how do they fly in the water like a cryptons,fantasy
went to see the movie in 3d imax and i still could not sit all the way through it jason moma needed an actual script to work with because he was terrific in game of thrones dc still can not meet the same level as marvel in story telling their characters are just not interesting except wonder woman,fantasy
its like three movies in one i didnt care if the hero succeeded or not it felt like gungan city most of the time there wasnt any chemistry between the actors i was thoroughly disappointed with this film,fantasy
it looks as though dceu just wont learn from their mistakes like batman vs superman the movie fails to grip the viewer in almost any waycharacters are not developed and an over reliance on cgi makes one feel detached from the film and omg  the backing sound in a word is awful i defy anyone to like the electronic tune that accompanies some key scenesi think the dceu powers have to sit down and watch all the marvel films of late so as to see how they are a very distant 2nd to any of them,fantasy
cant believe there are movies like this still being made in 2018 biggest mistake,fantasy
thats it is clich and boringi dont understand why people love this movie its really badthe soundtrack is very repetitive and the story is very linear and because is such a linear movie becomes really boring romance feels forced and flat,fantasy
i cant believe this got this high of a rating this is the worst superhero film since the edward norton hulk pretty bad visually it was entertaining i guess,fantasy
well jason momoa looks amazing but the plot of the movie was terrible this is not even looking at the inaccuracies of this movie first off black manta and his father are pirates that already obtain high tech equipment and then it is found out that aqua mans half brother orm paid them to do so if he is also a powerful why did he not do it himself and just become king anyways later black manta basically becomes ironman making his own suit without any scientific background which makes no sense the water holograms seemed unnecessary as well also they are many lights seen underwater in atlantis which if you are in that depth of water where is this light coming from another side note would be how the color red is not visible at a depth further than 5 meters so how is meras hair so red underwater there are also random monsters thrown in and it seemed like there was no reasoning behind it i love james waan but this movie was a major disappointment you cant just throw action scenes together and expect a great movie dc movies are not even worth seeing anymore,fantasy
while i can tell that an effort was made to make this movie good still reeks of untapped potential completely goofy and dumb moments and all the cheese youve come to expect from the dceu i went in open minded as i had heard good things about this movie i left pretty disappointed and even kinda baffled they thought this was enough to redeem the cinematic universe it isntwell start with the cons and then work our way to the pros if a movie has more pros than cons i start with those first but more cons than pros i go with cons first theres a lot to wade through so bear with me horrific overcompensation of the character of with powers as lame on paper as can breathe underwater and can talk to fish they tried making him an utterly unstoppable beast with as many muscles as possible he can chug a whole glass in a second he doesnt even flinch at bullets he can bend steel am i describing or a mad science experiment with a heavy emphasis on drinking the dude is completely invincible except for when the script needs him to be weak like when hes fighting his brother in the first act and gets his butt handed to him awful effects i swear half the sea creatures are missing frames of animation anything that was designed for the movie looks just plain ugly for a movie mostly set underwater you would think it would be more magical than what im seeing here seeing characters float around and interact with each other underwater also comes with an awful microphone effect i get its underwater but it sounds broken also really bad greenscreen it sticks out a lot and you can tell at all times boring as hell people sitting near me were taking naps and not missing anything interspersed with the action and effects are at minimum 20 minute scenes consisting of underwater politics and talking with his red haired lady friend nothing is achieved with these scenes sometimes its plot relevant but most of the time it really isnt baaaaaaaad soundtrack whoever gave pitbull and rhea the green light to ruin africa by toto should be thrown into the trench with mom then we should throw pitbull in there too the rest is that mystical wow look at this scenery music thrown in with synth ripped straight from thor ragnarok and other bland music similar to pitbull seriously no one likes pitbull hes a joke in the music industry and he shouldnt be allowed near movies ever speaking of ragnarok this movie is trying really really hard to be ragnarok a strong man who thinks hes got it all has to learn how to be a leader after being exiled by a relative bent on conquering all that is wow thats the same exact plot description as ragnarok on top of the half synth soundtrack and reliance on cg i just felt like i was watching and forgive me for this a watered down ragnarok the twists and turns this movie goes through dont add up to much and you can see them coming from the horizon when the action works it works when it doesnt it really doesnt stop getting fancy with the camera the first two action scenes are great they dont move the camera much hell the first one is a onetake oceanmaster vs in the first act was awful theres this moment where the camera zooms out to them being little specks on a statue and you can barely see whats going on i dont care about the statue i care about the two men with pointy sticks is it because theyre fighting over something bigger than themselves just keep the action on them their actions speak much louder symbolically than the statue black manta vs was also lame oceanic warfare in the third act was just baffling and the rematch at the end was also lame why is it so inconsistent you had it right the first time costume design was just plain goofy the suit looks super dumb the oceanmaster suit looks like lego black mantas suit looks simply idiotic in broad daylight and of course thats the only time they use it atlanticops the police people in the red and white suits from atlantis all look stupid positives now like i said the first two action scenes are great one takes will always make me happy in any movie and one take action scenes are very impressive the second scene where is taking out the pirates is also great even though its just more compensation the sound design and close quarters action makes this look and feel brutal black manta as a character is great easily the best thing about the movie its dumb that the first thing he does with atlantis technology is vandalize it but other than that hes awesome reminds me a lot of killmonger who was also one of the better things about the movie he was in im happy that isnt just given all the strength in the world right away hes really strong but he still has room to grow and needs to learn new things to get an edge on people that have been waiting for this moment for years and years i think thats ittldr this movie is bad and isnt worth your time dceu has done nothing but disappoint for what 5 movies now of course they wont die weve been saying dcs goose is cooked since suicide squad and nothing has changed so just keep away and let the tide pull this one out to sea,fantasy
it was many and many a year agoin a kingdom by the sea     edgar allen poes annabel leewhile the women in the audience for characterarthur can ogle jason momoas fit pecs the men can enjoy the young amber heard s beauty as princess mera and for a bonus that of the nicelyputtogether nicole kidman as the matriarch atlanna and thats all there is folks at least for adults for 8yearold boys explosions and fights excitingly occupy almost all the filmarthurs reluctant struggle to find the magic trident think a sword in a stone and claim his right to be king of atlantis follows the usual mythical arc which includes fighting the evil brother king orm patrick wilson and finding the trident like the legendary king arthur this arthur must wrest the trident from a monster not a stone otherwise director james wan can cut back to the lighthouse and arthurs real father temuera a fit tom curry who waits patiently for the return from the sea of his mermaid wife atlannausually some relief can be had in the cgi setting under water but here the scenes are so dense with creatures and ruins and yes explosions that you cant digest it all and may end up not appreciating any nor can you possibly give a pass for willem dafoe the true actor with kidman in the whole lot because i just saw dafoe play a memorable vincent van gogh in edge of eternity i am miffed that he would play the kings vizier with one line worthy of his acting ability and not any anotherjason momoa formerly of a conan remake is a physicallyappealing choice for previous iterations have him blonde blueeyed and thor like rather than the more interesting smokyeyed longtressed surferbiker dude here beyond the physical attributes momoa is given nexttonone smart lines or anything to help develop his characteroh well 8year old boys win this round yet a fetching kidman can be its own reward for us caregivers,fantasy
i honestly cant believe how many good reviews this is getting in quite a few parts the supporting cast were really bad actorsactresses the only thing that saved them was sense of humor when i heard that the budget was lower than other comparable superhero movies it made sense disappointing,fantasy
i thought this had great visual effects and while the plot has holes in it amber heard is by far the hottest redhead out there good acting and damn she looked good,fantasy
this ride takes u to another worldhats off to the director nd the 3d nd vfx team which takes us to a world beyond our imaginationits undoubtly the best movie i have watched till date,fantasy
dc universe films really are baaaaad yet this sadly is one of their best efforts not the worst starts but quickly descends into farce the entire dc studio folk need to hire a new cgi company too especially as their films are so cgidependentthe fight scene midway through with the pirates son i cant recall his stupid villain name and by the time we get to this scene i gave up caring about any character is something you would see in a power rangers episode laughablei expected a terrible film based on the previous dc universe garbage and yet it still disappointed,fantasy
this seemingly unscripted deep space movie set underwater has no home in any universe after dcu reboots the disaster created by sir snyderwhy the futuristic weapons and vehicles why does aqua man stand at random times to fight underwater why dont they kick water to tread water like their seafish counterparts seen doing that exact thing in the same scenesthen you randomly rejoin mankind as if they ran out of money for transition scenesquestion does the red head hit up her neighborhood salon to dye her hair crayon yellow like cartoon disney merpeople,fantasy
exremely cheesy movie cheesy story chees character motivatios partiatly cheesy fight scenes absolytely redicoulus ant looking villian outfit but still can be watched once bacause of the great visuals and cool locations overall dissapointing though,fantasy
super cheesey story and momoa was so stiff and awkward his acting felt so forced and uncomfortable to watch too bad i was really looking forward to this movie besides wonder woman,fantasy
ive been a fan of since the 60s so ill take my own counsel about this film over anyone who was not even born at the time i was originally reading comics if you never read these comics as a child if you never collected them if you never watched the superman hour of adventure cartoon show from the late 60s every saturday morning with your brother then you aint qualified to review it really if you have if you have taken the time do you find reprints and trade paperbacks of the old stories well then thats good a person should try to be at least a little bit familiar with the character before watching this and if you dont have the money to buy a bunch of used comic books then there is wikipedia and other online sources that are pretty good that can fill you in with the uniqueness of this character because once you understand the character you will see why i highly appreciate this filmeven though i stopped actively collecting in the 70s i still kept up with the history of the character was originally a blonde haired blue eyed seawater breathing seahorse riding gent who could talk to fish and swim around in the deep but not much else he was the king of atlantis and so his comic books always dealt with his administration of the underwater kingdom while his adventures with the justice league of america sometimes took him to other planets hes saved superman more than once and at one time he grew his hair out long and lost one of his hands replacing it with a hook he became a much darker more unkempt and disheveled figure much like frank millers the dark knight version of batman which in my opinion ben affleck was the greatest depiction of this is the undersea super powered version of the dark knight and jason momoa who became famous playing ronon dex in stargate atlantis another fable which included atlantis has been the first and best version of i dont think anyone can take it from herei really dont know the state of the dc cinematic universe at this time zack snyder started it with his man of steel which lead up to the creation of the justice league and it is sad very sad that this story is not continuing or is it i think i see plans for ii and justice league ii but other new films are planned which are basically reboots of what zack snyder created i dont want that i want to see a second justice league movie which includes the characters as they are now is one of the latest films to be told in the dccu and it caps off the tale with a threat that grows from the deep arthur curry has a halfbrother played by patrick wilson nite owl from watchmen and i admit he is very handsome as an atlantean who wants to be crowned ocean master which will empower him to make war upon the surface arthur has to prevent this somehow and his adventures take him to atlantis the sahara my homeland sicily and finally the marianas trenchchallenger deep  to meet a unique creature that has killed everyone who has ever come face to face with it can arthur survive thisnow the one thing about this film is that there appears to be a huge knock down drag out fight every 5 minutes but they are well choreographed i thought the atlanteans had too many gizmos those are my only complaintsi thought it was cool that nicole kidman is his mom while bobba fetts clonepop is his dad and his gf mera amber heard hm she was married to capn jack sparrow so its an all in the family affairmainly i loved that a character that i loved as a child has finally been given their own film and a guy i like played him thats all anyone can asknotice  since this review is pretty much the same as the other review that somehow got posted before this one im removing spoilers because i did not really put any spoilers in here this was the update to that review and it just has a few new things in it,fantasy
i was getting tired of comic book hero movies until i watched this well worth giving it a go,fantasy
 what can i say its ok if you have nothing else to watchas i sat and watched the movie i seriously expected to say im son of odin king of asgardthen i kept expecting thor to appear somewherei thought when youre watching a movie it would have its own characters i dont think one is supposed to think of another character in another movie maybe im wrongi cant believe james wan chose to direct and not the nun that all his fans were looking forward tosince he didnt direct the nun it was a horrible piece of crap to try and savethe nun couldve been so much better but it tankedwhen a horror movie can make me fall asleep its an epic faili digress i hope next time james wan chooses wiselyi gave it a 4 for some entertainment value,fantasy
 is living proof that a dc film can actually be great let alone good with great acting great visuals and insanely amazing cinematography is a beautiful film i could watch over and over again the movie is the definition of a guilty pleasure all the actors and actresses are great the score is something to take note of as it really brings you into the movie and is really definitive and well done in the end is a great and beautiful movie thats a blast to watch 455 93,fantasy
if you like cheese this movie is for you the action is okay but these actors can do better than the poorly written dialogue,fantasy
is dc getting their mojo back did they lose it or was it just the overall power of marvel that just seemed to squash dc with james wan at the helm who got famous with being one of the minds behind the saw franchise one of the most important ones that is there is experience at the helm and he really brings a lot of humor into it  like the bar scene which goes against what people would expect from thatbut for every scene like that you also have a scene with one of the movies villains who is so over the top you would suspect him to be comical no pun intended but he is dead serious shame for missing out on something that could have been really great jason momoa on the other hand is having a lot of fun and all the cast is having a lot of fun maybe even the crazy villain in between takes definitely not on camera a lof women and some men will love this regardless of story just being visually attracted to it and that is ok for everyone else you can have fun with this if you dont overthink it,fantasy
the 71 imdb score was enough for this comic book movie fan to say ill give that a try do not let these ratings fool you worst film of all the recent dc universe and thats saying something and possibly the worst mainstream movie ive ever seen terrible dialog acting plot and soundtrack yes the visuals are impressive but that doesnt make up for the fact that youre looking at every cheap one liner and movie cliche known to man being jammed into the movie like a 1 year old trying to fit a baby carrot into and electrical outletfor your own good save your time and watch something literally anything else,fantasy
a massive dumping ground of ideas good and bad and for that the movie suffers from an uneven script and tone yet another mediocre villain mediocre performances and even more eyebleedingly bad cgi courtesy of the dceu510,fantasy
all those people basking here about being worst than expected and how it achieved 1 billion answer is simple the same way black panther didand also throne of atlantis is the first original story,fantasy
please there must be 2 please i enjoyed it a lot wow wow wow,fantasy
i fell asleep bad acting bad story could have been so much better,fantasy
dumbing down fantasy created 70 years ago when science crude compared to today for young adults was poor at best a time when ancient myths such as atlantis held sway in peoples imaginations atlantis a city whumans living at the bottom of the ocean never mind pressures  its effects at different depths and even how cities could be constructed how human atlanteans could breathe wout gills or any other mode of o2 absorption how they could talk at any depth  in perfect english try talking under water and see how h2o density makes speech unintelligible how there could be a paradise of trees  waterfalls at the earths core forget pressure thousands of degrees heat molten ironusual script hooks of bullying of young lots of lasers  martial arts kicks also found in recently released bumblebee lots of strength displays like lifting a submarine out of the water but oddly it takes more effort to just toss a human about lots of stereotyping of characters  formula good n bad our underwater humans say they have the greatest military on the planet yet theyre riding around on giant seahorses  sharks the one positive to the movie was the justification for war against the surface because our plastic pollution millions of tons per year is destroying their habitat appropriately we get a real scene with hills of plastic garbage being thrown back at us,fantasy
i have never felt so much watching a movie i was so frustrated and angry i thought it was such trash then when they played pitbull i couldnt stop laughing the rest of the movie became me laughing at it and getting out all my frustration yelling at a movie was never so cathartic it is truly trash and i loved it,fantasy
bad directing and bad script make this 2 and a half hour cliche feat unbearable shameful,fantasy
i liked green lantern better well not really but i cant think of a suckier movie than this my 9 year old was laughing and critical in alternating waves id almost rather watch wwe well not really but i cant think of anything cheesier,fantasy
i love superhero movies if they are done well the hype that was built up for this film really got me excited i thought that was going to be absolutely amazing the commercials made it seemed like it was going to be awesome and just the general hype for it made it seem like it was going to be the best dc movie in a while do not believe the hype nor that this movie is even good because it is notthere is so much cgi in this film that half of the time it doesnt even look real scratch that the entire film doesnt even look real almost every single scene is shot behind a green screen and no practical effects are really even used what makes a superhero movie good is a good villain and amazing practical effects which this film lacks and doesnt even have this movie was made just to market toys and merchandise nothing more it doesnt even capture the spirit of the original storyline it was based off of an utter and total disappointment and definitely not the best dc film in fact i think that marbles the trial of the incredible hulk which is seriously one of the worst superhero movies ever beats out this entertainmentwise,fantasy
this movie changed my perspective on for too long that character has been made the butt of many justice league jokes this movie shows that can kick some serious assthe movie has a lot going on but will manage to hold your attention throughout the film the visuals are stunning if you are a marvel movie fan and you think the dc films are too dark for you i recommend giving this a trydc keep up the great content,fantasy
totally boring i started watching it two months ago and for some reason i was busy for a while so i stopped watching it to this day i dont even want to watch and also i dont remember to continue to watch it,fantasy
work of jason in movie is fantastic i love this movie,fantasy
awesome i enjoyed so muchmarvel is a king for the world of superheroes,fantasy
i knew before i started watching this movie that i might be in for a bit of a stretch but i meancooooommmeeee on is this really what the future of hollywood blockbusters is all about cause if so then im seriously switching to foreign moviesim tired of these movies where it requires zero acting but its all computer effects its like the movie companies think we are getting more and more stupidin my book they need to do better ,fantasy

totally disappointing aesthetics are nothing like zack snyders work which in my opinion make dc movies worth to see black manta acting is a disaster im sorry for the hard words but after waiting so much to see a movie people reaction is natural,fantasy
this movie is a mess the acting is awful except amber heard mara who is good 12 of the time the first 15 minutes are a competition between jason momoa nicole kidman the queen and amber heard for who is the most arrogant stereotyped character kidman usually a great actress comes in a close second to momoma for the most obnoxious characterthen theres the story what an incoherent mess this seems to be something wan struggles with as he had the same problems in star trek 3 which was also an incoherent mess the story has no continuity and only the flimsiest of arcs the characters are the most cliched ive seen in many years i thought it was a spoof at timesi will give wan credit though hes seriously politically correct if theres a box to be ticked irrespective of talent wan will do it however this movie had a black villain and a female who didnt win every fight then the male and female lead werent antagonistic to each other  there was actually some romance naughty naughty mr wan finally kidman and heard become doeeyed and say saved me what a hero i nearly died that was the sort of rubbish that only made it into the worst of movies 5060 years ago far too much of the time i felt like i was watching a bgrade direct to tvthis movie will not stand the test of time there are very few superhero movies that will however this one was definitely below par down there with wonder woman black panther and some of the avengers filmsscore i only gave it 310 because it made me laugh at the stream of cliches and it had nice visual effects of atlantis id almost give it 4 for those two aspects alone however delivering bad performances from defoe and kidman thats hard to do for a capable director so 310 stays,fantasy
i did like the story acting is good and sfx are good too feeling of plasticish though but overall its a good moviesome inconsistencies in its super power for example he jump from an airplane at more than 200kmh and more than 100 meters high but he is hurt by falling from a little building of just few storeyother than those inconsistencies it a good movie i did enjoyed it,fantasy
this was one of the worst dc movies and we know dc been slacking horrible visuals were in 2019 this is unacceptable call of duty and gta have better imagery than this the only good thing about this movie was jason momoa the script was horrible seemed like the riverdale writers wrote it wow im so disappointedcast 0script 5visuals and effect 100,fantasy
worse than b rate movie i had to turn it off after 15 minutes super cheesy super cliche everything story wise machine guns shooting directly at him from 10 feet fine super dramatic everything no substance even in the tiniest bit its sht like this that makes me depressed when it gets good ratings how do i live in a society that can stand disgusting sht like this im literally disgusted,fantasy
unbelievably cheesy and not in a smart or funny way literally plays out like a 80s cartoon and though they have their charm my limit is about 20 minutes before my patience runs out and thats what happened here im not a kid any more and even when i was a kid i really didnt like how bad the writing was but i put with it due to lack of optionsso what is the problem with forced emotional nonsense that did not convince silly story revolving around pollution politics against a group that is supposed to be extremely advanced yet they cant figure out how to contain organize and recycle trash no sign of intelligence in any character they are all emotionally fueled doorknobs the quests in the movie include laughable stuff you find in cgrade video games like retrieve the magic weapon and decode daddies message then to add to the pain a rap version of totos africa nauseating stuffon top of the writing and story there are a lot of plot holes the plot itself is silly beyond belief these bad guys want to take revenge on the surface of earth in a universe that includes the likes of superman and wonder women seriously they cant even figure out trash recyclingits a kids movie might be ok for high schoolers and below but thats about it for everyone else its a chore to watch,fantasy
cgiovercharged clichefilled appallinglyacted thor ragnarokwannabe cheesy romcom careful not to turn up the contrast on your screen cause it might melt your eyes off percy jackson on steroids and acid pirates of the caribbean 2049 dceu proves time and again it deserves to die for good and hope for a better planned reboot with someone at the helm with a more clear and organized vision their own kevin feige because this is just flat out embarrassing 2 hours wasted that ill never get back,fantasy
a thousand other actresses could have played her part how she got it the casting couch must still be a thing,fantasy
i was not expecting this movie to be a patch on the what it deliveredit literally has everything and is very close to the comic book and animated canon apart from hair which like sam jackson nick fury and supes not have red underpants on his costume is actually much better than the source materialapart from that pretty much everything is on there from mera being able to control water to to to so many things fans will so oh thats awesome  i dont want to give stuff awayits ridiculously action packed with insane cgi effects funny tender and just goes from strength to strengthimo its one of the best super hero movies by any studio so farim not even a big fan of kidman or heard and even i have to admit they were both superb in their rolesthere are also hardly any expletives either religious or cussing and its not gory even though it has many many fight scenessuperbly directed with incredible set pieces costumes score etcutterly brillianthighly recommended to young and old,fantasy
the movie is way better than i thought it would be the was nobody in the league and i would therefore assume he is kind of em you know lol but the movie turns out to be quite successful btw i didnt watch it until january as there is literally no other movies that i wanna see just my personal opinion no other meanings lol anyway this is a good one and the background musics are enjoyable as well,fantasy
i read a lot of reviews before i watched the movie and i wasnt sure i was gonna like it because there were very good reviews and very bad ones tooi went to watch it and i liked it i think the movie dos not deserve all those bad reviews because it has great visuals and its an entertaining story i think that is a good film,fantasy
after seeing batman vs superman and suicide squad id started losing hope in the dc cinematic universe then wonder woman and justice league came along is even better its amazing i love the cast and how every character is given life and space to breathe every character is fleshed out its amazing this is definitely my third favorite dceu movieafter man of steel and justice league i hope it only gets better this is the sort of thing needed to keep this cinematic universe alive vibrant and interesting,fantasy
stupid  no script no characters wast of money  nothing in it worth watching except visual effects  very predictable 2 hours and 20 mins from your time you cant bring it back,fantasy
i just watched the movie and i am overwhelmed the story was really nice described everything was explained step by step and it wasnt rushed like some other dc movies there was no boring scenes or not needed ones everything in the movie flew like it should have i loved amber and how she brought us her character i was actually very surprised how good she was and she was actually better than jason to meanother good thing was that battle between brothers didnt last for half an our it was short and sweet just like it has to be and more time was spent on other imortant stuffonly thing that was a bit annoying to me was that the was introduced to us like an idiot he doesnt seem nor smart nor very sharp more like some cocky bullyall in all i loved the movie even the villian was actually interesting which is not the case in every movie and ofc there is also the atlantis world that was so stunning i just loved it and all of the underwater world was shown brilliantly i dont remember a movie that had such pictures and imaginative scenes since avatari would definitely recommend it,fantasy
i love people that blast apart these comic book revival movies for the depth of character predictability and cinematic timing yep its a superhero movie get over yourself was a good movie that did exactly what it was supposed to do entertain most do not go to watch a dcmarvel movie for anything other than to be entertained by their childhood heros ok so i can see getting uptight when they take liberties with the actual structure of the original character but outside of that go watch the green book if you want character development,fantasy
this is exactly like what you would imagine little kids are seeing when they are playing with fake swords  haha so bad and childish,fantasy
without a doubt it is the best dc movie to date and one of the best superhero flicks out there is now a family favorite and so glad they made it appropriate for my whole family to see,fantasy
i could be forgiving of the stiff acting awkward dialogue and messy rambling plot because honestly there were some fun action scenes lets be honest you dont walk into expecting awardwinning acting or screenplay however the cgi animation in some parts was just so bad it was really offputting for me i didnt even know they were capable of such horrible cgi these days im talking about the parts where young was learning how to swim and also when was taken prisoner for the first time in that long white room also towards the beginning when nicole kidman was fighting those people in the living room i mean those parts looked like they were taken from a playstation game from 20 years ago,fantasy
dc trying to hard to be marvel the same issue with suicide squad to much story not enough time,fantasy
the best part about this movie was being able to look at jason momoa the entire time as well as the visual effects were pretty well done every single superhero cliche was present and it was sub par acting i cannot believe people gave this 10 out of 10 wonder woman was 100 million times better,fantasy
it was terrible cliches terrible script and acting predictable plot inconsistent visual effects this movie should never of happened all theee 1010 reviews are jokes,fantasy
not being a superhero fan i was surprised when i was impressed with 2017s justice league was actually my least favorite character but the trailers for his own movie showed sea monsters so that sold it so i saw itfor starters the script written by david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick and will beall is absolutely awful not only can you predict the outcome of the story from the moment the title comes up but the dialogue is bone chillingly bad it is even full of cliches like the du du du music that plays when the villain says something scary it also contains things that i never wanted to see or know like an octopus playing drums and apparently doesnt wear deodorantand then we come to the cast a fair enough group tainted by terrible lines jason momoa quotes his illtimed one liners with all the dignity of smoked ham so yeah amber heard arielmeara graces the screen as your standard tough superhero girlfriend with all the dignity of again a smoked ham patrick wilson the evil orm is generally a talented actor but is ruined by cliche bad guy yelling willem dafoe is impossible to take seriously after his role in mr beans holiday dolph lundgren rides a giant seahorse  and thats about it and finally we come to nichole kidman who looks lovely and doesnt botch her lines or performance she should be apologized to for working with these peoplethe visuals are amazing if a bit overwhelming at times the most impressive advancement of atantis is their waterproof makeup its almost 2 hours into the movie before we see the creatures promised to us in the trailer they are truly the highlight of the film and mostly the reason for my 3 star ratingthis is a long lingering rather dull movie and only watchable if theres nothing else to rent at the video store carson clays playback time i mean uh,fantasy
very well done was surprised to see nicole in this movie pleasant surprisethe movie is not boring at all i got goosebumps and did cry on some occasionsdc may live to see better days ahead,fantasy
with everything i had heard and previews i had seen of this movie beforehand i was expecting something that was truly worth my time but in the first thirty minutes i knew this was to be a huge disappointment as some reviewers explained before the acting is soo cheesy and cocky that it takes away all the interest except from okay performances from willem dafoe and dolph lundgren yes sadlyif dolph is among the good performers of this movie try to imagine the rest and a soso presence from jason momoa the rest of the acting is really really lame lines are delivered with a visibly forced attitude body language is not congruent and exaggerated poses and looks that last too long made me want to stop watching even nicole kidman is not up to the task here or is playing way below her conventional high standards which made her such a famous and sought after actress amber heard probably gives one of the worst perfomances ive seen on screen after kristen stewart in twilight and yahya abdulmateen ii is for sure not helping eitherthis being said the movie is visually amazing even if many computerized graphics are way too obvious  but since when can a movie be qualified as excellent or get such high ratings simply based on this if the visual cannot be supported with strong and believable acting it is simply like a beautiful postcard with nothing written on it so it becomes meaningless and that is what this movie is for me,fantasy
started squirming in my chair from about 30 minutes onward and then had to cover my eyes when nicole kidman emerged during bro showdown to give life adviceplease please do not pay to see this and therefore encourage production of similar garbage,fantasy
couldnt stay awake to this movie fell asleep cant see how people gave this movie a high score must have missed something,fantasy
so many cheesy lines and scenesshots theyve taken something that could be quite cool and turned it into a childrens movievery disappointing,fantasy
movie will be remembered for it visual effects vfx and its screenplay all characters have done best to their performance fast paced story line with no spoilers and full pack of entertainmentvisual effects and movies sets are amazing and breathtaking dc character and its side line characters make this more entertainingmust see movie if you are interested in fiction with visual effects,fantasy
this is so cheezy its terrible they are too many story lines colliding with each others that would deserve their own 2hrs movie and deeper exploration therefore everything is explained quickly and dummed down like a soap opera you do have a fantastic cast on paper and even if youre ready to buy into the whole setup this is an pretty bad end product not sure who is to blame the script the director dc or the producers,fantasy
meh 5 out of 10 i found it quite juvenile and overdone with cgi some character development would have been appreciated,fantasy
i really wanted to like this movie and i am a major fanboy of superhero movies but this was just way way way too much for an origin story the cgi was over the top the explosions were extreme and not needed in every single scene that was shot there were way too many subplots zero character development and lets face itthe jokes were just not really funny is not a great actor  neither was his partner in crime it is not a bad movieit is just really really not good,fantasy
dc is finally making films on the level of the mcu this film brought me and my family so much joy by showing stunning visuals an amazing soundtrack and lets face it jason momoa is a babe in previous adaptations has been kind of cheesy and that is not what we get in this movie theres alot of action in this film and even though the story maybe predictable at times it is no less enjoyable it has only been out for a couple of weeks and i have already seen it twice it is a must see,fantasy
im certain that the high reviews for this movie are from people who have no idea what a story is havent watched the movie or have exceedingly low standards the movie was visually pleasing so props for the effects but it was written by an unimaginative 12 year old sorry 12 yr olds,fantasy
welcome to dc version of thorfull of bad actingand semi high school cgi projectnext to b vs s as the worst dc project,fantasy
excellent movie the amazing visuals and great cast together made this a great watch weve all been waiting for a dc movie to glue us to our seats like the avengers series and finally they came through such a great storyline to give the history of and his creation to the current time of the movie and his epic battle to gain his rightful position in atlantis,fantasy
for a film that was created by many people through time and effort i cannot relate to any character in this film except for mera who seems more decent than jason momoa and themselves are all jerks with egos up their butts and play the same jerk if you pay attention to how jason approaches people jason even ripped amber heards pages from her books without her permission while working with her for the film i dont think i am going to be able to watch another film if hollywood is going to hire unprofessional jerks who dont know how to adapt to different characters and treat people with respect,fantasy
this movie was thoroughly entertaining and had great aesthetics to make up for the c dialogue,fantasy
not a patch on black panther i looked forward to this movie but found it corny and amateurishspoiler alertat one stage after a high intensity scene the princess is playing the fluit which seemed totally out of place in fact a number of audience members started laughing throwing their hands up in the air exclaiming  wtf shame it could have been great,fantasy
achingly repetitive boring and longno chemistry between the leadspoor attempt at humour,fantasy
i give this movie one star for each letter of the word that best describes it d u m b  4 stars in this current age of overhyped superhero films this movie is a formulaic as they get every single occurrence from the ostentatious opening voiceover to the sun rise over dear dads lighthouse is utterly predictable and poorly produced i am ready for a superhero film that doesnt try to rest on the tired laurels of stunning cgi because guess what weve seen it all and we are at full capacity for these expensive light shows give us instead a story some actors and a wellwritten screenplay i more than understand that this movie could not have come off without some cgi but this movie relies on it and would truly be nothing without it it exists as a 25 hour fireworks display with zero substance its got a few big names earning hopefully very large paychecks in order to fund their next real movie ie willem defoe nicole kidman but overall i was embarrassed for them having to stoop to this level in fact i was kind of embarrassed sitting in the theatre proving id paid real money to see this now i do have a soft spot for jason momoa because he was a great khal drogo and seems like a genuinely likable guy i wanted to like him in this but i couldnt due to an abysmal screenplay that no actor could make sound believable too bad all in all id say this is a perfect movie for 10 year old boys,fantasy
good story good acting good character placementgrandsons loved it grandmother enjoyed it,fantasy
why is it so hard to make a good superhero moviethe positives in are fewthe action scenes are good fight scenes were done well i liked the start of the story with atlanna and the lighthouse keeper cgi was also really goodacting was okay i felt sorry for these guys having to recite some of the silly linesthe story just got off track and there were too many dumb momentsif i was 12 years old i would probably have loved this movieoh the soundtrack was pretty bad too,fantasy
many people are saying that this movie is the best dc film it isnt in reality its only ok the acting wasnt great but id blame that more on the cheesy writing the thing that saves this movie are the visual effects and sound mixing both are incredible nothing amazing but also not horrible 710,fantasy
everybody says that this is the best comic book movie ever but they kind of forget 2 things narrative and characters the movie has some issues with these two some characters arent fully developed the story doesnt really have 1 main villain too and the love between mera and feels forcedand this movie is amazing visually the production design is topnotch but to be honest some of the deaging cgi is so obvious that its annoying some models arent fully rendered here and there the story is really full of cliches and that sometimes ruins moments but overall the movie looks and feels amazing due to the charisma of the actors the musical score and the overall comicbooky atmosphere of the movie has some issues but overall worth the wait and worth watchingan extra message for the hardcore dc fans giving this movie 1010 and saying that this is better than everything the mcu could offer is a good movie i think its really well done and dc is improving on their movies shazam i believe will be really good but this movie is still not better than most of the mcu i am more of a dc guy actually but marvel movies are much more consistent with tone and quality with the cgi and with all characters and they are i think overall better movies saying that this movie is better than most mcu movies is just too much and dc doesnt deserve it they should work their asses off to finally give us 1 movie that everyone can say that its great until than i will say that most of their movies are mediocre because they deserve it good luck dc i hope you do what we the fans deserve is a good step in the right direction,fantasy
there are two universes here people who think this is the best movie in the history of movies and people who thought it was horrible reading the reviews i cant find any patterns to clue in to where anyone may fall so my suggestion is to see the movie with an open mind knowing that youll probably either love it or hate it youll know in the first 20 minutes probably then go with the flow,fantasy
may have plot spoilersthe film gives us the origins of who talks to fish sort of like a parseltongue except for fish and sea mammals which are different but not in this story arthurjason momoa first foe is manta yahya abdulmateen ii  and then his halfbrother king and then everyone except amber heardnow arthur cannot become king until he either pulls the sword from the stone or the lost trident from king atlan this isnt any trident it is made will posiden steel and has a genuine corinthian leather grip the script raised some questions why is desperately hanging on to the edge of a roof when he can jump out of a perfectly good airplane without a parachute and why would he take a slowmoving fishing boat anywhere they attempted to make amber heards first time on the surface cute but not clever are atlantians the only sea mammals that never have to breathe airi couldnt help but think of avatarthis needs a 3d imax superman does not die in the endguide language was a little salty,fantasy
omg it was the best dc comics movie ever  jason momoa was amazing and fantastic amber heard was so hot and beautiful,fantasy
this was my first time seeing jason mamoa as a protagonist i was worried if id be able to find sympathy for him but he was fantastic it is definitely my favorite in the dc universe so far they did right with wonder woman now this this another step in the right direction for dc i think they finally realized that not every dc hero movie has to have that superrealistic doom and gloom dark knight tone however i felt it dragged a little in length some scenes didnt keep my attention and i felt were a bit unnessesary,fantasy
this movie may be one of the more visually striking comic movies ever made they clearly put an enormous amount of time and effort into the underwater cgi sequences there were countless times where i thought to myself if you took a still shot of the screen right now itd be a beautiful wallpaper or poster though with all the work that went into the visuals almost none went into the story the plot was as straight forward as it comes which dragged in a 25 hour long movie and the dialogue was painful at timesultimately with all the various pros and cons the movie is entertaining to watch so turn your brain off and ride the wave where it takes you,fantasy
watchable movie with great visual effects all the cast members do justice for their respective roles mind blowing camera work except for the moderate storyline and some visual effects overall good movie a good comeback for dc universe,fantasy
once again dc made you go to cinema and truly immersed all of us into the sea world stunning visuals great actor performance and beautiful story go see it and youll be waiting for sequels,fantasy
torn between two worlds between two styles between two plots is more soggy than a pizza in a salad bowl the screen and the sound were beyond the capability of my senses the ammo is the movies were more like nerfguns the color of the costumes seems inspired from tangled and frozen the tongue in cheek we get to see in marvel is being tried half heartedly that it belongs nowhere,fantasy
this movie has some awesome cinematography and special effects but i felt the story is intended to satisfy young childrenthere is no depth to this film zero dolph lungren was great to see as was jango fett otherwise it was a difficult 2 hours to sit through in a dark room with another adultawkward,fantasy
i thought aqua man was one of the greatest superhero movies it does have its flaws though as a movie but as a fun action heavy superhero movie it knocks it right out of the park jason mamoa takes an otherwise lame super hero and makes it his own also patrick wilson who plays orm is very over the top which is very true to the comic book charecter also the whole movie is just great to look at the cgi looks epic overall if you like superhero movies youll enjoy aqua man,fantasy
as a comic book fan of marvel i am happy to report that surprised me although i am not a hater of dc i am a hater of bad comic book moviesdc has been really hit or miss with their movies but to me this was a hit let me just start by saying i went to see this with my girl a couple and 3 guy friends all of us with different likes 12 liked the movie the 12 not so muchwhy was it goodthe story was a good story giving a outsider feel a reluctant hero of sorts but overall a strong presence jason momoa does a great job of giving a new spin on the comic book version of arthur currythe action was a blast there was a couple of really cool fight scenes and the ending battle was a blastamber heard was better than i thought now lets say she is not going to win an oscar here but she is believable and could handle her owncg was off the hook really amazingimagination was really cool all the different species and monsterswhy was it badwell lets say this was a fondue party cheese was at an all time high so many needless poses from jason and bad one liners nothing that we havent seen in any arnold schwarzenegger or sylvester stallone movie but still more than usual from a dc movieto me it seem like it copied a couple of things from other movies again nothing new but for me to notice its sometimes makes it not so cooloverallyes its corny and cheesy but man was a lot of fun i was impressed by the action and the cg the main stars did a great job playing their superhero characters and i for one think it will come off very well with fans and non fans alikeif you are looking for great acting great story telling well you may be disappointed but if you are looking for a lot of fun which is why i go in the first place then this movie will be great for you enjoy,fantasy
encourage any superhero fans to go check this film out its a blast easily the best dc film yet,fantasy
there is no doubt that the british legend of king arthur played a large role  the character was even named arthur and there was a pivotal sword in the stone scene so if you like such stories will be very appealing what i really liked was 1 spoilers ahead vulko did not die in so many movies the mentor of the hero or heroine  in the case of wonder woman ends up well sleeping with the fish 2 the relationship between mera and arthur it is serious  mera saving him playful and finally romantic in addition both characters grow throughout the movie  always welcome 4 the special effects really worked far too often they are predictable  like in avatar where they created scenes that were supposed to be ground breaking but were rehashes of westerns like the indian campfire and the animals which were obviously stuff like panthers 5 humor too many dc movies lacked humor  suicide squad excluded here you get some without insulting the audience spoilers ahead the scene with the bikers in the bar was exceptionally well done and its outcome was not what i expected basically was my favorite nonbatman dc movie 1010 stars,fantasy
a must watch movie from dcgood plot  action scenes are worth to watch,fantasy
saw this on 3d its very predictable and pretty boring for its length the only thing i enjoyed was the visuals and the undersea world overall i dont think its worth the money and the hype it got,fantasy
this film doesnt take it self to serious what is perfect for the character jason momoa nailed this character the visuals are stunning the characters are fun and story it self isnt too bad great job james wan,fantasy
great action a definite watch comic book fan or notthe last airbender people should definelty take notes from these action scenes,fantasy
as a comic book fan i was genuinely impressed with the film everything was well executed i thoroughly enjoyed this film,fantasy
this was the new mover one noticie of the year better than any marvel movie top quality at first i thought it would suck but turns out its the best,fantasy

the dc extended universe has a spotty record to say the least man of steel had mixed reception batman v superman divided critics and fans alike suicide squad was an overall failure wonder woman brought hope and justice league underperformed financially it was an uphill battle from there and thanks to james wan saw insidious this latest entry struck the right chords like a tidal waveplot arthur curry was born a child of two worlds his father an ordinary lighthouse keeper and his mother queen of the legendary atlantis now he must rise up to realize his destiny as the bridge between land and sea he must journey across the world with the sexy princess mera in order to prevent his halfbrother orm aka ocean master from bringing together the seven undersea kingdoms in order to wage war on the surfacelike wonder woman this film was not bound by excessive sequelbaiting or studio intervention and instead told a complete story into itself and boy was the story something to behold one of love and legacy this film embodies everything that makes such a grand and badass hero he rules 23 of the planet after all and added enough flair and compelling character writing to make it a phenomenal work of art the underwater world is a splendor filled with stunning technology fantastical creatures wonderful colors varied environments and a lore worthy of this world the music by rupert gregsonwilliams definitely left an impression providing the right feelings in every scene all the actors did a terrific job portraying these largerthanlife characters especially jason momoa who made me cheer laugh and root for him in every conflict carrying the right balance of drama and humor and lets not forget the actions scenes which got me excited every time fists water and laser blasts fly the black manta fight and the climactic undersea war had me pumped i also gotta give creds to all the little nods to classic nautical tales and ancient mythologyamazing doesnt even cut it for this one by the time it was over the audience gave an applause something i rarely see in theaters and its welldeserved just like the princess of the amazons the king of atlantis revitalized my faith in the dceu i give this aquatic superhero venture a 9 out of 10,fantasy
dc has finally woken up but just woken up and they still have a lot to catch up as it happened with wonder woman there is hope for dc and this movie is a prove that a job well done is possible when on the right handsthe story takes place after the events from justice league although its like the previous movie didnt exist at all and we are not complaining about it plot is interesting there are no aliens invading us this time its purely a survival matter that happens all underwater of our world most of the movie is underwater so imagine how brilliant and awesome the visual effects are i can only say give them already their oscar please amazing not only all the animals we see but also the clothes and specially the hair of the main characters you feel like you are inside a tank of your towns aquariumall along the movie you will feel like you are watching another movie because at some point there is a mix of other movies or simply things that will remind you of them like riders of the lost ark or avatar and lets not forget that little mermaid moment with the octopus playing the drums fantastic plus the female character reminds us of black widow just kicking asses but with her own power too and shes not just a secondary player marvel please take note on that its like a mix of movies but in a good way not for a minute will you check your watch while watching the filmit seems that dc is finally finding their path with the storylines is as wonder woman was a really entertaining movie it has mythology it has action it has a good speed and it has humor and probably the best visual effects of the year so what are you waiting for,fantasy
until i watched i used to think man of steel was not that a bad movie and it received unjustified criticism but makes superman look uncool is a hero who is a powerful beer chugging brat who saves kids in midfights stops war to minimize casualties and doesnt kill major villains in climatic fights a hopeful borderline realistic joyful and emotional tone is what everyone wants from comic book movies hats off to james wan for creating visuals which are mix of avatar indiana jones jurassic park star wars and pay homage to some of zack snyders work as well  look for swimming straight up to surface  that shot is same as man of steel flight sequence,fantasy
exactly what the title says strange looking creatures space ships swords like combats an evil alliance that threatens the world and a rebel warrior with the help of a princess trying to stop the evil empirewhat not to love thereeven so the movie has its own character which actually make it really enjoyable and interstingstrongly suggested,fantasy
it was the most balanced superhero movie for me its was not a comedy movie it has action story emotion and little bit fun touch to it to not make it super dark movie go and watch it you would love it,fantasy
james wan did a great jobthis movie is absolutely amazing,fantasy
one word for this movietriumphantjames wan reminds us how ok it is to imagine as wide as we can and he did that by by showing us what those imaginations can do the effectsstylecgi and acting were all great but more importantly each scene had you wondering whats going to happen next and what happened next was awesome you relish every scene in this movieif dc and wb carry the universe in this light they could come close to what the mcu has done so far,fantasy
treat my self as someone who doesnt know about  also ignoring the justice leagueoverall i thought it just right amazing cgi nice casting the story is good but its too pacey that made it feels like very complicated,fantasy
enjoyed this film all the way through some of the dialogue was a little rough and the comedy was a bit forced i felt the characters had good chemistry and the story was fun and captivating dc never does a very good job with the villains but this movie was pretty damn good scenes were awesome as they took silly things from the old cartoon and in the comics and made them extremely cool,fantasy
what can i say pretty mediocre movie from start to finish everyone is just here to pick up a paycheck the lead jason momoa is too busy trying to channel nineties metal rockstars instead of trying to play its disturbing at times to see alcoholism being glorified onscreen whats up with that everyone onscreen is going through the motions because theyre being asked to play a part in a movie thats already been done a few dozen times before or more thats been done to death im honestly surprised no one has done a parody of superhero movies yet so many of them follow the same formulathe end was the worst part of the movie nothing was convincing about it amber heard just looked embarrassed she cant act its tragic she totally knew she was on a set doing a movie role for a quick buck she put no effort into convincing the audience of who she was playing onscreenwatch in imax if you can some of the cinematography is just gorgeous yahya abdulmateen deserves some recognition for his part i felt this movie may have been a lot better with him as jason momoa cant act i mean if this was the best you could do at least just cast yahya as the lead he deserves much better and was the one good thing about this film,fantasy
i thought everything about this movie was amazing very entertaining my husband my kids and i all loved it great for all ages good job dc,fantasy
very good movie and vfx effecf and sound system are so nice,fantasy
i am so sick of comic book characters changing color it has nothing to do with racism i am an originalist in almost every movie now we have a main or minor character turn from white to asian black hispanic and now is hawaiiandont get me wrong jason momoa is great for the role and his exotic looks make the character more interesting but he isntthe original 1940s was a regular man who could breathe underwater and control fish and other underwater life for up to a minute and he was whitethe silver age was arthur curry the son of tom curry a lighthouse keeper and atlanna a waterbreathing outcast from the lost underwater city of atlantis and again he was a blonde haired white mani just cant imagine the fallout of turning a long time black character into a white person it would never happenhere is a partial list of characters who have changed colorsonly from whitenick furyhuman torchperry whiteharvey dentdeadshotheimdallalicia masterscatwomankingpinhogunelectrobaron mordocallistojasper sitwelldominomary jane watsonvalkyrie,fantasy
aqua man is funny has awesome story telling and amazing video special effects totally loved it director and actors nailed it,fantasy
all in all move was really great a really bright colourful movie with lots of beautiful animation and cgi nice camera work casting is really good jason momoa really shines he manages to show strength and weakness at the same time when to see this movie with my teen cousin and he really ejoyed it,fantasy
one word super i went to see here in holland with my daughter finally a good dc movie the story line the actors everything was right i loved the jokes the timing was good i have nothing but positive wordt about the movie i was very positive about wonder woman i enjoyed every minute of the movie i am very curious about cyborg,fantasy
fantastic story super acting beautiful movie legendary atlantis super movie awesome heroine beautiful,fantasy
i didnt think it was going to be good and i though it would be very cheesy but khal drogo killed it so many good actors,fantasy
presented in bid d screen projected at single projector top and bottom 3d processthere was no trouble with the 3d presentation perfect too bad stan lee died he usually showed up in these comic strip movie made 3d features of super heroeshe was never able to see the premierethe character were goodbut very confusing there were many super heroes and potentials like black manta and his fatherplayed yahya abdul manteenthe son and michael beach as his father as they fight in a submarine and kills a white manwho might have been a bad guyor was manteen the bad guy but fails to kill aqua man and ends up being being injuredinstead it seems that atlantis was sunken in the oceanbut the people who survived it aqua mother played by nicole kidman had met his father a light house manplayed by temuera morrisonwhen he rescued her from a stormlater they fall in love and aqua would be bornbut then she has to leave her lover because she is still wanted by the enemycausing tem to have to raise aqua himselfwhen he grows up aqua princess meraplayed as a red headportrayed by amber heard and shows up to him and tells him that a war is being started by the bad guys against atlantis head up by king orm who is played by patrick wilson and that he aqua is inherent to atlantis and must com back to the under water and help them the atlantis to winit seems when mera introduces aqua to her king orm does not trust aqua and puts him in a hard duel that mera rescues aqua and both ends up in adventures in an underground of a desert to greece where mera eats flowersbut more of the bad guys shows up and they have to fight it seems like the bad guys look like a dinosaur whale combo crocodile half mana percentage of the story is adapted form the king arthur storiessince aqua man name is arthur and the huge monster he has to deal withreminds you of lord of the ring dragonwhen aqua fights to get the sword that is held by the corps well preserved in water of king atlanplayed by graham mctavishit seems there is another enemy too king nereusplayed by dolph lundgen everyone is fighting to take over atlantis so they can take over the land and attack the humansthis is what princes mera is trying to stopthis film was very impressive in 3d like creature from the black lagoonthe under water set were impressive of the citybut whats good is that the story just like in ready player onestands out and can be enjoyed equally in 2d also there could be another sequelbecause near the end you see manta recovering from a woundlooks like he at a house of some scientist and a bomb goes through the ceiling almost hitting the scientistand he is wanting revenge against aqua and thinking about his next plans for thatgood entertainment 122118,fantasy
this has to be one of the most beautiful comic book movie ive ever seen the script is okay but the vfx and cinematographt are spectacular the fight scenes are also awesome jason momoa and patrick wilson absolutely nailed their roles as arthur curry and orm marius,fantasy
momoa is the director did a good job keeping the audience entertained momoa did a good job not overplaying a character just keeping it as hawaiians would say just cruisin,fantasy
ive watched this 3 times now and it gets better every time yes there is silly little plot holes any one can pick out mistakes in a movie it is comic book accurate a visual master piece people on here giving it a 1 or 2 or 3 are pathetic its a seven at least if you dont like it but i loved it best superhero movie imo james wan has done it made a dc movie no real fan can complain about its epic cant wait for the 4k release mr wan take a bow momoa is cant wait for sequal,fantasy
well worth the wait and in my opinion fixed all the problems of justice league sure few cheesy moments and some cgi didnt look that good but its what i expect out of a superhero film being set under water all in all almost everything else in this film worked i was on the edge of my seat all the way through this is jason mamoa and amber heards real chance to shine together and all the side characters were great as well it also had real emotional moments i would suggest seeing this and if you havent seen justice league yet just please skip over that movie,fantasy
so glad they didnt rush the story to make it under 2 hrs  dc did follow the story like they did with wonder women and made it right they took their time to explain the story could have done a little more but a very good job excellent special affects  the acting from everyone you can tell enjoyed them selves making and putting this movie together will see it again,fantasy
im not sure why critics look to this movie as a relic of the previous dc movies though its full of story action logic and the villains quality is so dense you need to enjoy the movie multiple times just not to miss any of the detailsalso the movie has such light mix of comedy and drama in bits so its not dark like many critics complained some movieswan and dc have done good by and the fans as well keep it up,fantasy
 is basically an ocean version of got except it manages to tell the whole story in 25 hour while got has spent 8 years to tell,fantasy
from the start of dceu with mos is the first flick that leave me a great relieve after walking out the cinema mos is great and snyders vision indeed is something that is special for dceu complex but that was not for everyone ww is also something special but it left us with not to satisfying with its main villain bvs is perfect but only for its ultimate edition while proved to be a solid part of dceu with its specific tones but with an improved refreshment in the atmosphere and visual cinematography yet its not overflowed to be similar with mcu overall this flick is so recommended and it wouldnt let u down after exiting the theater and dont trust anyone who said this flick is a boring one ,fantasy
this movie is visually beautiful action packed and there is never a slow moment ocean master and blacked manta looked like they were plucked from the comic book pages and dropped right on to the movie screen dont listen to the so called critics go see it for yourself and make your own judgement,fantasy
this movie was entertaining cgi was great this was something different to watch for a change,fantasy
literally blown away after watching on imax and 3d one of the first time when almost everyone applauded the movie at the endgreat visuals and soundtrack keep you on the edgedefinitely recommend it,fantasy
this movie is at another level best dceu movie  the first dceu film which is better than many mcu movies i love both thoughjason momoa as is just perfect every fight scene every stunt has been executed beautifully visuals are mind blowing if you love superhero movies just go and watch ,fantasy
suspend all disbelief my mortal crusaders has arrivedthis is a comic book movie that knows whatit is and revels in its total disregard for realityits a movie its an escape and directorwriterjames wan takes you on one of the greatestescapes of allstarringjason cgi as cgimanamber cgi as cgimerapatrick cgicgi dafoecgi kidmandolph cgicgi abdulmateen iithe voices ofcgi andrewsjohn cgidaviesdjimon cgiand introducingcgi cgi as cgicgialso it was a pleasure to see ablack man playing a characterwith black in its name that hasnothing to do with racial tonesand thanks to the snyders forparticipating in the production,fantasy
to be totally honest and up front i am personally suffering from comic book film fatigue at the moment there is just an over saturation id even go as far to say that i am getting less and less bothered or interested in them the more that come out i am more of a dc fan than marvel but i have enjoyed films from both however i really couldnt care less anymore maybe thats just mewith that overly long intro out of the way onto the film itself which i have to say i am very conflicted on because there are parts i really enjoyed but that there are also parts that were just ok for me unfortunately though that is the overriding feeling after viewing this film is that it is just ok which is a real bummer because i go into every film hoping to love itlets start with positives firstly james wan wow can that man direct this probably from a visual standpoint one of the most amazing and breathtaking comic book films youre going to see some of the visuals underwater in the world of atlantis are just incredible and more importantly the camera work throughout some of the action scenes idea of showing two different action scenes going on simultaneously switching between the two without cutting away is a brilliant way to give perspective on the overall area and scale of the action overall though it is nothing less than i expected from wan because he is an uber talented director and he definitely added something fresh to comic book films in that respectstrangely i thought that jason momoa was a good as i thought he was gonna be nothing spectacular but not terrible either however i think there are couple other performances that really stood out to me firstly nicole kidman she is one of the best around today period so it shouldnt really be a surprise that she is really good but you do worry now and then when you here about a huge name staring in a film like this are they just doing it for the pay check i thought her performance was really strong and is the heart of the film even though she has limited screen time every time she does appear on screen she is a scene steeler overall top class the other scene steeler and this one was a shock is amber heard as mera now this might be just me but im not the greatest amber heard fan dont actually think shes that good an actress average at best maybe a little harsh wow has this got to be her best performance of her career as of yet she commands the screen whenever she is on and i think she does a better job of carrying the film than momoa as soon as she is introduced to us you immediately warm to her or just latch onto her character and her motivations however the best thing and probably the most harshest thing i could say is that she wasnt playing amber heard she was actually playing a characterdo you get what i mean maybe my bar is set really low for her and actually this isnt really that good but who knows reallyeach to your ownall the other performances are really strong patrick wilson willem dafoe and even dolph lundgren they all do well in there respective rolesnow onto the negatives firstly the tone of the film which needless to say is all over the place in a way it sort of reminds me of the tone of justice league or some of the marvel films one minute begin serious the next second being light hearted out of nowhere there are so many ups and downs with the tone that it never really felt like an overall theme or tone to latch ontois it just me or am i going crazy i cant quite put my finger on in it but there was just a strange tonedid we really need the character of black manta and hes substory there is a lot going on in this film and i just think it might have been helped a little with a bit more of a simpler story with less characters the character of black manta although there was nothing wrong with the character itself or yahya abdulmateen ii performance its just felt a little shoehorned infinally there wasnt anything in the film that made my jaw drop or was really fascinated by ermcant find the words to describe it really the film was just fine there was a lot of it that was forgettable not because it was bad but it wasnt really that great ah thats it there was no great moments in the film for me plenty of fineok moments some good directing and performances but nothinggreatoverall this film is just 65 out of 100 or 65 out 10 it is okaverage which is a real bummer because if youd told me that about 2 and a bit years ago i wouldnt have believe you im just a bit worn out with these films whether that is marvel and sadly even dc now and boy have i given dc some passes recentlyim looking at you justice league bvs and suicide squad some good directing from james wan two standout performances from nicole kidman and amber heard but as i said nothing greatjust fine,fantasy
the cinematography is excellent my kids enjoyed it the storyline is not boring but not top notch either,fantasy
this was a very enjoyable movie a lot of action which made the movie fun to watch the visuals were beautiful in this movie jason momoa is a excellent his one line cracks are funny and match his character this was a great movie story well donedirecting and writing goodi dont see anyone not liking this moviea good time all around,fantasy
very entertaining good plot but the trailers gave much of it away compelling characters and a damn good visual treat this movie should really put the dceu back on track,fantasy
well another blockbuster with too much emphasis on the visuals and no much care for everything else a somehow uneven script trying to connect an undersea story with an on the ground plot i had a hard time trying to feel confortable with the connection of these 2 dimensions i enjoyed the undersea battles though the worst part for me was the beyond dull characters that populated this movie father sorry for that guy but it was like the opposite of substance as well as the bad guy with a gun that looked like extracted from a gangsta movie from the 80s i gave this film 5 stars because the protaginist did a good job and he seems to be like a cool guy in real life also the visuals were good and oh one the best actors on the planet got a role here guess who,fantasy
in the movie does a beautiful job at being both a sequel to justice league as well as an introduction of the origin story through its use of flashbacks that didnt jar the viewer out of the tempo of the film hopefully the dceu bosses can remember how to replicate the feeling of this movie and how it was done in their future stand alone character filmsin most movies an actor and their character tends to steal the spotlight whenever on screen and jason mamoa skirting the line between hero of the common man man who would be king and hero of all shows his ability to be a mixture of a man who wants to help others without recognition doesnt want or like to take himself so serious and finally becoming the man his mom told him about in atlantian fork stories momoa shows the hurt he has when thinking that he was the fault of so many peoplesoverall the characters and use of beautiful colors and backgrounds the interwoven mix of the past and the present to tell the story as well as the origin story of help the movie to become the second strongest film of the dceu by a very wide margin,fantasy
eye popping scenes cinematography is top notch extra ordinary stunts scenes terrific bgmracy screenplayall characters done great job hats off to james wan what a imagination perfect feastkudos to the team,fantasy
i just watched this movie yesterday and i would like recommend to u guys to watch this i feel this movie is not like the other dceu movie the plot story character visual etc are great the most improvement in situational comedywell done,fantasy
well done james wan for his first dc instalment this is much better than zack snyders batman vs superman and justice league some of the dialogues were quite funny and amber heard is cool,fantasy
i watched this with an early viewing thanks to prime it was well worth seeing in theaters for the visuals and camera work aloneprosvisually stunning the world of atlantis is so beautiful and the costumes are wonderfuljames wan elevated the source material i fully expect people to take seriously nowjason momoa is a very charismatic lead i was concerned going into it because i didnt care for his conan movieamber heard does a great job as mera shes just like her comic book counterpartpatrick wilson is a good foil to momoasnicole kidman and willem dafoe are great in their parts but they arent in the movie that muchgreat environmental messagethe second and third acts come together nicelyconsblack manta felt like an afterthought i had to mark off for thati feel like their saving him for a sequel or justice league moviesome of the dialogue and music choices dont work at timesfirst act feels a little bit rushed,fantasy
really well done probably my second favorite movie in the dceu the visuals are great the soundtrack is great and jason momoa as is great the only problem is some of the jokes i think it would have benefited if it was darker but it was overall a pretty solid movie,fantasy
just watched the movie and a really enjoyed it not quite the movie i thought it was going to be but it was a good solid enjoyable flickjason momoa is really good tough as nails and delivers lots of little bits of humour doesnt take it self to seriouslydifferent from wonder women and loads better than justice league,fantasy
its alright some bits were good some bits were boring some bits were fun some bits were silly i wouldnt be rushing to watch it again i liked mera orm and black manta,fantasy
  went with sum restrictions seeing underwater world  superhero after all what can one do  visualize with this dark rusty blurred world james wan spins this rare theme on its head  gives us a heady cocktail with a light hearted superhero the world is dark yet colourful  vibrant in colours  characters the director is brave in his use of imagination  strokes of underwater creatures while it does have sum similarities of black panther step brothers vying 4 d crown but its twisted by a fun joy ride involving a treasure hunt while not revealing much its a mighty comeback of dceu 45 for  mamoa is brilliant  modern  funny ladies get ample judgment length is d only deterrent in this otherwise epic adventure james wan single handedly ressurects dceu  how,fantasy
we all wanted dceu to be good like mcu wonder woman is the only decent movie so far in dceu has helped dceu to be back on track it has a very good plot excellent visual effects brilliany star cast etc overall it is a decent movie it is not like any movie in mcu in my opinion as some said it is similar to thor has its own style of narrative and place comparing to any other super hero movie jason mamoa did a very good job but it is amber heard who stole the show shes a real bad ass as mera watch in the best theatre in your town it is worth watching and you will have a very good time,fantasy
spoiler reviewthis movie is entertaining begining to end it flowed so well the cinematography and scenes were so well done and so are the characters  love jasons performance and how james wan showed is more than just a king and has a lovely relationship with his father mera and atlanna especially when author gets to see her when he goes to find the tridentmera  amber heard is literally born to play mera she is such a strong bad ass and empowered superhero i love how she constantly has to help author become a king and love the beautiful kiss at the end i enjoyed that mera was no damsel in distress she took care of herself i loved that mera and author worked as a team not just one saves another overall amber killed it and mera is badassocean master  loved how patrick wilson protrayed orm orm was a great villain but even though hes the main villain black manta definitely got some rounds handed to but orm all in all was great and actually has great reasoning to attack the surface because of us killing the oceans with pollution he also had great fights with and i love the dialogue he has such a well read scriptblack manta  fantasitc love how comic accurate he is and i loved how they went for the new 52 storyline for him this whole movie is pretty muched based off of new 52 which is my personal favorite version of comics fights scenes were amazing with him and just everything was spot onatlanna  nicole kidman was beautiful and amazing as always so happy james kept her alive also every character who wasnt necessarily the main role had a good amount of scenes and overall didnt feel like they were rushed or poorly written in the movieeverones role had a purpose and was so well written and this movie by far is the best cgivfx of this year most parts i total forgot that the underwater scenes were cgi because of how amazing everything was it wasnt a cgi mess like some other movies this year that im not gonna mentionbut please go watch you will be washed away from awesomeness definitely believe the hype this movie is worth seeing in the biggest screen possible,fantasy
i wasnt expecting anything more than a normal dc action movie however the feeling i had inside the cinemas was way different and extravagant for a person who loves swimming and being in water this movie will be a treat special effect an addon they tried some hilarious moments like marvel even though they werent upto the mark i loved it go for it ,fantasy
 will blow your mind james wan has made avatar under water dramatic and spectacular the best dc comic movies ever present by briliant james wan,fantasy
i waited till this was on netflix and i was sick so anything mindless would be bearable1 point for mindless1 point for not paying extra1 point for excellent effects7 points forterrible actingterrible scriptall the tropesdisney musicterrible one linersutterly predictablea great popcorn movie is id4 aliens mib ghostbustersthis needed to be flushed,fantasy
couldnt watch it to the end it was that bad pushing a submarine to the surface in the early scenes should have been enough but i foolishly persisted eventually it got so cartoonish and ridiculous that i called it a day,fantasy
this was just plain bad glad i waited until it was free,fantasy
theres not much chemistry between jason and amber the storyline is lame it was so disappointing because you have this big sexy man and you think hes gonna be kicking ass but everything is so lame no excitement,fantasy
thoroughly enjoyed watching it  great cast  great action sequences  fantastic underwater scenes  great storyline,fantasy
this is a film that caters to fans but goes a little too far i dont know the lore of but i know that how it has been applied to this film is a poor attempt and a ridiculous adaptation jason is the perfect fit so it is a shame that this happened,fantasy
im going to say right away that i hate the dc extended universe out of the movies ive seen from the series batman v superman suicide squad and justice league i have not liked a single one of them in fact they just might be up there with the worst movies i have ever seen however i cant believe im saying this i really enjoyed yeah the movies starring some of the most iconic and beloved dc characters hated them the movie based on arguably the stupidest dc character that is pretty much only popular because hes seen as a joke i really liked it it had fun action a brisk pace that took you all over the place a light tone that didnt take itself too seriously enjoyable characters to go on an adventure with and breathtakingly beautiful colours imagine that a dc movie thats bright and colourful im a sucker for neon and bioluminescence especially avatar tron legacy and blade runner are some of my favourite movies for that aspect alone and this movie has a lot of that some of the cgi looked a little phoney at times almost like a video game cutscene but that just added to the charm in my opinion another thing i really appreciated was the fact that it was a standalone film with little to no connection to the other movies theres a loose connection to wonder woman and a reference to justice league but thats it this is the kind of movie they shouldve been making for the dceu from the beginning im glad that they seem to be going in this lighter more fun direction rather than the dark convoluted zack snyder stuff i highly recommend this movie if you just want to have a good time its the little mermaid meets indiana jones meets black panther featuring battle sharks crab people and dinosaurs doesnt that sound awesome if it does youll like this movie a lot i think im gonna go watch wonder woman and shazam now maybe i do like the dceu after all,fantasy
 is the 5th outing for the dceu and well it sure is prettythats really all there is to all style no substance visually its what i imagine a drug trip to look like so many bright swirling colors vivid and vibrantthe biggest problem this movie has isnt actually its problem its the dceu that its forced to be a part of the kaleidoscope of colors in are stunning but are a complete departure from the rest of the universe its set in jason mamoa is a fun guy to watch and has real potential as an action star but broseidon of justice league still lingers in memorywere this a stand alone film it might rank higher for me sadly that isnt the case and the crushing disappointment that is the greater dceu weighs heavily on atlantean shoulders,fantasy
this is quite possibly the worst movie ever created what a miss for a decent superhero film not worth your time trust me,fantasy
i was quite disappointed that this movie didnt live up to my expectations its plot is quite interesting and although its predictable its definitely entertaining it was though quite cringey the colours and costumes were excessive even for a sci fi action movie the target market seemed to be aimed at 12 year olds rather than adults and while it did have some good special effects its safe to say that dc has done far better in its past movies,fantasy
mamoa is great i enjoy his movies but it was a ton of okish cgi i expected a lot of cgi considering it is underwater but it just wasnt that good patrick wilson was really good in it though,fantasy
i dont know why people love it so much i watch and it wasnt like what people said,fantasy
a fun movie and jason momoa is good asarthur curry however the movie seems to borrow heavily from thor ragnarok which is a superior and better made movie the story is simple but the underwater talking voices can be irritating and there are many underwater kingdoms to track of its a colorful movie there is plenty of action and some nice locations as far as comic book movies go is slightly better than average,fantasy
switch your brain off because thats the only way you will enjoy thisterrible storyterrible actingsome well done action scenesmy friend said he thought this was a childrens movie and could no believe it was rated mcharacters look like poweranger villainsterrible,fantasy
too bloated in runtime too much cgi filling up the screen and too genericderivative of many other superhero filmswas interesting how momoa was going to go considering the original source material being that is usually portrayed as such cleancut blonde haired type but glad they gave the character edge considering thisprobably one of the better dc films just wish studios would keep films to a 2 hour runtime and lose some of the unnecessary filler for a predictable ending,fantasy
id seethis movie and like it your just anothet nationalsitoc australian for sure irwas total garbage,fantasy
this has nothing absolutely nothing to do with this is just hollow cheap entertainment fit to satisfy the masses bad jokes one dimensional characters a really trashy villain this is so bad it hurts i think this is supposed to be a loose adaptation of the new 52 run on but the result is only a disappointing mix of elements from the comics screwed and wasted the trench wasted mera screwed black manta wasted completely screwed jason momoa as an actor for completely wasted although i believewith the right script and production he would have been greatand please be aware that i write this as a true fan of dc graphic novels and moviesi think this is a perfect example of what happens when cinema is made to make hundreds of millions and not to be art,fantasy
the thing that bothered me about this movie is that mantra is so smart and can change atlantean technologies but yet when his father is trapped under a missile he isnt smart enough to get a pry bar to use to lift the missile also using nicole kidman as the mother was not a good choice she just isnt believable as a strong underwater woman why are all the women in their 50s getting face lifts she cant show any feelings with her face because it doesnt move at all not even her lips jason momoa and amber heard were the best parts of the whole movie if someone could write a good script with better lines in it they would have a great movie,fantasy
i liked all the graphics the development under the sea and the message they wanted to convey conservation of sea and the harm human have created by garbage and plastics,fantasy
this movie is simply terrible it is the perfect example at the quality of movie that is coming out of the minds in hollywood the writing is at a solid 1 star with boring bubblegum story lines how can anyone sit through this entire movie is just a terrible moronic movie that is a solid waste of your life if you choose to watch it,fantasy
the movie provides a fun summer blockbuster with special effects action and entertainment galore the actors all have their charm and the cinematography has that hollywood sheen to it there are just a few things i cant ignore that glaringly bothered meits downright offensive how many scenes this movie downright steals or copies from other films tron fifth element indiana jones to name a few the cheesy dialogue at moments didnt help either,fantasy
start with the good  i appreciated the casting and there were some beautiful things to look at next quick vent  why cant be organic  there are some fierce and creatures in the ocean and a nod to ocean preservation i mean cmom okay the dialogue was not enough  the cgi weird st times and well its a 5 but i appreciate dc trying they are but are too cool,fantasy
not sure how people rate so many movies 1010 thats reserved for masterpieces like 2001 a space odyssey which come along once in a blue moon its a typical mordern superhero film spoilt by too much obvious cgi,fantasy
james wan knew exactly what he was doing here is a return to classic cheeseball superhero cinema the narrative may be sloppy the music may not always set the appropriate tone the villain may be way over the top but you will have a blast with this movie is here to entertain and entertain it does the themes are hinted at throughout but the main goal of wan is to have a good time even if that means throwing all logic out the window if you are the type to over analyze movies this is not for you but if you are willing to flip your brain switch off and have a great time this movie could not be more perfect for the occasion,fantasy
inconsistent thats a problem that plagues this film from start to end as a prime example some cgi effects are spectacular some not so much compositing is atrocious amber heards red hair frequently has a white glow around it because the composite work looks like it was done in minutes on a 5 budget and whats with the horrific antiaging effects at the start of the movie the actors looked like they had rubber masks glued to their facesthe direction is just as up and down as the script tone is all over the place goofy one moment serious the next and then back to complaining about missing happy hour at one point by our hero wonder womans excellent story provided some hope for dcs film universe but didnt carry on with the work,fantasy
 they havent gone though puberty yeti rate some and rarely write reviews but i mean good god this is frikkin bad,fantasy
to be honest the concept of could easily have fallen flat on its face but somehow it doesnt its visually impressive and jason momoa manages to make it believable however that is not enough the storyline feels mindlessly lightweight with its clich violence and predictable romance in spite of the excellent cgi and the environmental message it tries to convey it just doesnt resonate enough its certainly not as terrible as tom cruises mummy what is but its not that great either the dialogue is pathetic at times and a lot of the action scenes feel way too long and only made to fill out time and mask a lack of substanceif there is a follow up i really hope the authors work harder on the script and rely less on cgi saving the day,fantasy
my expectations were so high because im a true dc and marvel fan but this movie had all the clichs it was so predictableand the monster was the tip of the iceberg didnt know i was watchinggodzilla or lotr,fantasy
i never write reviews on imdb but dont waste your time and money on this one the acting is overall bad and actors like willem dafoe just dont have any interesting lines or scenesthe story is almost nonexistent predictable and filled with cliches there is no chemistry between arthur and meta at all nonethe film mostly consists of special effects maybe it a movie theater this is cool that could be why it managed to get a 7 but on a tv screen its too detailed and even chaotic at timesthe fight scenes are not exiting at all and even the jokes dont cause a smile on your facewhy then a 3 not a 1 jason momoa looks great the golden suit is nicely done and also the special effects to get everyones hair waving like in water is realistic but that is really it good luck making it to the end if you decide to watch it,fantasy
i think the fancy sound effects and cg colorful underwater landscape put us viewers in a trance cuz that was some wacky scenes  the movie gives the viewer no emotional grip to any scene  however i felt joy once i found out this was apparently a comedy cuz i was lmfao at scenes especially when nicole kidman fought water power rangers or when the guy spends countless hours building a deep ant man underwater suit only to fight aqua man on land i think he yelled i am black manttaaaaa  they had an indian jones like scene for no reason positives are they have ariel in the movie that delivers dry one liners  cool visuals of coursei could go on all day and night  i recommend you watch this move high or drunk only for the best experience,fantasy
too long  if the movie had finished half an hour ago id give it 70 if it was over 45 minutes ago i would give 80 overkill,fantasy
i was so much hyped when i saw the reviews and the lenght of the movie but after going in the theater the movie was engaging in the start but afterwards it feels like they are trying to show too much and unnecessary scenes the cinematography and camerawork is amazing  but the pace of the drags in the middle,fantasy
it was ok my daughter and i kinda looked at each other during hokey parts and were bored the bad guy was not a good fit and manta was more of a pest than a bad guy too many silly parts but enjoyed jason he did a good job for what he was given to do,fantasy
the story leaks from holes and the plot is not coherentjason momoa is as bad as he usually isa lot of action and great effects but the choreography is badthe movie tries to be funny but it is just stupida waste of time,fantasy
i didnt expect much from this film to be honest not like the dceu has inspired much confidence lately and came out pleasantly surprisedthis is a decent film not bad at all but couldve been better in some aspects although considering i had fun in most parts of the movie i think its a step in the right direction for dcoverall better than justice league and suicide squad both 610 for me but worse than wonder woman or man of steel both 810 for memy rating 710,fantasy
im a superhero junkie but please what was that lots of loud music lots of animation glowing fish blah blah blah dialogue those guys at dc need to catch up to marvel slow down the speedy soulless banter and get some good actors to carry the scenes oh im disappointed grew up on dc comics but this was more like a disco club portrayal of vacantyheroglitz yow bad movie,fantasy
i waited for it to come out on red box before i watched this movie and i so wish i hadnt it was an awesome movie both the story and the effects were greatthis is a spectacular movie for anyone even if you are not into super hero movies i cant wait until 2 comes out i will be watching it in the theater,fantasy
such a bad writing everything was too banal and chaotic sometimes the music they chose was completely not suitable i had many hopes for this movie but i am highly disappointed in its outcome,fantasy
honestly i just kept on watching it for the action the rest is just a big big fail,fantasy
this film just was loaded with too many clichs i was highly disappointed when watching it because of jason momoa himself  him playing his role superb this film got a 6 the plot was also terrible they shouldve showed more of his youth,fantasy
it was bad no other words to describe it other than hot steamy garbage from a sewer,fantasy
why do feel as if dc copied marvel studios with this film the scenes are brighter and i noted the scene that comes after the credits are shown thats been a signature marvel feature for years now,fantasy
superhero movies have moved into two separate fields the dark realistic kind the dark knight trilogy and the more cartoon like mcu this movie falls into the latter with stunning cgi great music and score and action sequences design for the big screen think imax big and for all reviewers who complain about trivial things motion pictures are the collaborated efforts of producers directors and everyone involved sadly sometimes the vision isnt the same between these individuals and causes massive box office failure fantastic four justice league so when it works it works like you have an entertainment piece,fantasy
props to dc for including every conceivable cliche in this movie combined with terrible dialogue and writing,fantasy
so yeah the tone and backstory to all the characters was very interesting to see unfold all throughout the first actthen when the two leads have to head to the sahara desert were met with an odd music choice of a pitbull song in slow motion for no reason the two act like children and try to force chemistry between themselves in a very cringe worthy manner i laughed at all the wrong things when they were in italy look for a quick shot of a guy biting fruit and going cross eyedits hilarious and then when the action comes back the tone is back from the first act but is now riddled with predictability and convenient plot points just to get to the endthe visuals are impressive the action is solid but i wouldnt recommend it as one of dcs absolute best,fantasy
the story was quite predictable but the fight and action scenes were the best,fantasy
it was mediocre predictable unrelatable unrealistic in fairness aqua man is a difficult hero to pull off they should have played it with the making of of it style like marvel did with ant man the comics were so unrealistic that to portary them on the screen does best with a comical approach this was the dc equivalent of iron man 2 its quality is disputed is is below wonder woman and shazam but above batman v superman and justice leagueon a side note why do the suits of armour look like the villains out of power rangers,fantasy
why invest in so much flash and so little in script,fantasy
i dont know where to start with this one but ill trythe storyline nothing is happening and they are showing us this in the most boring and predictable way you can imaginethe dialogues they are like watching a childrens cartoon show with robotsthe characters what characters we didnt get to know them because of bad writing and too many fight scenesthe cliches you can get drunk everytime you notice a cliche stolen from other movies in this one we have everything mixed in here the rotating camera the spinning camera the tiny ships fighting giant monsters the pretty girl who wears waterproof makeup all the time falling in love with the main character while being engaged to his evil blonde brother and so on its painful i was thinking all the time how did the poor actors feel when they had to partake in this horribly unoriginal storythe visual effects i dont know if this is a movie from 2018 or 2001 buffy the vampire slayer from the 90s has better visual effects than this most time i was thinking that im watching a video gamethe underwater world looks like it somewhere in deep space everything is minimalisticly pure white clean and shiny they just could have watched disnyes arielle and see how their underwater castle was build of corals algae clams and other naturally occuring underwater plants and rocks but no they have shiny copper and white glas or somethingthe looks of the villains is just stupid one looks like a giant ant which doesnt make sense why would a human make a mask with a huge head to drag around all the others look like transformers or some spaceships,fantasy
i only write this after reading so many bad reviews the movie was good and worth the watch but most people on here seem like they dont give anything a chance my wife barely watches movies and she actually liked this a lot not sure what people were expecting that was missing but i thought it was a pretty damn good movie if superhero movies are your thing and youre not some hipster dweeb youll enjoy it,fantasy
 is a super hero movie based in the dc comics the production of the movie started getting in production at late november 2016 as cast members we have jason momoa as arthur curry  amber heard as y mera xebella meraa willem dafoe as nuidis vulko patrick wilson as the ocean master and nicole kidman as atlanna this is an action movie and is basically directed to ages of sixteen and on because it has strong language and scenes but some fans are very young age and the best option is going with their parents some part of the audience thinks this movie was not as how it supposed to be like in the comics and some other part of the audience thinks that this movie was one of the best made about this character this movie showed a lot of good special effects and action considered that it is a super hero movie and some type of fight scene should happen it was well do it under water where is all about this is a movie that at first you will think twice to watch if you are not a fan of superhero movies but when the movie begins this attached feeling to the movie will come immediately and the movie will be well enjoyed in general the movie was really good with good special effects good fighting scenes great music and very good acting especially form the main character who in my perspective it was the best from all the cast the main actor jason momoa made a really good job giving live to this character and i think the audience who really loves this comic will be pleased with his work overall the movie was really good personally i am not a big fan of super heroes movies but this one deserves a try in my opinion i would give this movie a 8510 if you have not seen it then you should watch it and enjoy the 2 hours of movie time,fantasy
good movie but story could be more instresting jason mamoa is my favorite,fantasy
to this day the best movie dceu has provided it is still wonder woman falls into a second place it is mainly a decent film with several flaws i cant get over the fact of how dreadful the cgi is i mean i can understand that in the dcus first movie they may not get it right but after several releases and millions of viewers complaining about that same aspect why wouldnt they try to improve it fails to deliver a believable proportion of action and visual effects in terms of how realistically they should go together black manta was such a weak rival poorly acted unlike the rest of the cast whom i thought did a pretty good job jason momoa is fantastic as the titular character amber heard and william dafoe properly delivered mera and vulko nicole kidman was fairly good in her portrayal of atlanna and patrick wilson did a phenomenal task in giving life to king orm some visuals were cool some of the music was not pitbull the scene in italy was fantastic i had a blast watching thati am almost certain that if the cgi had been great it would have changed my vision regarding the picture as a whole but to me it was entertaining nonetheless the cast is what does it for me the story could have been a lot better or it could have been executed in a more nongeneric fashion i have to give it to jason momoa from the moment he was cast we all knew he had a difficult task in playing a superhero that has been a laughing stock for decades and yet he made cool for nearly everyone although the arthur curry from the dc animated universe is badass as well decent effort from dceu but i expect much more as im sure many other fans do too,fantasy
i was looking forwards to seeing this film it wasnt as good as i hoped it would be the story line was okish if it wasnt for momoa then it wouldnt have been worth watching,fantasy
this wasnt absolutely a perfect dc film but is close still is a lot of fun so a lot of would find it ok,fantasy
finally dc made something that can compete with marvel the combination of jason momoa and amber heard really worked well and i really enjoyed this movie you have adventure myths legends sea world one on one fights army fights giant monsters and more if you are on the fence about watching it  dont the movie is worth your while enjoy,fantasy
the movie takes marvel sequels to another level as the first being told in an underwater environment amazing cast at all levels the character of hesitant hand led throughout the movie casts a bit of doubt although part of the plot looking forward to the sequel,fantasy
nothing new is brought to the table with this movie outcasted princeking wants nothing to do with the throne girl is engaged to villan who she wants nothing to do with prince and girl go on a journey together and fall in love blah blah blah same ol same ol cheesy one liners too we didnt hit something something hit us eye rolli couldnt really feel development his character was stoic and he had the same attitude the whole time just spoke diffrent words why cant two characters just go on a journey together and not have to kiss nothing intimate or important happened between the too to make me believe they now love each other they touch hands he holds her a little and bam thats it no chemistry between the two no deep conversation about how they view life or any real deep character beliefs oh and we please stop casting micheal beach as the evil guy as soon as i saw him i knew he was the bad guy barfoverall weve seen this plot many times before,fantasy
first of all i think it was an unexpected filmwhat fascinated me the most was the story behind itjason momoa the main character is in the process of selfdiscoveryalso a fight between good and bada topic that attracts a large number of fanssecondlythe graphics were amazingfull of color and light the film attracted much attention on it the characters were carefully chosen but i think that other actors could be chosen different in some cases that it would be a minus of the filmi think its one of the best marvel movies ive ever seen being curious about the next scene in every momentfinallyi think that watching this movie at the cinema brings a big plus because the atmosphere is differentthe sound filled the room and you felt like you were there in the moviesurely one of the most vivit movies seen lately,fantasy
this movie is great its a fast paced thrilling adventure that puts the dceu back on track its eye popping vibrant visuals make for some phenomenally shot sequences and one of the most bonkers films ever made this does mean that the film seems quite hectic and the story is rather rushed and crammed with details the comedy is pretty cheesy but i dont think that really hinders the film and im fine with it on the whole i love this movie and im very grateful for the studio and director james wan for taking a leap of faith and really going for it this is easily the most enjoyable film in the dceu the future looks bright,fantasy
i fort was great film good watch all time one of best film seen so far,fantasy
i dont understand all of the terrible reviews they seem to mostly criticize the acting and the plot i enjoyed most of the acting and the cast had some great actors willem defoe temuera morrison and nicole kidman and some not so great actors that i still love dolph lundgren i enjoyed jason momoas performance the plot is standard superhero stuff the only real weakness was the villain manta i had a hard time believing or caring about his character fortunately he was a relatively small part of the moviethe visuals were outstanding the movie moved along briskly and the action scenes were always entertaining the was as good as anything marvel had put out,fantasy
i loved all of the actors that were cast in this movie jason mamoa was fantastic as however the storyline was a bit confusing for some of the dialogue they were talking about characters we havent even met yet as if we are supposed to know who they are im still kind of confused as to why not all atlantians can breath above water but then at the end they were all above water breathing just fine maybe i missed key parts but i was very confused still one of the better dc movies for sure,fantasy
same story different character how could a being that is half human and have from ailanthus be stronger than someone that lived there all their life in atlantis,fantasy
i fear that all of the low scoring viewers have lost their love of adventure and lack the ability to accept a movie for what all movies should be considered as entertainmentescape our every day lives other than the last jedi which is the only movie i could not accept because of its destruction of the lucas universe,fantasy
wow jason momoa is easy on the eyes that alone has brought many people to watch this filmthe action locales and fight sequences are all on pointa few times was i checking my watch and feeling as though it dragged a bitbut worth a rental,fantasy
good film good effects only down fall is its a long film kinda dragged towards the end in my opinion,fantasy
the movie was pretty cheesy not gonna lie arthurs mom just in general for example she had to leave to protect her family and arthurs dad walked to the edge of the pier everyday to see if she would come back and how everyone thought she was dead but surprise surprise she wasnt dead and of course both she and her son both recognized each other immediately when the reunited now ill give it up for some of the fight scenes because they were kind of cool and the crab king was actually cute which i dont really say that often so thats good i guess if i have to sum it up dc was intimidated by the awe that is marvels success panicked and created the build up was really rough with all the exposition and drama didnt really have too much of a personality up until a 4th of the movie just illustrating the kind of cocky herotype main character the box office thinks we want to see and then giving him more of a reckless attitude later on ill also give it up for dcs attempt to keep both roles equal instead of empowering just the female role like most movies nowadays ill end it with this lets just be happy its not justice league,fantasy
when they started playing that terrible version of africa i decided this movie sucked,fantasy
it wasnt very deep for an underwater movie but the action scenes were very well made nothing was surprising very predictable the cgi was done great what really bothers me is how ugly the king is made to be there is no freaking way him and arthur are brothers,fantasy
this storyline was all over the place and took awhile to get to the actual point of the movie,fantasy
any rating i give this movie should come with a massive asterisk because this movie may have broken me a littlei want to say right upfront that this is not a good movie this is far from being a good movie but i implore you to see this right now has provided one of the most fun movie going experience i have had in a whileif you read my 2018 retrospective you will know that this film reminded me of many other films that is one of the things that fascinates me so much about this really this should feel kind of fresh and new given the directors previous work and the less serious tone within the dc movie universe but so many scenes feel ripped from other moviesthe special effects are absolutely incredible throughout the movie the attention to detail with the underwater world makes watching this on the big screen feel rewarding every action sequence in the kingdom of atlantis feels like the exact opposite to the one on wakanda during black panther in that movie often the special effects and action choreography felt like an after thought so that the movie could focus on other things while in they are given the time they deserve to leave an impact having said that the other moments in the film are also polar opposite to black panther where in that movie slow dialogue heavy moments felt like they had real weight here they are usually laughable and not when they mean to bejames wan is a great director and their is no denying that he has had an impact on the horror genre with greats such as saw the conjuring and insidious and his mark will felt on that genre for years but in recently his foray into the action genre has had interesting results there is no doubt that furious 7 was more than a little goofy but with wan has outdone himself none of the character arcs are memorable or interesting the two leads have no chemistry there is no real villain of the movie but there are two side villains and about an hour into the film i lost track of the plot and started laughing uncontrollably for way to longi am seriously finding it difficult to put into words how bizarre this movie is because on paper it sounds almost par for the course with comic book movies but really this is so much more than thati have to recommend checking this film out but as i said earlier i dont recommend it as a good movie just a fun one like a lot of people i hope that wan will return to his horror roots soon and stop dragging patrick wilson into strange action films they both deserve better thanalso they play the pitbulls version of totos africa in this movie right when saw cocreator leigh whannell makes a cameo that might be my favourite moment of 2018 cinema,fantasy
 is yet another dceu movie that manages to catch a fantastic start but gradually declines into a messy generic movie which only exists to appeal to mainstream audiencesthe same old formula has once again been used but this time our hero is and for the first time ever we have an underwater super hero movie i must say the way the managed to portray the underwater world exceeded my expectations as i have not seen anything like it before but unfortunately its one of the high points of this flickthe movie begins like your average disney movie two characters fall in love have a child and they get separated this child is a boy with seemingly unique powers of being able to communicate with sea creaturesfast forward to when hes grown up is your generic character that is slowly transferred into a hero one that is the last hope of stopping the war versus the atlantans and the earth peopleunfortunately i cant really go any further without spoiling the plot theres not really that much to spoil but lets just say you can predict everything that happens in the movie including some of the dialoguethe movie feels one linear one dimensional there is no sense of wonder no atmospheric environment nothing the movie has managed to bring the best cgi within the dceu universe but at the end of the day it just feels like a moviethere is honestly nothing going for this movie it just manages to succeed at not being as bad as some of dcs lowest suicide squad justice league it plays everything safe sticking to the core roots that the audience seems to enjoy and want out of a movie regardless or not if they have seen it a thousand timesthe writing is poor the screenplay is poor the cgi is fantastic the acting is bland and the movie lacks any memorable moments except for the eye candy fight near the end of the movieoverall if youre okay with the same old movie following the same old formula you cant really go wrong with this movie but for someone who is sick and tired of the same stuff over and over again im going to have to give this movie a 410,fantasy
you make it like kid comic movie aqua man is a great character an this could be better movie,fantasy
take nicole kidmen add some crappy effects and even worse story line boom every single dc movie ever imagine taking the russo brothers captive and stick guns to their heads and getting them drunk your get an ok story line then stick it in google translate to german and back again thats the script for someone please buy jason a shirt tom looks like a wax figure the movie stole a number of scenes from others,fantasy
did they forget that all of this was taking place underwater massive laser battles just makes zero sense i have the same problem here as with black panther and that is the tech is just so far advanced that the movies rely too much on it and laser battles under water are just ridiculous i was actually fine with jasons portrayal of but the story line and cgi were just out of place what happened to good old 1 on 1 good vs evil now ever movie has to have multiple villians the whole manta story line was unnecessary and was indestructible in the comics i just dont remember that part and why would underwater beings be weighed done by such outfits capes on land at least made sense long ago but make zero sense in the water i wish movies would go back to using cgi to enhance the story instead of the cgi driving the story,fantasy
put two beautiful people in a film together and a late night cinemax quality performance is what you get minus a poolside sex scene the cheesy humor and substandard special effects didnt do this film any favors the music score is completely out of context this film is worth watching if youre a film student whom needs to know what not to do not everyone able to make a movie should make a movie,fantasy
over the top less in this film would have been more,fantasy
apologies to those who loved this film i thought it was terrible so glad i didnt waste money to see this in the theater tried to watch it at home but found the writing and dialogue to be ridiculous and the special fx unconvincing especially the age reversal on father and the willem dafoe character in the interest of full disclosure though  i walked out of avatar because i thought it was ridiculous and unwatchable as well so take my opinion with a grain of salt if that is your kind of movie,fantasy
with jason momoa being one of the bright spots in the epic failure justice league this movie failed to deliver on many levels a completely predictable storyline a predictable villain that was not very villainessthe movie did have some very good special effects and jason momoa did have several humorous lines and most of the roles were well cast which was the movies only saving grace,fantasy
i maybe one if he few that didnt enjoy this movie and couldnt care less about a sequel,fantasy
nolans batman movies were phenomenal dc warners continues to make flaming piles of garbage visually this movie is awesome everything else is terrible green latern b v s and justice league sucked ww was ok get it together dc take your time marvel is amazing take a step back and figure it out,fantasy
this is a common and quite predictable movie with a poor story,fantasy
 is a floater and we aint talking dead fish were talking 3 dollar bill over here most worthless super hero ever who the hell wants to conquer water its stupid riding a sea horse ugh so the question remains has been converted from a beta male soy boy ninny to a manly man with this movie i guess i dont know is entertaining but the special effects are a bit questionable some of it looks blatantly fake and some of the action sequences were quirky but overall it does have some creative garbage and the action was overall fun the story is predictable just like every one of these dumb  super duper hero movies and the ending was a bit anti climatic the final battle sucked  was aiiight but nothing special,fantasy
this movie has to be one of the most overly cheesy and boring movies ive ever seenthere are excessive jokes and oneliners sprinkled all over this movie some of the scenes look like they were filmed on the set of a power rangers tv show especially the black manta scenes just awful and uninspiringjason momoa is a terrible actor who comes off as a surfer dudebro joker in just about every single scene  when we all know the from the comics tv shows and video games  is portrayed to be more of a serious charismatic person with leadership qualities  all of which jason momoa fails to bring to the table in addition if youre a real fan of the character and have seen the dc animated film justice league throne of atlantis then you may have noticed how significantly different the story isnot sure what the writers producers and director were thinking but this is an epic fail in the storyline department because they decided to basically make a comedian and change major plot points from other reiterations of backstorythe only good thing about this movie was simply just some of the cgi action sequences when fights the trench monsters for examplethe villains orm and black manta are extremely weak orm spends most of the movie talking smack but when it comes down to the epic final showdown he doesnt put up much of a fightblack manta is another major disappointment again if youve read the comics or even played the injustice video games you know black manta is a warrior with some damaging fighting skills and abilities  but again is underutilized and comes off as a weak side villainthese villains should have been much more brutal but unfortunately they were weakskip this movie especially if youre a fan of from the comics video games or animated content youll be disappointed,fantasy
sadly an overrated moviethe story was too predictable and writing of the characters was weak though the visuals were one of the good parts410,fantasy
now that marvels 10year behemoth of its cinematic universe is starting to pay off its becoming more and more obvious that dc is trying desperately to catch up theres no doubt that dc has interesting characters considering how often superman has been rebooted and how successful christopher nolans batman trilogy was even wonder woman 2017 had its great moments despite also feeling derivative influences from movies like thor 2011 and captain america the first avenger 2011 2018 seems to continue this trend despite again having a strong leading character both physically and in backstorylorei will give dc credit for their casting decisions here for decades has been the butt of the joke amongst many superhero aficionados the fact that jason momoa is a badass snarky and overall entertaining actor to watch in the role speaks to their awareness of image management perhaps featuring him in previous films like justice league 2017 also helped to get audiences interested in seeing this superhero in a standalone movie needless to say my interest was piqued and i finally went to see this film knowing little to nothing about i was in for an experiencewhile the movie overall wasnt bad it felt a little too long i think the black manta storyline was a bit distracting especially as a setup for a future sequel after all when theres this huge lord of the rings meets star wars conflict going on there shouldnt be time for these other plotlines ill also say that the plot felt a little derivative of black panther 2018 which only had the advantage of being released earlier in the year there was also a bit of a tron legacy 2010 aesthetic in this movie that i liked i did feel the little mermaid 1989 nod was perhaps a little too obvious thougha jason momoa vehicle crammed full of plot and aesthetics from other films i give 35 stars out of 5,fantasy
im only focusing on the storyline and characters here the special effects and stuff was great acting was bad and there was little character developmentthis movie suffers from the same problem common to many superhero movies these days the hero can be regarded a hero only in the context of the absolutely stupid planpurpose of the villain1 king orm wants to scorch the surface ok but then what what are they going to do with all that land they cant possibly expect to rule it are they planning to sell the surface to the highest alien bidder it would make perfect sense if this was the case only the royalists can even breathe on land 99 of their population cant there is no resource on land that they crave they have absolutely nothing to gain through an invasion and a lot to lose so whats the point2 and just because king orms plan is absolutely ridiculous the hero becomes the hero by stopping him thats the whole story3 now just for a moment imagine a more sensible plan from the bad guy lets say orm only wanted to unite all the clans and become ocean master just so that he can prepare for any possible threat from the above lets say hes using the fearhate for surface dweller only to gain support from the others say he never really planned on scorching the surface if this was the case can we totally vote for arthurbasically arthur is the hero only because the bad guys plan was just ridiculousnow take a look at the characters4 arthur is not really a hero for atlantis he had a little brother down there and he knew it he says he wanted to visit him but this was clearly a lie as he never even tried he finally came only as an enemy when he thought his loved ones were in danger5 now orm on the other hand knows that his brother above was trained by a traitor to take his throne he also knows that arthur wanted to do nothing with atlantis orm says he hated arthur however orm never tries to harm arthur or his father in any way even though he knew arthur could become a threat someday even when arthur comes as an enemy orm still tries to send him back before the combat so that he doesnt have to kill him so which one of them is more honest  honorable6 vulko is a pure traitor he swore to serve the throne but trains the halfbreed to take the throne from the pureblood king for no logical reason he just sits there and lies to the face of his king on a daily basis when orm asks why vulkos reply is just laughable how on earth can he possibly know that arthur would have become a better king than orm would ever be when orm was just a kid he started training arthur when orm was even younger that arthur7 when orm says he had dedicated his whole life to atlantis vulko does not deny that so there is clearly no reason why he would support arthur since the time orm was just a kid unless he wanted to make arthur king based on the queens beliefs why cant he just say that8 if vulko really served the throne as he claimed he could have tried to unite the brothers after the kings death remember that orm had no other family except his brother above vulko doesnt do that but just keeps on believing that arthur must be the king theyre looking for,fantasy
just saw pretty fun the visual effects and cinematography were great the script was just awful also the music cues were way cheesier than i think they meant and when the two leads kissed i literally facepalmed,fantasy
although momoa gives us a good patrick wilson gives us a yawn boring main antagonist its not his fault but the lines hes given are painfully childish and one dimensional although theres improvement compared to other dceu entries childish style writing in some scenes is still one of the main problems in the dceumantas doing a better job as a villain but he didnt exactly drew me in either still more complexity than orm for surenow the films a bit allover the place at times there are a bit too many subplots that are rushed in the the final act and a couple tooobviouscliches we didnt need but didnt hurt us either still as a whole it is more consistent and definitely more enjoyable and well executed than bvs and justice league so its safe to say that dceu is finding what it needsi liked heards mera kidman was also ok as atlana but i found kidmans and mr currys young selves awkward too awkward i most definitely needed a bit deaging effect,fantasy
the stage curtains open well that was impressive there is no shortage of stunning visuals or graphics here is as epic as they come  the quest for a king becomes the story of a hero this one delivers the goodsevery hero has to come from somewhere  story begins with his parents a lighthouse keeper and a queen from the ocean a love that shouldve never happened but was destined to be when soldiers are sent from atlantis to bring home the queen she goes back to save and protect her husband and son years pass by and is doing his part to watch over the waters and the crimes committed within  but when a beautiful stranger appears to him one night asking him to come back and claim the throne that is rightfully his he balks at the idea him a halfbreed and his mother dead however when a display of power comes from the depths of the ocean he knows what he must doat first i was skeptical heading into this one it was nothing like what i expected then i realized that i really didnt know what to expect so i guess it would be more accurate to say that it was better than what i expected usually when you have such striking visuals and cg work it detracts from the overall story not so here it actually adds to it jason momoa really handles himself well in this role he is completely believable and does a fine job of acting  not just a brute force but showed appropriate emotion as welli highly recommend this film for action and superhero enthusiasts be prepared to be blown away by an explosive film that is high on eye candy  with a good story to match one of my favorites of the year,fantasy
i love jason momoa but i cannot get over amber heards horrible wig,fantasy
thus far the studios second great movie wonder woman the first so the rest were teething issuescharacter logic and action meld believably one review i read last year called black manta needless  he is introduced so i feel no sourness the focus is on other plot lines which the focus heads back to,fantasy
never really experienced the side of marvel so the story was for me new the start confirmed the high imdb rating but 45m into the movie i fell alseep more than oncesooooo predictible several dialouges are near embarresing and the ending is well boringyes its pretty yes they made good effects it has an okay story but comeon 1010 is soo wrong on a good day id give it 55and just to confirm i love fantasy marvel adventure movies but damn this i felt was a waste of my time,fantasy
male angle is very handsomeshe is also beautiful acting explosionspecial effectsas alwaysgood good,fantasy
a true visual spectacle fun movie that keeps action to a nonstop viewer eyeonthescreen modeand for all those marvel and dc comparisons  much much better than black panther,fantasy
maybe it is how it is ya know we loved them as kids for the eye candy and the hilariously dumb stories that they werebut then you grow up and realise that it will always be kids watching superhero movies so theyll never make them any cleverer or grownupas in an overall better movie not swear words and sexual stuffdark knight trilogy never existed shoo shoo when all hope was lost i thought they were starting to go somewhere with the release of wonder woman but hey  seems like it will always be the never ending cycle of marvel making their ground with each new release and dc desperately but failingly trying to catch up to them while both their equally toxic and dumb fanbases screw with the film ratings they need to realise that just because a movie gives you goosebumps doesnt necessarily mean that its a good movieabout this movie howeverbad dialogue coupled with bad attempts at comedyover the top cgi low budget video games does it betterextremely bad and clich storyline410 because karathen and black mantadont recommend watching it if you want good dc stories just go watch the animated moviesnow waiting in disappointment for the next flop to be that is shazam,fantasy
i am a marvel fan but this movie was great stunning and amazing underworld and of course jason momoa was super ,fantasy
the most impressive superhero movie so far and i thought it was important enough to add my review given the recent senseless negative commentary which could put some off from enjoying it sooner than later there have been good and mediocre superhero movies over the past few years but nails is right in every category awesome acting awesome story and special effects casting is perfect and locations and scenery that is not cgi is incredible no one watches this movie without knowing that its part of a superhero franchise so i wont make absurd comments about whether its cheesy or cliche it plays the part its supposed to in the movie experience perfectly,fantasy
callmeyourkingsobeit the movieits admittedly overlong because its overstuffed with too many storylines and a long introductory opening sequence that could and should have easily been omitted as there are many betterexecuted flashbacks which are more than enough add to this the fact that the aforementioned opening sequence is filled with cringeinducing moments including those which concern the romantic aspect which is in my opinion the only silly thing that didnt work in the moviethat said the movie is packed with thrilling kinetic and meticulously designed and choreographed action setpieces in which you really can follow the action and the liberated fight sequences buoyed by raucous deluge of dazzling array of visual effects replicating underwater movement and offering exotic creatures and characters outfits that contrast the deep blue sea with splashes of bright colors james wan did a tremendous job creating an underwater world thats a visual feast thats consistently boasting a visual feast for the eyes i enjoyed the outofwater action sequences more they are better and more masterfully designed than those that take place underwater but nothing can compete with the stunning freeflowing underwater action scenes from the visual standpointaside from furious 7 wans filmography is strictly horror related having launched franchises in his own right with saw and the conjuring here we can see that he still uses his background in horror to deliver some moments that have shocking and surprising value and they are quite effectiveits not hard to tell that the entire cast and crew went all out their dedication does not go unnoticed all the cast did their best to give a strong comeback considering that most of them once had a quite promising and auspicious career as for jason momoa he really shines as the titular superhero his physical appearance suits the badass character that the dceu wanted to make from the getgo he looks and fights as if he is a wwe superstar amber heard is great and the chemistry between her indiana jonesian character mera and momoas is electric and gripping they make an awesome dynamic duo and their sugary cheerful relationship made up for the nauseating saccharine romance of tom curry and queen atlannathe two villains have quite compelling background and convincing motives and each ones subplot never overshadows the others also patrick wilson and yahya abdulmateen ii are pretty good is an extremely cool and badass epic fantasy adventure of cheesiness its decidedly a step in the right direction for dc i still think wonder woman is the best movie in their extended universe so far but is now my personal favorite810,fantasy
i waited so long to watch this movie because i honestly thought it was going to be bad is probably most peoples least favorite dc character but they really did him justice the script is well written and the acting is great this movie was much better than expected,fantasy
there are only two good points momoa was a good cast choice and there was some decent fight choreography in some parts the rest far outweighs bad dialogue crappy costumes poor story bad soundtrack too much cgi etc one of the worst films ive seen in a loooooong time maybe they can pull a ragnarok and give him a good sequelim sorry jason they let you down,fantasy
im surprised on how this movie is still in theaters but can still see this at home this marks the longest movie i have seen from 2018 clocking in at 2 hrs and 23 min thats double the time averages were like 1 hr 35 min and thats your typical horror movie but that is different is not a horror movie you got action adventure and scifi all in one the actions on land and underwater if you dont like that then youre in the wrong place,fantasy
dc never learn do they well baby steps they thought that the success of wooden woman would do the trick and they were right clearly there arent enough pirates in the world to show that making bad movies is bad for businessthe first thing id like to say is that this movie is extremely dumb painfully clinically not gravity level not prometheus or even martian it is logan level of dumb the absolute abyss it is technically impossible to watch this movie and think rationally so the only survivors either have their brains disabled by default or had to luckily unlike logan  this movie is more like avatar its probably the most visual since avatar yes both nibber panther and infinity quip were stunning but not really visual the difference is like a game with good graphics and subnautica this makes more or less easy to swallow indeed if you do not think about what you are watching  this is a fancy popcornmuncher perhaps even worthy of going to some imaxanother very important feature about this movie  is that unlike nibber panther and wooden woman or even captain feminist  this movie doesnt seem to have a deep agenda sure there are a few allusions and suggestions but id hardly compare it to the modern world because we dont have a karathen and any attempt to replicate such a scenario for politics would hardly be done in cgi agenda propaganda the things that pollute martian wooden woman nibber panther zootopia frozen  they are the first and foremost things that inhibit the suspension of disbelief because you are almost ready to give in when the writers remind you that hey this is kinda relatable dontcha think the same goes for pretentiousness logan the shape of water  when movies actively try to pretend to be something that also tends to itch for people who have problems turning their brains off and thats the thing  doesnt have any of that its a perfect example of a visually brilliant sort of fun filled with action superhero flick for that  i can sort of agree that its worth 610 its nowhere near the first avengers its not half as thrilling as the dark knight and it doesnt even begin to scrape the surface of the watchmen these movies were first of all whole movies with superheroes and cgi being sort of a background and thats what truly deserves the peaks of the rating isnt insightful it doesnt show anything new in fact its plot is even more stupid and painful than logan its characters  a copypasta from wooden woman most of the memorable scenes have a blue steel face in them just like wooden womansorry galya gadot a model aint an actress so you cant really feel the characters you dont feel anything towards them there is no danger no real drama everything is as artificial as superficial as it could be nichole kidman washed up ashore well lets get busy she was hiding well but how does learn to do things oh apparently he is trained already hes fighting the bad guy oh well skip that part then theres some desert quipping property damage in actually better parts of the world then they go where they need to go do things they need to do chop in a cgi battle and voila  that theres a movie ive watched a fullspoiler review of this movie before watching so if you consider this summary a spoiler i feel sorry for you someone has tothe villains make lex luthor look good i guess patrick wilson signed up just because he was told theres an annabelle cameo that nibber with his father that whole scene makes martha look painless there are two absolutely clearly and unmistakably ahole guys one of them is allowed to live then he gets a chance for revenge then he also lives okay i am a racist but casting him as a black manta after black panther seriously writers you make the world racist you do either way the perpetual survival of this absolutely elevel villain that makes malekith and ronan look impressiveand thats saying a lot  doesnt help this movie it only helps to establish an even more stupid sequelfor all intents and purposes an effort shouldve been made to turn into the ocean master because clearly there havent been any for a while and its not like anyone but momoa can do that ocean master that resounds thats somehow more meaningful than starlord thats a seaman joke bait good for a movie title i suppose people wouldnt have 15th of a brain to figure out what is the movie about otherwise but for the movie to end with him accepting the name a moniker given by hell knows whom when he clearly has a title again i suppose the target audience wouldnt understand what ocean master stands forspeaking of target audience i guess the shareholders at dc figured that dc has only one set of powers  the asman so no matter who that is  cyborg batman wooden woman  all heroes need to be some sort of bulletproof need to be crushed into buildings and stuff need to occasionally bleed need to fly and be super fast sure doesnt fly or run but somehow the only identifier that the movie sort of happened underwater  was the visual background otherwise its absolutely 101 no different from  avengers or guardians of the galaxy people talk things fly sounds are heard you know bullets battles physics and all that so yes is about as original as drax okay scratch that drax is a memelord and an actually good character is just jason momoa and his enemy is just patrick wilsonmaybe in a few years  dc would learn to flesh out their characters plots to imagine heroes with more abilities than virtual invulnerability and lasers out of their eyes maybe origin stories would have some moments where the audience would feel something for their heroes when heroes do actually incredible things instead of pulling the sword from the stone until then  seaman is a decent movie to download worthy of some popcorn and imax but its not something to write home about people who praise it clearly have abyssbottom low expectations for dc movies and in dceu ignoring the dark knight trilogy  yes is definitely the best movie so far sadly a hero in town is only a commoner in a city and most people live in cities,fantasy
was hoping for much more unfortunately the trailer was pretty much the movie not enough one liners for methats what makes these movies so watchable normally was ok but not much more,fantasy
entertaining enough to see but clearly bellow average for the genre i love this type of action movie fantasy and this one though enjoyable didnt meet my standards at all it was okay there are great movies within this line of story superheroes and this one isnt as funny as exciting nor as beautiful nicole kidman  i admire you as a woman that fights for women rights and i think you are beautiful please stop freezing your face however you do it it doesnt move and that doesnt favor you,fantasy
overhyped and badly made i usually dont write reviews but i feel i must take out my frustration here the 7210 rating made me watch it waste my 2 hours and i might not trust imdb againhumour was below average action sequences were boring and the scenes would just cut off and not merge into one another,fantasy
clearly wb hasnt done a great job planing dceus movies and marvel is better on the big picture laying out the whole plan for the grand world view i think maybe this is why lots of people think is the best dceu moive personally i dont think is a great movie definitely far from the best except the vfxif you compare with bvs or watchmen youll find that this story is like a childrens fairytale it has no reflection on our reality it just tells a hero becomes the hero defeats the villain and finds the love one it has no soulof course the vfx is epic but we already have an avatar what we need now is a great story not overproductions,fantasy
i cant belive how sneery a kind of movies we have here evrything in this movie was crap costoms story charachterstools weapons  it could be much acceptable in animation creativity is zero i would like to highlight some fails which i belive it should not be messed in such huge movie coming from a large production such as marvelsfail 1 atlanna falls in love with the 1st man she met on land and for a long times they couldnt find her untill she gave arthurwhat about he stupid uniformfail 2 king orm knew that vulko trained arthur since childhood but he left him do it for long years and wanted to surprice vulko at the end of the movie was this indian sensefail 3 the guards looks so ugly and not compatible with the ocean creatures its robots come on a little babygirl can do better imagination for such guards and customs especially the red ray weaponfail 4 arthur  the story hero caould lift a submarine easily from the deep ocean to the surface but it was very difficult for him to fight a metal ugly robot  mantafail 5 when king orm met the green freaking king to convince him to do war on land people that king came to me king orm without guards weapons and brings his wife and daughter with him is this an act of a kingsfail 6 if these creatures caould see underwater with supernatural powers why they have lights in their jets camps and everywherefail 7 what is the purpose of sharks riding when they can swim faster than it its like monkeys riding horses in planet of the apes patheticfinally remember we have to maintain the oceans cleanliness so the aqua people dont get mad and dround the lands,fantasy
the movie is good and the universe hava a great potential but the script was so generic and obvious that makes this movie a good opcin for a afternoon movie and far from a epic and greatsorry it was delivered for the wrong hands maybe a great director and better producers could save from the mediocrity,fantasy
the history of has been established in other marvel movies so rewriting the past seems silly the possibility of of a great past is everywhere but the writers wanted to toss all this away and write something that would sillyi would have rather waited for dvd,fantasy
the cgi the characters the scenario that was so lame  cant believe they could find money and time to make this what a waste,fantasy
so so so disappointed with the reviews on here a complete joke of a film very very painful to watch the cgi is terrible the acting has you face palming and black mantis is basically a awful power ranger i was a massive fan of man of steal but since then dc has got it wrong over and over would have left the cinema on multiple occasion on this film it was tragic ps the girl giving the red head the pinocchio book is beyond cringe worthy,fantasy
tbh the only thing that deserve rating is the effects most scenes were pretty ridiculous,fantasy
the screenplay is formulaic you will have that feeling of i heard and seen all of this before in other dc movies think aquathor  avatar  john carter  raiders of the lost ark  king arthur and men with tight hair buns they blew the whole film budget on cgi and spent a pence on the writersseriously was it necessary to do a cgi sunrise and sunset too no one had a spare camera drone to fly over the lighthouse during a real sunset and oh poor nichole she has won five golden globe awards two emmy awards a british academy film award and an academy award she is the first australian actress to win the academy award for best actress and they put her in a fish costume with a lobster claw egadsgreat cast but poor execution and poor acting performances this film will not age well worse of all i really love the actors nichole kidman jason momoa and the lovely amber heard6 out of 10 from me,fantasy
ok visuals are nice especially in the second half of the movie but what is it with the teatrical overacting that was unwatchable the black villain costume that looks like alpha 5 robot from power rangers was beyond stupid music was really good this movie is almost unwatchable but i made it to the end,fantasy
thought this film was a poor attempt to make up for not developing the character prejustice league at times it felt it was jumping on the coattails of thor ragnarok success clutching for quick laughs and music to push the story forward mimicking scene from fifth element and even at one point it felt like i was watching powerrangerssome liked this i guess but it came across to me desperate to impress more cringe then classy in its cheesy oneliners and just over complicated basically felt rushed into a climatic end with no true build up over a number of good films before hand so i really didnt care how it ended,fantasy
its about as cliched as they get a bit of karate kid in here ill teach you this move when youre ready then he uses the move in the end instead of horses under the sea they use seahorses instead of jets they use sharks the battle under the sea is an exact replica of the battle above its you heroic movie that were used to but substituted for the oceani like this movie for the special effects a bit of the story but for anyone wanting to really find a new superhero movie sigh it falls short instead of on land its your basic movie in the seabut it was enjoyable,fantasy
this movie is not like what i expected the story is not interesting  i think wonder woman still the best dc movie ,fantasy
i really liked the special effects besides that nothing special i dont know why dc does such an awful job on finding good scripts and not depending on pop music or some mediocore jokes and plz stop with the fake ratings ty,fantasy
super expensive movie with super laughable cgi for a movie all about the cgi it is pretty unexplainable always a shame to see a good cast in a pretty lame movie the only redeeming quality is the sheer goofiness of it allpossible explanationmoney laundering scheme,fantasy
visually  looked awesome and worked oncostumes  weak barely fit some characters cheesyacting  weak writing was cheesyfighting scenes  pretty decent and somethings popped out as uniquestoryline  rushed all over the placeoverall movie was weak and made me feel like i wasted almost 3 hours of my life,fantasy
this move just overrated only jason mamoa that i like,fantasy
i have so many mixed feelings because is honestly a complete farce but not in a miserable way like justice league but in an actually funny way like grown men investing 160 million into a goofy saturday morning cartoon about magical sea people with both insanely creative environments and occasionally atrocious green screen and editing and it takes itself super super cereal except when jason momoa tries to make jokes which are pathetic but then because theyre pathetic theyre funny and then this obnoxiously gigantic crab destroys everything and im just left speechless because this is the most ridiculous thing ive seen in a long time,fantasy
visually nice but the good ends there wan bungles this very poor script into 2 hours of uneven all over the place nonsense impressively uncohesive the whole thing feels like a series of trailer moments horrible dialog heard is terrible and drags the movie down further there are fun sequences for sure but the movie cant get out of its own way  it knows how corny it is but cant seem to fully accept it the score is generic and painfully obvious would have rather had an and lighthouse dad movie more lowest common denominator global schlock,fantasy
dc has finally decided not to take its filmmaking endeavors too seriously though the film does not follow the successful marvel recipe of laughs and explosions it still manages to entertain by combining different genres the atlantis scenes remind a space opera the plot a quest for the kings trident is a successful combinations of lord of the rings and on occasion indiana jones movies how can these different genres be combined all one needs is an inventive and intelligent directoroverall this is a very entertaining movie and compared to all other dc titles it clearly stands out as their finest yet up there with wonder woman and in my opinion this one is even better mr wan proves he is a top tier director as he successfully combines different cinematic elements with seamless gracein his extremely apt hands is a long and fun journey that has nothing to do with the terrible and gloomy dc universe as captured in the snyder moviesi had given up in dc i thought wonder woman was the fortunate mistake changes the expectations it seems there may be some hope for dcs cinematic future after allon a final note the cast is generally good momoa carries the movie successfully which to me was a surprise after his abysmal performance in conan the only big mistake of the movie is that it lacks a convincing villain wilson was clearly miscast i imagine under the misapprehension that the actor playing the part should slightly remind us of his mother a bulkier and meaner looking actor would make the rivalry between him and momoa more interestingbut at the end of the day does it really matter that much nobody expects to lose still next time please try not to have momoa trade punches with remi malekin conclusion even if you are not thrilled you will be entertained dcs is a nicely structured actionscififantasyadventure  with impressive visuals excellent direction and a sense of originality,fantasy
the movie have some light movement that is not good part of movie specially the part of the and princess that just too light and sometime childish too much has some good action also but the point of dialogue and being the hero first is just irritating i like it but not that level as everyone saying,fantasy
the movie despite of having a running time of 2 12 hr never seems boring or dull maybe because of its energetic tone tight screenplay great cgi decent characters and predictable story linethe whole movie heavily rely on cgi but compared to other dceu movies the cgi is extraordinary it presents the depth of kingdom of atlantis in a very fascinating waythe direction and screenplay is what makes this movie exceptionally decent the performances are fine momoa playing arthur seems active and heavy amber playing princess mera is beautiful as well as badass and supporting cast is satisfactoryoverall its a visual effects treat and superhero action adventure equally toppledit deserves 810,fantasy
the movie started excellent and i really liked the intro of the storythen the submarine scene pffff lets pretend for a minute that is possible for an hostile force to actually make a commando strike which is not and take possession of a russian nuclear submarine and mister aqua jumps in the story to save the day all good witch problems that destroyed the movie for me  special commando guy scared behind a door after fighting a submarine full of russians successfully thats just stupid the 40mm grenade explodes in a enclosed environment and the two bad black guys are just fine its like not a chance in hell that happens throwing half a torpedo on the ground and nothing happensthere have been many other mistakes in just a few minutes but i tried to keep a my observation count at 3  and all this mistakes takes you out of the movie as there is to much fantasy in the movie and any law of physics are just nonexistent a good movie will anchor it self to a type of reality but here they decided to go with fantasy and i understand its a superhero movie but superhero or not there are things that just do not work,fantasy
i cant not describe how fun was this popcorn extravaganza james wann you are the king,fantasy
best visual effects ever seen in my life  good story  good characters  best movie for enjoying alone or with your family,fantasy
is this black panther on reverse the outsider comes to be king and actually stays kingthe plot is horrible and there are too many special effects too many lights that dont make any sense too much technology that doesnt make any senseits great the way the characters move under water those efffects are greatsome fights are awesome but it all seems exagerated they could make these movies way more realisticits good to see once but thats all,fantasy
 is just the next comic book hero movie to come along that nobody in particular asked for part of the underwhelming dc universe its a surprise that this movie was released based on the bad reviews of so many of the dc universe cannon it was a strange decision to release the justice league movie which was an ensemble cast before each of the individual characters had their own movies releasedback to the basic story is that mother nicole kidman is cast out of her underwater kingdom and is taken in by a lighthouse keeper played by temuera morrison fast forward and is born and his mother is dragged away by some angry aquaworld police in space uniforms this sets the tone for the movie as it seems that any time we have any relative quiet something explodes this a repeated theme throughout which begins to seem laughable on repetition another odd motif is the use of shouting not people shouting in arguments using actual words just aaaaaaaaaarrrgggghhh for no real reason trust me this happens although this is supposed to be an underwater story it really looks like a scifi set in space with lazers space ships and space suits at one point it actually looks like tron legacy and even sounds like the tron legacy soundtrack this cant have been a mistakeas for the actual storyline its quite hard to keep up as it seems to bounce around quite a bit there is a subplot about an evil pirate who is out for revenge against called manta but he should really be called frog helmet due to his ridiculous costume watching the movie you basically forget he exists until booom another explosion and there he is i warned you about the boomsdespite a few well known faces the acting is quite poor is case in point he seems to chew his words and it looks like the only reason he got the role was his looks his jokes and pretty much all of the jokes in the movie fall flatsome of the visuals are impressive but its a 95 cgi movie and despite the sheer amount of onscreen action its neither engaging or exciting its a very zach snyder type of movie at times dark visuals with slow mo but a very hollow experienceyou could easily stick this on to watch while you tidy your house but i doubt that it would be enough to draw you in to make you give up the houseworkit can be interesting visually at times but with a messy script zero emotional content sub par acting and very little to remember after still you will have managed to complete over two hours worth of housework with some flashing lights and loud noises for company,fantasy
after seeing this move and reading some of these reviews all i can say is people are idiots it is so obvious that some people dont like these kind of movies there is either too much action or they just dont understand themso dont go and see them go and watch something slower and boring something easier to follow its as simple as that,fantasy
i just saw i liked it yes he made a huge mistake in not showing mercy to that pirate in the beginning but it becomes apparent he had a chip on his shoulder because he thought his mother was dead and by the end of the movie hes learned to show mercy its like half scifi and half medieval  ancient greek with some game of thrones elements and it has some nice visuals i also love that his parents reunite at the end this is what a dc movie should be action drama and hope not that darkity dark dark nonsense zack snyder was pushing also mera is a well developed character here this is probably the best depiction of mera ive seen,fantasy
let us say  aliens start dumping wastes into earth  will we be quite or do something to let them know it is wrong now imagine  a human prevents taking action against aliens  because he was brought up by an alien this is the summary of whole movie the hero doesnt give any suggestions on these or blames humans  while so called villian  tries to protect his people,fantasy
 is visual spectacle with simple plot where you dont have to think a lotit has everything from comedyromancelove jam packed action and a nice background scoreas movie goes on you get to know who iswhat is atlantis and what actual story isperformance of every actor is good as per the characterscostumes are very much comic book acurateactions scenes are badass with so many amazing visulas from the first scene till the climax you didntnt get bored direction of james wan is mind blowing with wonderful cgi specially in mariana trench scene which i 100 guarantees will blow you away james wan manages to balance the ship thats overcrowded with characters and subplots to create a smooth sailing adventure thats awesome to look at,fantasy
i was so looking forward to this but was really disappointed i like all the actors but i just thought it was less than i was expecting,fantasy
i think we need to take a step back and look at how the comics portray he shown as a magical creature who can talk to fish and ride them like surfboards and whatever  and surely the people behind this film would want to make as close to the comics as possible however such a character would be a joke compared to the dark brooding universe dc typically is associated with it would be too silly to have such a character and try to somehow make him as cool as batman instead the filmmakers tried to make this a cheesy as possible and it works its has similarities to corny childrens cartoons and doesnt take itself seriously its refreshing to see a lighthearted film like this and i really recommend it  just dont expect something as dark and deep as batman,fantasy
the movie is waaay too long i could last half and hour less and show the essentials is the first time i saw mi phone at a cinema i have to admit is way better than justice league or batman vs superman but even that is not a good movie,fantasy
i was nervous about going to this movie as multiple dc movies have left me disappointed this movie however went back to the origin story of the hero like wonder woman and it was a fun adventure the underwater world was pretty neat and is best seen on the big screen i felt the big bads were a bit disappointing and the plot was really predictable but it was still entertaining and a decent superhero movie it was cool to see a different type of superhero in jason momoa,fantasy
did i enjoy the film yes it was a very enjoyable one maybe just behind wonder woman the action was enjoyable the story was decent though some bits could of been done without the main issue i had was with dolfs cgi hair under the water it just seemed odd compared to others like supermans cover tash you will see what i mean when you watch the film amber heard was fantastic as was jason mamoa the supporting cast also did a stella job bar the main villain who i thought lacked something though he tried to be menacing and cold i just didnt fear him as the big bad,fantasy
cool action scenes and visual effects but sometime too much cgi didnt give me any reason to care about any of the underwater world,fantasy
movie goes on and on you start feeling cringy and hope it all ends with usual king movie cliches no depth in characters love story is quite mechanical,fantasy
more dumb than fun but you cant quite ignore the fun also visually entertaining and jason momoa did great reminds me so much of thor ragnarok 2017,fantasy
mamoa does a decent job but theres a lot of cheesy dialogue that put me off in this still lots of special effectscgi come to the rescue in making this a decent watch,fantasy
having been let down by dceu again and again wonder woman being the exception i had no real desire to sit through the trailers didnt impress me and even the best cgi in the world was never a draw for me either so i put on the back burner before finally sitting down to watch it with the lowest of expectations and i ended up loving every minute of it because it was fun and epic with an actual fully fleshed out story all the way throughis it up there with the absolute best of the mcu titles not quite but its better than more than a few of them and for the dceu its a huge step in the right direction more in tone with wonder woman and not all gloomy and awful like the other films,fantasy
jason is pretty to look at that part was a given after following his roles for a few years but what surprised me was the fun and humor spread throughout the movie was just plan cool both on land and in the water i adored nicole kidmans part as well starting with the goldfish eating and cute dog scene i went with a group of 13 ladies the first time my husband didnt want to listen to the banter of that and he and i went the following week after i promised him that i thought he would like it it sort of reminded me of starwars under water with all the cool battle creatures and weapons throughout and of course an uber bad guy dressed in all black we really didnt understand why jason kept putting his shirt on all the time i mean hes going to jump in the water why so many clothes a very enjoyable time at the movies,fantasy
dc may never admit it but has too much in common with taika waititis thor ragnarok the overpowered protagonist destined to be king  although he does not wish to rule a realm that mixes mysticism and technology  needs to dethrone a sibling with expansionist ideas aided by a female warrior  supermodel way more mature than him having strong colors and 80s inspired soundtrack as a backdrop there are no great performances but the cast works the script well enough and the film amuses the audience standin beside wonder woman as a enterteinment far superior to batman v sperman or justice league although thats something not really that hard to achieve,fantasy
srkleyici senaryosu keyifli bir izlenim sunuyor dc de gelisme var,fantasy
movie looks good nice cgi effects but other than that it is crap,fantasy
get rid of amber heard her mera character sucks and also the movie would be 909092340923948 times better without her stale acting,fantasy
preface i love dc marvel is good but i love the characters of dc i love the dark serious tones and the emotional depth of the backstories bvs ultimate edition is my favorite dc movie i loved justice league ending needed more work man of steel was far too long but good and wonder woman was indeed phenomenalreview cmon guys this movie is cheesy silly overly flamboyant and utterly forgettable its most like watching a highbudget episode of the power rangers the main villain literally says call me black manta and wears an oversized helmet looking like a power rangers or oldschool godzilla villian the dialogue is cringy in many places the atlantians are completely shallow every villian is cheesy call me ocean master the plot is disjointed and aloof this movie sucks i struggled to get through it and i will not watch it again it is predictable in every senseoh and i think we can see that jason momoa is a great secondary actor but definitely cannot lead a feature filmredeeming pointsi wanted to love this movie just because i love dc much more than marvel but i just dont the good parts are that the cgi is much better than supermans mustache in justice league in fact the cgilive action mix for both woman fights are nearly seemless and very enjoyable the rooftop running sequence was also very well done the movie is also very colorful not always a good thing  see ocean masters costumetldranything over 7 stars is likely a paid review or a dc superfanboy or a james wan fanboy honest dc fans will have to admit this is a low point bring back zack snyder,fantasy
to be honest this is the first time ever i am impressed with dcs cinematography story delivery and plot what more i can say it takes you to a very creative adventure with bit of almost everything a thousand times better than wonder woman 2017 crapps wonder woman 2017 just felt like an absolute copy of captain america the first avenger 2011,fantasy
people who complain about the cheesy dialogue and missing story often say things like this is for children or this is like a cartoon the thing is children shows like peppa pig i watch it with my 3 years old nephew or ladybug i watch it with my 6 years old niece are hundred million times more mature and more suspenseful than the average superhero movie not to mention that the many animation movies out there have some of the best storytelling you can find nowadays so why hollywood why does it have to be so  dumb i dont get it im a writer myself how hard can it be to write some good dialogues i was never a dc fan but i always thought the dc universe would be more mature and darker maybe the whole atmosphere is darker but sure the stories arent more matureso talking about i like the character and the actor the movie was not terrible but it was like 99 cgi even the hair in the water was animated some superhero things happened there were a lot of fights going on and yeah  he became the king of atlantis honestly i dont even know why im writing this review i just wonder why hollywood cannot make a blockbuster movie with a good and intriguing story do good stories dont sell anymore its just sad,fantasy
i read too many reviews that get way too technicalhellomost movies are over the top and unrealistic youre missing the point if thats what your worried about if you are looking for a fun action packed movie this is it this movie was funny had action and was just down right beautiful to watch i cant wait for it to come out of theaters to buy it and watch over and over too many of these comic book movies have long drawn out stories that i spend most my time yelling get to your point not this one it flowed with out boring parts or that feeling of being lost because you havent read the comics i could go on and on but the point isif you are looking for a good movie that sucks you in and you spend 2 hrs forgetting all the craziness that is most of our lives this is it i hope you enjoy it as much as my kids and i did,fantasy
while i will say the special effects were great there were a hell of a lot of problems with it to start with if they were going to use black matnta they should have expanded his role or hinted that he would be in the next one not just for a smaller part of the movie the movie also did not stick to the comic book as his parents were dead or at least his mother was by the time he was king of atlantis the biggest mistake was casting while mamoa was comical he looked nothing to the part they should have switched he as orm and wilson as forget the think outside the box crap all i know i had enough and will pass on any up coming sequel,fantasy
such an awesome moviestunning graphics and thrilling story,fantasy
i think something that goes missed in this film is the simple truth that humans are a threat to the seas as we speak an island twice the size of texas lingers in the pacific made completely of plastic over 17 million tons of plastic we all can do our part illegal fishing practices in japan and china go unwatered this movie although only spending maybe 34 scenes talking about this did a great job in my eyes of letting people know whats going on fantasy or nonfiction,fantasy
once home to the most advanced civilization on earth the city of atlantis is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the powerhungry king orm with a vast army at his disposal orm plans to conquer the remaining oceanic people  and then the surface world standing in his way is orms halfhuman halfatlantean brother and true heir to the throne with help from royal counselor vulko must retrieve the legendary trident of atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deep credit googleim not a fan of dc films for the most part but i accepted my friends invitation to go see this in theatres it looks great its visually stunning and wellacted but its a bit of a tedious experience it runs about 20 minutes too long and the pacing is highly inconsistent dont get me wrong there is a lot of action but even when its throwing all that action in your face its never truly exciting i prefer marvel films because they know how to properly balance everything the acting definitely cant be faulted jason momoa is a very good hes got charisma to spare and was the main reason i was able to tolerate sitting in the theatre for as long as i did amber heard oozes sex appeal and does a great job as mera nicole kidman is always a treat to watch and this time is no different the always dependable willem dafoe is excellent as mentor my only gripe is patrick wilsons performance he was a dull villain in my opinion it was also great to see dolph lundgren have a decent part in a major film once againthis movie is not horrible but its not something im ever going to go out of my way to see again either it did well at the box office and ive read a sequel is in development hopefully the sequel is more entertaining jason momoa deserves it610,fantasy
i enjoy superhero movies but this one is just riddled with cheesy oneliners and forced humour it feels like the dialogue was written by someone who was paid to write a film they had no passion about theres a particular scene toward the end which is just so weak and awkward that i just had to laugh at it the visuals were stunning but that isnt enough for me to have a positive experience of this film i would not go see this again generic and boring,fantasy
its fun and like a copy and paste of power rangers with a higher budget and more visual effectspower rangers had a better storyline though is totally forgettable,fantasy
we enjoyed this treat of a movie a lot more than we thought we would i had no expectations beyond seeing lucious actors but holy wah fun fabulous trips into incredible dreamscapes it was truly a delightful colorful exciting movie,fantasy
it had good action and really good effects but it was way too long and ocean master was a generic villian and black manta was way better written and would have been a way better villain for the moviejason momoa is a fine actor but there is no chemistry between him and mera but i thought it was fine cut out like half an hour and it would get 7510,fantasy
i saw it the first day it came out i was so excited to see it so i was surprised and a little disappointed when i fell asleep twice i wondered will it ever end the same scenes keep repeating themselves over and over lost a lot of points when in the middle of a prescheduled public colosseumstyle showdown with the bad guy the girl encouraged him to abandon the fight and he accepted and ran away like a wuss whata lot of the movie was quantity over quality cheesy and poor effectsjason momoa obviously is smokin hot and exponentially so once he turns into and he is a great actor and carried the movieit is visible that he has difficulty doing love scenes since he is so loyal to his reallife wife which is precious in its own way,fantasy
the action sequences and production design in are phenomenal there is levity and this time dc learned form marvel that one shouldnt take a comic book too seriouslynone of that is enough to fully save from its clunking script and laughable melodrama i will become the ocean master,fantasy
it includes some of the most amazing cgi ever seen in a film and some gorgeous shots,fantasy
my wife suggested we should watch this watching this fil was like a bad dream like having two mortgages on your house or root canal without anesthetic never again,fantasy
it was a very enjoyable good action good villain black manta good effects and a bit too long,fantasy
amazing movie got everything you looking for in a hero movie is epic not stop action for two hours in many chapters bring me in years with epicness poses and cinematographymany people in this page says bad things but is just lies because the movie and the billions of dollars this movie won say another thingpeople complain about the script seriously is just a commercial superhero moviewhat you want  this people is pay for put that negative reviewsthrust me is a good movie for just entertainment,fantasy
this is well over hyped weak script plot seemed really forced and predictable action scenes were exactly what i expected with a dc movie ie no explanation of powers everyone can survive any fightpain etc there is a scene where one of the bad guys shoots a laser into a giant rock cliff and completely explodes it into little piecesthat same laser hits and he gets knocked down and is fighting 2 seconds laterdc  we need a scale of powers what is their limit how did they get them what cancant they survivesomething anything not everyone reads the comics its a 2 hour movieyou have the time to explain these thingsoverall skip unless you are insanely bored and need to kill 2 hours and some brain cells,fantasy
critics will definitely have a lot to criticize but what do they know they focus on the technicalities while i the viewer focus only on one thing did i enjoy the movie the answer is yes i absolutely enjoyed the movie its lighthearted which cant really be said for the other dc movies other than the disastrous justice league movie that tried and failed so hard to have some funny moments its action packed which a superhero movie should be and yes its full of cgi what do you expect to get a bunch of actors and film deep under the ocean to train hundreds of sea creatures to act and let people ride them the important thing is that its beautifully done,fantasy
a movie that dont really bring anything special or new to the tabel but it is still a really entertaining movie and its dynamic camera movements will bring pretty much anyone to their seats during its intense action setpieces i found that some of the dialog brought me to the brink of cringing but but the amazing cast really does what it can to help and make it more easy to watch patrik wilson should get extra notice since he probably had the hardest time with a very weak script but personally i think he does an amazing job and you can really tell how much fun he allows him self to have during filming,fantasy
the dialogue is weak manta looks like a villain from the mighty morphing power rangers and its just so cheesy im reviewing to help bring the rating down where it belongs less people should suffer through this movie expecting something awesome jason mamoa was great though,fantasy
the origin story of wasdramatic pauselukewarm no flat tepid too reliant on computerdriven effects lacking in logic overlong my bottom line is that it was a fine movie one that doesnt hinder dcs continuing effort to make movies it does feature some strong performances momoa heard kidman wilson but theres way too many myths and legends crammed in in fact there were times when i felt like i was watching an indiana jones movie than a superhero movie there were more maguffins in this movie than there were human actors also while one certainly must suspend ones disbelief for these movies its counterintuitive to proclaim certain rules for a new to the audience setting and then either ignore those rules or break them outright its also not a good idea for a hero or heroine to forget they have certain abilities until the plot says its time to wrap up the scene and lets try to ignore the cliches while were at it but all in all ill give it a b for effort,fantasy
cmon guys why so many of you are putting 110 or 210  i understand that you might be marvel fanboys but be real and put an objective score the movie was entertaining and well made thats what such movies all about at least the majority of them some say that there were cliches and it was predictable well yeah what did you expect hollywood to come up with a new formula with that movie in particular cmon be real and stop acting like youre professional critics and youre getting paid to bash on some movies once again  it was a good well made entertaining movie period,fantasy
i mostly watched it for the special effects and action the story was average if you want to pass time without thinking too much you will enjoy this movie,fantasy
dc are finally getting back on their feet again and are starting to produce some decent titles and the latest installment is no exception is the embodiment of a superhero movie buffed up protagonist lots of special effects plenty of fisticuffs and most importantly very predictable jason momoas incredible body more shirtless scenes were needed mostly distracted from some very cliched scenes where dialogue was so predictable i felt like id already seen the movie in fact all the original content was used in the trailer and the rest of the film felt like obligatory filler that being said the filler was pretty good and theres a reason why super hero films are so popular however couldnt deliver on any of the novel elements that made wonder woman so good so i was left a little wanting but also momoas abs so yeah,fantasy
i read a bad review and only went because there was nothing else that looked promisingim glad i went because i enjoyed it a lotthe plot was easy to follow and flowed smoothlythe cgi was greata couple of the lines could have been delivered slightly betterbut it was enjoyable anywaymy girlfriend liked it too and she normally doesnt like action moviesshe liked the queen nicole kidman princess mera and the romantic bits of the movieignore the negative reviews if youre on the fence about this one its highly recommended,fantasy
just another heroes bore for a more or less braindead audience some nice cgi yes but the story provided stinks like overripe cheese forgotten somewhere in the dephts of your fridge,fantasy
very good effort there is a lot they cant do better but for the lovers of comic book it was a very good movie,fantasy
i dont consider myself a fan boy so i cant speak to anything that really relates to the accuracy of any character or storyline that said i went in with really no low  expectations to speak of my wife talked me into seeing the movie something about jason mamoa  meanwhile now at the theatremy wife was thoroughly enjoying the move as i was along for the ride i figured i might as well just sit back and enjoy which i did ,fantasy
this movie was great and anticipated since 2005 i am so glad this movie was done and i love the way it was done the story is very good and needed to be told,fantasy
this movie yells action moviesuperhero movie and all the cliches you can think of but it is definitely a great addition to the dc universe james wan did a great job filming this movie as it showed and created a world atlantis that is just appealing interesting and charismatic leads and mera even the supporting cast villains and extras were all great additions to the movie the pacing does take time as it is a 2 hour movie but keeps the fun in it it contains nice cinematography as it shows a world for us to embrace the action is a definite plus to the film as it had great one shot pieces or long set pieces that are effective and appealing it has some difficulty securing everything it has so the movie can feel quite congested but overall a fun ride a big 8 out of 10 and a good job to dc,fantasy
after the steaming turd that was justice league i didnt anticipate this latest dceu offering being any goodi was wrong its great not 1010 great but still great the synth heavy soundtrack and gorgeous trippy visuals set this apart from the other dceu movies making this the thor ragnarok of this franchisego see it,fantasy
 did not live up to the hype im not sure why i had high hopes for another dc film you would think i might have learned my lesson after the last few letdowns i didnt and i was thoroughly disappointed with this shell of a moviethe story is generic and boring the acting is unconvincing and even comical at times the cgi is so overwhelming and obvious that it distracts the audience the fightingwar sequences are not choreographed well and the conflict at the end of the movie didnt even make sensei love superhero movies and am not a stranger to movies that require a little imagination in order to digest this movie reaches for the stars while forgetting every pillar required to construct a great film it was not worth the money or the time i spent watching it,fantasy
those underwater scenes blew me away jason does a great job as look forward to the next movie,fantasy
 movie in dc universe reminds me of black panther in mcu high box office number for a flashy movie the issue is however if you are a true comic fan you will walk a way with mix feelingsim dont know dc as much as i know marvel but i had few obvious problems with the movie big one was the power ranger costumes of atlatis and then somewhat subpar script and acting to be honest i would rate justice league more than any day at least justice league carried more dc essence in the movie you can clearly see that is made for better entertainment experience than focusing on dc attributes somewhat similar to recent thor ragnarok black panter etc in mcu where they were really pop cone movies made for general audiences to talk away with a relaxed feelingend of the day studios need to make  and this movie is made to do just that dcs darker attributes didnt work so well to attract a larger audience in any recent movies you cant achieve big box office numbers by trying to impress the comic fan base you need everyone to watch the movie so for that you need a movie with good cgi flashy story line not necessarily a good script good action and happy endingi rate 65 it is watchable and entertaining at most parts but then as a comic fan i walk away little disappointed,fantasy
by farthe most respected and watchable dc movie,fantasy
old school story effects are fine but the armour of the color just remind me of the pineapple,fantasy
now dont get me wrong was okay it just wasnt kind of film that i enjoyed rather that much i tjust felt like dcs version of an underwater black panther someone has to step up to be the heir of an ancient kingdom that has been technologically advanced and a vengeful person wants to be the ruler of atlantis wakanda and there is even a battle to the death between and vulko tchalla and kilmonger but that is just my perspective christ this movie even has an octopus yes a bloody octopus doing his own drum solo anthony doing drum solo in antman,fantasy
its not boring all the time its actually boring just a few times but most of the other time its simply not interestingit has many flaws its way too long it looks like a notsogood videogame amber heard is past her prime at times she actually looks bad  and has not learned acting skills to compensate temuera morissons digital deaging is terrible it was supposed to give us jango fett instead we got some overweight strangelooking middleaged guy the story is way too all over the place and derivative of black panther movie dune and bunch of others theres no explanation for meras powers of water manipulation which nobody else demonstrates most of the humor is pretty flat as is most of the acting its not only amber most of the stuff thats going on does not make sense even for a comic book moviebut its not terrible not even really bad there are good jokes here and there most of the time its not boring it carries through and doesnt fall apart at the end feminism isnt too crazy sure mera saves and guides our hero in ways that dont make sense including beating up several commandos but at least she doesnt beat and his brother up the sicily segment is nice its action sequences are the only ones that make much sense and are interesting  hell even amber looks decent here and almost really actsthere are worse superheroorigin movies but this one all things considered is not worth a watchprobably the best joke comes at the start when nicole kidman finding herself above water for the first time sees the terrible device that is the tv set and immediately destroys it as the biggest threat but there are a few later on just dont get annoyed at the many oneliners that tries to pull only a few of which actually work,fantasy
all i see is film adaptations from avatar braveheart thor plus many others i was expecting dory to jump out and save everybody,fantasy
where do i start enough colouring and flashing scenes to murder an epileptic corny lines and seriously predictable montagesother than that the film was ok some comedy fight scenes slightly spectacular but cgid the crap out ofone scene made me laugh he fell endless stories and landed with a thud yet in the next scene falling off a roof seemed deadly6 out of 10 is being polite,fantasy
story is common but shooting of action is good and vfx is soooo beautiful you can enjoy this without watching justis league,fantasy
this movie is really cheesy and not necessarily in a good way bad humor awful music choices and terrible implementation hammy acting forced romance overly simplified plot 2 decent villains instead of one great antagonist nowhere near the disaster that justice league was not as messy as suicide squad was not as heartfelt as wonder woman was and nowhere near as epic and powerful as man of steel or batman v supermanultimate cut the visuals at gorgeous momoa is just as lovable as he is in real life but them movie is little more than just ok,fantasy
compared to the past dceu movies that are known to have epic build but dark heavy storylines this could be called somewhat silly but it still shares the epicness and build even im a big fan of the past dceu movies especially the snyder ones i still enjoyed lightness it also offer a lot of very satisfying redemption moments i would say you would wish to rewatch it immediatelyloved every minute of it,fantasy
this movie was so cringe its only saving grace was the special effects then again i suppose thats what draws the crowds in 510 glad that i bootlegged it,fantasy
now im fan of marvel cinematic universe and dcs aswellproblem with both of those is that only few of their films are good everything else they make is only for moneybut this this was goldstoryhonestly i expected this to be crap and have same old story but nowhen tsunami came i though dad would die but he didnt so it didnt give that usual superhero story vibe it felt better aswell the part that he didnt want to rule the kingdom or have anything to do with itcharactersyou cant have better than jason momoa he literally borned for this part he looked perfect his acting was on point and boy that golden suit made my daymera aka amber heard aswell good acting and looked perfect for the partvulko was 510 character same old family friends who helps out the princemy 8 points go to good cgistorycharacters and for being one of the best superhero movies of this decade,fantasy
i must admit i am not a comic book fan so i knew nothing of before seeing this as a standalone film it works the story of the sea gods is quite different for me and i thought is was done wellthe lead character was a bit of a relief from the normal super hero and i thought he was played well some of the side characters got a bit irritating and the film took a predictable path towards the end but it was still well worth the watch,fantasy
following the marvel way and encouraged by the success of dark knight trilogy dc established dceu in 2013 with man of steel which i found slow and boring but was a decent success then came another boring film dawn of justice and pathetic suicide squad after that came the first female superhero film wonder woman which worked wonders for dceu but those wonders didnt last after the release of justice league a blatant copy of avengersand now dceu comes with who we saw in justice league but i was wondering where he was as only focus was on wonder woman flash and superman narrates the origin of arthur curry half human half atlantean in the first few minutes it captures your attention with excellent action scene of nicole kidman after then the film takes you to a visual treat jason momoa mass intro underwater scenes atlanta kingdom fight between arthur and his half brother escaping from atlanta to get the golden trident the superb action scene in italy arthur getting the trident and the final battle all these does not let you take off your eyes at the screen only drawback is story is not that great and slightly similar to thor 1 was my best 3d experience on the whole is an absolute visual treat which not even a marvel film provided me dc must concentrate for the time being only on solo superhero films hats off to director james wan,fantasy
i can never get why arthur insists hes not gonna be the king at the start but becomes a king in the end,fantasy
i can summarize my experience by saying everything in this movie like editing cinematography etc is over except acting by 2 dollars,fantasy
i dont care what anybody say this is a fantastic movie ive seen it on the regular screen i want to go back and see it in 3d i cant wait for it to come out on dvd excellent movie a mustsee movie action pack from beginning to end never lapsed in my opinion ,fantasy
thats all i have 2 say but imdb says i must must write more,fantasy
the movie pretty much lived upto its hypeit delivers what was expected of it loads of actionbreath taking cgi and some campy humourjames wan did an awesome job overalla special mention to the action sequences which are beautifully shot  choreographedspoiler  there is a scene with horror elements in it with the vintage wan touchwhich is a bonusmeanwhile rupert gregson williams was a let downthe music in this movie pales in comparison to his work in wonder womanoverallworth your money,fantasy
this movie was like a bad version of james cameron avatar minus the moral of the story and actual pleasant to watch cgi,fantasy
amazing cgi decent storyline and good actinghowever the dialogue and overuse of cringy jokes often felt really forced and hard to look atthe best movie of the dceu so far but that bar wasnt that high to reach looking forward to shazam tho,fantasy
another late screening for a film released last year i wasnt dying to see it but had heard great and exciting things about the film and caught a late screening with my best friend to which we cackled and laughed throughout almost the entire film and i have no idea if this was good or badthis film was laughably cringy the dialogue and delivery by actors was at times awful and head shakingly poor the slow motion and loreal esque style zooms on the femme fatales were so laughablethe story was there i guess a sort of swash buckling adventure film momoa was momoa and not really a character amber heard was much better then her shameful appearance in justice league although some plot points seemed to be created with arthur not even knowing her name despite meeting each other before and the two seemingly having a historythe supporting cast were surprisingly poor willem dafoe did nothing and you could tell he was immensely bored nicole kidman was bad and i hate writing that as i love her her american accent which she couldnt even hold was shocking as well as temuera morrisons accent he attempted to put on here and therepatrick wilson was suitably over the top and chewing the scenery and he managed to make me laugh with his long drawn out war criesdolph lundgren was there i guess and his third act character shift was so poor djimon hounsou ludi lin and randall park were not in the film enough to make an impact graham mctavish was probably the least worst with his suitable powering performance michael beach whom i also enjoy had some disgustingly cringy lines as did his son played by yahya abdul mateen ii who portrayed fan favourite black mantathe effects at times were great and at other times horrible the cinematography was decent the music was decent if not forgettable some music choices were so bad so bad that they had to be pranking the audience especially that scene in italy we were just laughing our heads off it was unbelievable this film is so unbelievably cringy that it makes one wonder if what they are viewing is even reallord knows how julie andrews and john rhys davies got into this messthe imagination was great props to wan especially with character designs creatures and weapons etci cant express enough how laughable the film is and this is what worries me as since i was laughing i technically enjoyed the film at its own expense so i really have no clue what to rate it yes it was enjoyable with the action sequences and frankly superb uses of the long take in those scenes but it was also so hilariously poorthe dialogue which is at times was hard to hear was so expected that i was literally guessing the lines that would come next shameful another small gripe i had was the fact that the inhabitants of an underwater kingdom had american accents like reallyeverything is over directed wan mustve been saying on production that everything needs to be bigger sillier more ridicilious as if this was his only chance to make a superhero film which it doesnt even feel likecringy dialogue cringy close ups and cringy delivery makes a laughably defective but still somehow entertaining few hoursits a must see rubbish film like clash of the titans or prince of persia,fantasy
 looks a million dollars without ever looking real we can see the film has a megabudget but at the same time unlike many of the marvel universe films it just doesnt look real even during the rare times in the film where the action is on land and not in the sea you always have the very real sense that what you are watching was primarily played out against a green screenthe cast do their very best whilst being saddled with some uninspiring dialogue especially many of the atlantean characters who just sound unintentionally im sure pompous jason momoa is fine as the title character and amber heard is appealing as princess mera his developing undersea love interest but i would have dearly loved to have seen their characters as well as those of nicole kidman and temuera morrison for instance play out a few more scenes on dry landthe best i can say about the production is that it is imaginative and very creatively put together in a crossgeneric fashion but herein lies one of the major problems with the movie  its weirded out storyline much of this so called origin tale seems to be an excuse to create a hybrid of styles which i personally had great difficulty in subscribing too the whole idea of 7 civilisations living under the sea with advanced technology and amongst mutant species of fish and the like which landbased society has no idea about is just bizarre to be kindimagine a mix of star wars with the abyss and clash of the titans yes star wars at the bottom of the sea if you think thatll rock your boat youll probably love me much as i like a good super hero film just doesnt fit the bill ill take the avengers before this sort of cartoonish stuff any day the action is better choreographed the villains more serious the dialogue is far more consistently funny and things do seemingly appear to be occurring in the real world,fantasy
i think that the movies have no action or adventurenothing  i feeled like im watching a romantic movie so ,fantasy
time pass movie worth watching once dont go with high expectations just confused with what happens when poops in that sea or ocean just asking nicole kidman last scene catching up with temuera derek morrison was bit over rated the way she runs in to his arms was bit gayish why kill the buzz,fantasy
you cost me 25k by getting the conan role over jon andersenson whatever love your other roles enjoyable but the cgi is cartoonish and the supporting cast is b role maybe you cost them too much good for you care to cough up andersens 25 anyways not even close to marvel grade momoa carried this movie dc tried to mimic mcu they should stay dark like they were with batman theres an audience for that marvel has cornered the humor,fantasy
truly loved this film some parts made me laugh the ending with his father was perfectly done with happy tears best of all there was no politicalsjw or pc agenda in this film like most of the films and tv shows made now so enjoyable,fantasy
i dont even know where to start to be honest how could they go so wrong with this movie the plot is all over the place and theres just so much stupid random crap like sharks with lasers an octopus playing the drums pterodactyls in the earths core like wtf its no fault of jason momoas that this movie is bad honestly i feel sorry for everyone involved in the making of this cheesy cliche poorly written film im sure nicole kidman is glad she has a small role,fantasy
apparently when u have no acting skills all you have to do is screw people in hollywood to get cast in a movie too bad amber heard was cast in this movie and every other move she had ever been in by far the worst attempt at acting ive seen since mariah carey in glitter their was a lot of cgi in this movie maybe just a tad too much lots of fighting and under water scenes the story line is about the same as every other superhero movie so the lazy writers must have had hangovers or just didnt care when they were writing this because their was nothing new or extravagant in it basically all the main characters were casted with all the wrong people except for jason momoa who played perfectly i give him a 1010 amber heard scenes made me want a refund she gets a 210 and im being very generous patrick wilson was acting a little over the top and it was hard to ever take him seriously he gets a 610 nicole kidman started the movie with poor acting as well but surprised me towards the end by finishing very strong i think it was because she was standing next to amber heard and a turnip acts better than her she get a 810 william defoe player a lesser of a part than i had hoped and wished to see him a little more within the story he always gets very into his characters and performs stunningly he gets a 910 for his role i literately will never want to watch this again because i could not stop laughing at how bad amber heard was it just made me irritated they would cast a potentialess hack in a massive film full of professionals with her barely high school dramalike skills set shame shame,fantasy
the story is a total borefeast  the pilot is an automat and i could follow i swear the whole movie using only one braincell and yes the cgi is not bad but i would rather like it on my computer so i could play the hero myselfthe story of is not really the story of but of every 2nd superhero of the dc or marvel cosmosi guess okay for the common superheronerd for the rest of this world there is only one question left why people watch always the same story again and again with characters wearing different costumes,fantasy
underwater scenes are beautiful but so much cgi the motion underwater when actors move is not always seamless the music was repetitive and was used to add to the acting which seemed lacking at times not my favorite super hero film but the did a lot more with the character than i expected,fantasy
i liked this movie it was exciting kept me engaged and the graphics were awesome the story line was good a bit corny though even still it was worth the money,fantasy
i am surprised to see all the 1010 and 110 reviewsi would really like to see more people calmly describing their experiences in the theater rather than voting for their favorite team with a 1010 actor director comic book franchise whatever the same is true for people voting with a 110 against another groupi had a good time at the theater watching but i did leave at the end feeling disappointed in many aspects of the film no need to get into these now because they are described in detail in other reviewsi admit my first impulse was to rate it a 110 to balanceout all the 1010 reviews but then i realized that i would be doing the same thing as they were  providing an inaccurate review based on things other than the movie quality so i am rating a 610  maybe it deserves a 510  not sureanyway lets get back to accurately reviewing the movies to help others decide whether to go see them or not rather than trying to tilt the balance of the other votes,fantasy
not the worst movie ive seen beats the latest batman moviesbut really just kinda silly as a wholeaqua man was great but everybody else was just blahvisual were pretty good but almost too much cgi at timesworth seeing but wont blow your socks off,fantasy
this could have been a good movie but the dialogue was corny and the directing left much to be desired the wonderful special effects couldnt make up for all the hokey storyline momoa and the other actors did a good job with what they had to work with arthurs quick wit sarcasm and bad boy attitude was great and went a long way toward making the film interesting,fantasy
visually stunning solid story just needed to be fleshed out with more dialogue fun from start to finish,fantasy
the scenes were amazing but the lines could have used some improvement great movie,fantasy
to say that superhero movies are liked in this day and age is an astronomicalunderstatement no matter what realm or studio these heroes come from people are lining up to see every movie starring a supernatural hero dc universe dcu has been riding this wave for some time and while they may have fallen off a little bit here with their newest movie there are still a lot of things to hang in there forthe film starts off by introducing two characters through arthurjason moana narration his father tom curry temeura morrison and his mother queen atlanta nicole kidman and how their meeting and falling in love and ultimately more important the child they had were never supposed to be then after a few years have passed queen atlantas old life catches up to her as she was part of an arranged marriage in atlantis so in order to protect her family she must return to fulfill her part in the marriage after this the movie zips ahead 20 years and viewers can see that arthur has grown up to be a mammoth of a man who possess special powers thanks to his mothers genetics and we quickly and violently learn that he is using these powers to help those in needthe dialogue was lacking and in spots the humor was rather dry and shortlived the poor script causes there to be moments where something seems to be lost from the scene because of how it seems the words are just thrown in it seems the scriptwriters tried to be funny in situations that called for something serious or smooth and this leads to a choppy sounding dialogue that leaves viewers wondering if the scriptwriters didnt read things over before they submitted it an example of this is when arthur dramatically breaks his way into a submarine then gives a sheepish grin and says permission to come aboard the screenwriters couldnt have come up with a less original quote causing everyone to shake their heads as there is nothing more predictable that could have been said and yet they kept it also there is a major lacking of back story for black manta he plays a major role in the film and yet we know next to nothing about his past this leaves manta to be a shallow husk of a potentially wonderful character and gives the viewers almost no reason to even like him let alone cheer for himwith over five different studios working on the cgi for this film its not surprising the filmmakers were able to pull off the realistic water effects and seeminglyaccurate battle scenes the way that they made the fight scenes not only look very real but also had to work with transitioning from land to water shots quickly and there was no scene disruption which allowed the viewers to stay focused on the movie the cgi in this movie is comparable if not better then almost any other action movie out today some examples could be avengers infinity war black panther justice league and with all of these advanced cgi is utilized to create an almost undeniable realitysomething that really stood out to me even as i cringed through the dialogue was how the movie used its audio i really enjoyed how they used not only songs during action pieces or peaceful pans over beautiful scenery but just the simple nondiegetic music that helps to deepen the moment looking back now i can count more than a few times where i got goosebumps leading up to or in a scene because of the audioafter diving into the underwater world of viewers can see that though there were some rough patches overall this movie was rather smooth sailing when you look at the animation combined with the audio you get one great movie and though the dialogue can be rough i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun and beautiful looking action movie,fantasy
its always a pleasure to see a studio recognize their flaws and do their best to correct the mistakes that caused them so much heartache in the past with a very enjoyable man of steel setting a tone that would be completely overdone by the time batman vs superman dawn of justice hit theatres it was only a matter of time before they decided to change it up suicide squad was financially successful but admittedly a step in the wrong direction justice league was a mess of a movie but the saving grace of the franchise will always be known as wonder woman loved by critics and fans across the globe dc and warner brothers decided to steer the ship in a new direction taking a step into the past and creating origin stories for the characters weve only briefly seen it worked with wonder woman and im happy to say that i believe its also working withbeing very very loosely tied to the previous films almost not at all sees arthur curry go from an infant to a fullgrown man being a halfbreed from both land in our world and the underwater kingdom of atlantis he comes to the realization that hes the rightful heir to the throne challenged by his only brother who despises his existence this creates tension amongst the people with some very likable side characters and others who will more than likely have repercussions in future installments theres a lot to like about this film in terms of character and story which is what i was expecting to find lackingjason momoa once again demands the audiences attention as he completely invests himself in this wacky character his charisma is easily one of the highlights of this film and his many journeys with amber heards mera are a blast to watch this is a film filled with tons of adventure and i was on the edge of my seat throughout a lot of it its visually stunning for the most part and i found that made it the biggest looking film of the franchise in terms of scope although it does borrow from pretty much every movie youve ever seen it mixes in enough new content to differentiate itself from othersas it seems from my review i had a blast watching but its by no means a perfect movie even by the standards set by this franchise patrick wilson plays king orm arthurs younger brother and although his motivations are clear his portrayal is quite overthetop i personally took issue with this as hes in quite a bit of the film the disposable villains of this film actually have quite a bit of depth and backstory but are highly underutilized i felt like they were part of a setup for something bigger in the future without ruining it the scenes where these characters are used are very welldone so its a very minor flaw in my opinion there are many small issues i have with the movie as a whole but in retrospect theyre all nitpicksin the end embraces the fact that the premise of an underwater city is ridiculous and runs with that from beginning to end from giant sea battles to genuine hearttoheart moments between characters that stood out to me this is a film that has every i like about good blockbusters while its not one of the best superhero films ive ever seen its a joy to watch and easily in the discussion for as one of the best movies of this franchise if youre a fan of comicbased films id definitely suggest giving this one a shot,fantasy
so first off i really enjoyed the movie especially after some of the other horrendous dc offerings however after the shiny front there are some things that disturb me because they are a bit strange i think technically the film is good although a bit too much cgi here are some of the quarrels i have with itthe motives of the first villain that is introduced so first off why are the pirates shooting the whole submarine up to potentially reduce its ability to work including all the seamen inside it would seem a lot easier to use some gas since they are all wearing masks anyhow except the named characters of course also the very valid argument acquaman makes that they killed all these innocents and now complain that he does not help them i feel very little compassion for this villain and it seems forcedwhile the underwater visuals are stunning to look it some stuff is just over top for instanceunderwater waterfallsfake looking movements some of the cgi enhanced movements just look irritatingly fake for instance when someone jumps in the water and accelerates midair it just feels physically very wrongso we are looking at a potential war on a global scale yet the rest of the justice league does nothingwanting to prevent the deaths of millions doesnt prevent acquaman from charging in with the trench and killing everything in the pathdont get me wrong still enjoyed the movie but how someone can give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating is beyond me 10 should mean that this is the best movie in this type of movies acquaman is enjoyable which at least should give it a 6 or 7 but it is in no way unique or phantastically acted etc,fantasy
this film reminded me of almost all other action films including transformers it is definitely a blockbuster film aimed at getting us to the theaterthis is not a film to watch because the acting is good or the plot is great or because you are a serious film buff this is the type of film you go to see when you just want pure entertainment with lots of special effects and visuals was not so great in my opinion as a comicthe films first scenes made me gag a bit at the over abundance of makeup on the actors to make them look younger they almost looked like dolls and the acting was quite dull it gets better once you are past thatbut again its a blockbuster film aimed to satisfy your eyes with big colorful visuals on a big screen i gave it a decent rating because it was just what i expected when i went to see it i really doubt anyone expects this film to be a masterpiece film worthy of filmmaking awards and great acting kudos good for the kid inside,fantasy
it tells about arthur currys process of recognizing the true meaning of his familys blood and how he and meila retrieved the lost trident that could rule the sea and fought against om the ocean lord his halfbrother who was more hostile to human beings this is a popular and simple story about the growth of superheroesjames wan a great director was invited to direct james wan made up for the loopholes in the narrative of the film with exquisite pictures and exciting fights he also paved the way for the bitter enmity of the heros prehistory the film became neither heavy nor frivolous and the narrative was smooth and lightsome of the middle sections almost made me think of it as an environmentally friendly movie in which the ending of atlanna was different from the original onein december 9 2018 1210pmthe january 18 2019,fantasy
i still rate man of steel above when it comes to dceu movies but this movie is something different and i got what i expected i think dc is on the right track its time for superman sequel,fantasy
nice effects even good plot film similar to another dc films,fantasy
no hay mucho que decir efectos bien me resulto medianamente entretenida fin,fantasy
first of all nice casting choice no one couldve made cooler than jason mamoa and mera sexier than amber heard patrick wilson is here are you surprised its a james wan movie nice use of comedy though its only worth a chuckle the story is safe but solid nothing unexpected but nothing horrible and quite touching to be honest the effects are great if youd seen the first trailer the effects were only tolerable but now with the effects all done it is enchanting the colors are very vibrant dc is taking notes from marvel and everything just looked beautiful the credit song everything you are by skylar grey is very good so good that i sat through all the credits,fantasy
its not such a great movie the cgi sea creatures looked more like robotic sharks than living beings from an underwater that detail somehow really bothered me the actors do a good job jason m is a very likeable guy and the story makes for an entertaining movie with spme funny moments enjoyable but not the greatest,fantasy
this movie is just a good movie overall the story flows perfectly without any unecessary moments the performances are great as well as the costumes overall just a fun movie to see in the cinemas and one of the best dc movies,fantasy
kings only fight for nation but you fight for everyone ,fantasy
realy nice acting and good history i like that movie joking and hard fight but a lot of effects used,fantasy
it was relaxing nothing bothered me at this moviei loved the 90s music the rose scene the costumes the effects the fact that the actors were adultspeople complain that they didnt feel chemistry between characters yes this isnt the notebook but hey its just a popcorn movie it is pretty sweet enjoy it as it is,fantasy
 is an entertaining movie about the oedipus complex two sons are separated from their mother as a result they are totally desperate one son blames atlantis for his loss the other son king orm blames humans he is desperate to the extent that he wants to destroy the worldat the end of the movie both sons reunite with their mother and it seems they are going to live happily ever after i think this is a rather superficial ending both and king orm needed their mum when they were growing up not only they never fully experienced a semihealthy family life but most likely they also projected all of their frustrations on the loss of mother in other words for both of them mum symbolises both mother figure and also everything that they lack in their lives eg i could achieve this or that only if i had a mother we know atlanna the mother cant fill these roles nowin a more realistic world i bet after few days both and king orm are going to feel miserable again because no one ever fully recovers from the sadomasochism of their childhood11 adam phillips psychotherapist and literary critic,fantasy
finally they seem to get it action romance comedy pretty much nailed the marvel mixi went to watch this with my mrs we both enjoyed it for different reasonsgreat direction in the dc universe i just hope they keep it up,fantasy
although is not a famous hero or frequently shown hero this movie build up a remarkable hero for dc fans,fantasy
right first things first i hate marvel films and dc films however this is not the worst film in the world i know that as ive seen mary poppins returnsin between eating a bucket of mixed salt n sweet popcorn and a punnet of foam bananas bought by my 13 yo son this was actually quite a funny film in parts and i love mum very nice start to the film thank youtestament to the okness of iti only fell asleep during the big fight bit at the end but its alright i woke up in time to see mum cuddling dad i love being at an age where i now actually like nicole kidman never happened before 5910,fantasy
the most noticeable issue with it as a film is that it takes itself way too seriously for the bmovie level dialogue story and acting to be taken as tongueincheek particularly the performances by patrick wilson yahya abdulmateen and nicole kidman the story is also not very engaging and doesnt give you much reason to care about the characters so the third acts big reveal just feels like a dues ex machina to give the end of the film some kind of emotional weight there were definitely some fun action sequences and a couple of funny moments but nothing about this movie made me interested in seeing more movies or the others in its extended universe,fantasy
it was a solid film but the dc isnt over yet for now,fantasy
i think this focuses to much on landscape then core storyopen scenes were great some during and towards the end too much cgi and overly exaggerated below seasome decent scenes an ok movie,fantasy
 its a nice action movie that completely embrace the marvel cinematic universe stylethe movie is fun and entertaining but the characters are somehow inconsistent nicole kidman is a little ludicrous with her wig and acting and there is a big plot hole the events take place about a year after justice league like its said during a scene and here comes the question where is superman there is no point in fearing a war with atlantis if there is superman the movie could end after one phone call hello clark its me arthur yeah im fine listen can you kick my brothers ass ok thank you see you laterok maybe arthur is too proud and doesnt want to seek help but after the first warning from atlantis tsunami and so on i think that superman could just go above atlantis use his heat vision and boil everyoneif you watch with this in mind its hard to enjoy it because there is no sense at all in what is happening but if you can pretend that superman does not exist its a nice movie,fantasy
definitely a flash gordon style action movie absolutley insane suspension of disbelief but done in a fun and harmless way the actors throw themselves into the storyline with total abandon hats off to them it wouldnt have worked otherwise some quite funny moments that were a little unexpected and also a message about how much we care about the environment i dont usually like message films but this was quite harmelss imho and actually completely relevant to the story my son loved it and it made me smile i recommend it,fantasy
beccanicole kidman fell into a rabbit hole the young man who ran over her little boy was right about alternate universes if space is infinite he tells the grieving mother anything is possible the title of the film derives from a comic book that jasonmiles tenner created the plot synopsis goes like this a boys father dies he was a scientist who uncovered a system of interconnected holes to alternate universes the boy goes looking for him in one of the panels from behind a tree he spies on a man who is indistinguishable from his dad but its not dad interacting with duplicates of mom and himself he is both here and there an audience of one watching an actor play the story of his life the tree is a demarcation a metaphor for a bunchedup curtain pushed to one side which separates him from the domestic scene playing out in the front yard it could be a scene based on real life his life from the universe he just departed from as a passive observer in a sense its like almost being able to touch the movie screen the filmic world that lies beyond it a double for the world we live in to the boy its an imitation of life an adaptation but in this movie the screen has no negative space filled with actors dopplegangers unaware of their multiplicity who play the same people from other galaxies he is an extra he knows not to walk pass the tree and walk into the misenscenethe more you think about it every film is like an alternate universe for kidman sitting at the palais in cannes or in this case comiccon she sees her twin just like that boy watching life unfold and go on without him objectivelyand subjectively its still her its just another version a queen from atlantis the boy confronted with seeing himself being played by himself an impersonator he cant be objective gestures delivery of words comportment all these actions are secondguessed as would an actress films being what they are selfcontained worlds where anything can happen and in theory interconnected with the actor in hisher many guises being the linchpin kidman theoretically finds the portal that allows her to be an irish immigrantfar and away a sociopathic broadcast journalistto die for a courtesanmoulin rouge or a grieving motherrabbit hole in she is a princess who can breathe underwater and kick ass on landthe lighthouse keeper finds a strange woman splayed out on the rocks tomtememura morrison presumes she washedup on shore he is orientated to think horizontally but for the sake of phantasmagorical thinking imagine a scenario in which becca similar to the waitress from the aha music video for take on me finds passage into the comic book furthermore accepting that hypothetical imagine again if rabbit hole the comic book not the filmor the play it was based on was adapted for the screen and was renamedhe fell from the sky she landed on her back she tumbled out of a wormhole she is on the same mission as jasons standin the illustrated boy to be reunited with a loved one becca gets her wish in rabbit hole she muses aloud somewhere out there im having a good time becca is an atheist its science that comforts her becca wants to see her child not in heaven but in another world because in another world danny is alive becca despises angels if you think about it theyre not much different from the undead angels are like flying zombies becca wants to undo what as a parent she feels is a transgression as queen atlanna she gets to start a family all over again this time mother keeps son safe making up for the day she forgot to latch the gate the atonement is all the more impressive owing to the degree of difficulty it takes more than locking the door to keep king orms soldiers from bringing harm to her son she kicks punches and throws these invaders all over the house in rabbit hole beyond the white picket fence beyond the road where danny was run over is the ocean the mother a transfigured woman the queen of atlantis watches her son emerge from the water for becca it fulfills a wish from her own world to see danny walk through the fence door redemption at last finally the longawaited hug the clinch from another universe,fantasy
i went into this film not expecting too much i liked both the justice league movie and wonder woman and thought this might be on par with those but eclipsed them i saw the 143 minute run time and was worried it would drag on but is probably one of the best superhero movies ive seen and does not feel like it drags at all loved the action in it the effects were great and the story got me right from the start until the end it was a nice refreshing superhero movie and if you like those types of movies youre bound to love,fantasy
honestly if someone had a go about about the cgi in the movie you could smack them over the head yeah like in reality you can speak and breathe underwater its a decent movie though rather long my friend ended up sleeping through some of the fight scenes but it was overall good better than justice league sorry to those fans out there but it was genuinely bad they still kept the jokes and funny scenes at bay as well the effects were great though heard didnt convince me in some of her scenes which was a shamea good watch i recommend the movie,fantasy

  tc tonguetocheekcelluloid in this sea of the comic book heroes its getting tough to do something different so i guess that crazy idea got abandoned the lead mamoa delivers his lines fluidly he perfectly personifies the smarmy slightly vulnerable affable wise cracking confident charismatic  and somehow critically not arrogant character thats hard to dowillem the foe of immorality spits out evil faster than a goblin shark dolphen lundgren plays the wise yet stable voice of reason to the goofy bad prince patrick wilson i think nicole kidman thought she was in benjamin button wthin terms of plot and story line it was marvelous there was a misunderstood much more fit kind outcast of a prince with great morals who was trying to return to a kingdom left behind by a missing or deceased parent and its not like the body building demigod like much more charismatic brother character was looking for an almighty hammer he was looking for a trident not even close theyre different shapes and its not like the bad power mongering cruel impossible to like and moreover easy to hate sibling of a brother turned around emotionally and became a good guy the writers however did great with the thin plot given they cleverly used hydrology to create some cool water related concepts such as unique weaponry there were some interesting original concepts in here that i wont spoil  the cgi was awesome the only blurring was on the lines of reality as they would say in akronym ohio imho3dimax is the only way to see this movie ya i know it shows up great in this format and really accentuates the production effort,fantasy
i think this is probably second best in the dc universe of movies some things felt rushed and others were slightly dull to me but what i love about it is that it never went dark like the newer batman does which im not a big fan of and visually i loved it although some of how they did angles made me a bit dizzy also nothing with jason mamoa can ever be a complete letdown i was also surprised by nicole kidman being the love interest because in my head i thought she was lois lane but turns out i was just remembering her as batmans girlfriend and i was very confused as to why one supers gf was another moms for a little while anyway im just rambling thoughts instead of really reviewing so whatever you should watch tho,fantasy
story line is good but didnt like too much cast cinematography visuals and some other things are good,fantasy
 visuals are amazing good jokesthe film overall is quite ok however sometimes there were moments lengthened i am impressed how much fantasy people can have after whatching this film,fantasy
i was pretty amazed how many things happened in 1 movie by the middle of the movie there was almost no progress in the story so i thought this is gonna be a trilogy but then suddenly the second part of the movie has huge amount of events so they actually finish the story in 1 moviei was with maria u so i was wondering if shes waiting for it to finish or not but actually later she said she kind of liked the moviethe story is interesting but cant say they created an amazing world the movie does not have that much illogical stuff so most of the events make sense,fantasy
ggg very vyyvy video game going on db did everything from kevin gets more comfortable being used as,fantasy
stands up on its own as a film good cgi in fact too much cgi too many fights enemies charactersi could see people checking out of the narrative because of all the massive battlesdceu films have been quite dark in feel this film is very different in that respect feeling more like a marvel avengers movie not surprising it has already become highest box take for its opening weekendspectacle overcoming characters again but best if the dceu so far,fantasy
when i see the underwater that time my mouth was opene 1 word is rounding in my head that what is that man how they do it such a big vfx,fantasy
first review on imdb not english native so sorry for that was not a bad movie it had awesome visual effects and strong acting it had a great cast of sealife and locations and looked amazing on that i give it a strong 1010the problem with most movies and this one in particular is that is made by the books story wisethe bellow part applies to a lot of movies including this one1 the good guys do something bad  some of them faces are covered the good guy comes most likely the faceless guys die2 a evil someone wants to do something bad that would affect everyone3 the hero doesnt want to intervene but its convince either by someone or by watching something4 the bad guy is cocky and sent just some of his milion strong army to interfere5 against all odds the good guy defeats evil and also he gets the girl6 he shows mercy towards the evil guy as he was weaponlessthere you have it people sure it looks awesome but wont stand the test of time you know why because the story its not masterful written its alright but i for one dont remember alright i remember witcher 3 and infinity war not wonder woman or bvss mcu has a character base that is similar to dcu but in the former the story  the feel and the guts to do something awesome its 10 years in the futureis this movie worth it hell yeah its a superhero movie that has awesome graphics good acting and an ok story but it lacks the spart of genius that infinity war had,fantasy
i almost gave up watching this movie due to bad review in top youtube channels but after watching this movie i have to say is this what is called fake review where channels lie about a movie to fill up their agenda this movie has action scene which will rival  even beat best of the marvels scene from winter soldier to civil war its a thrill ride which is full of actions  even the emotional part will make a grown man cry as thats how the events appear its not a whiny character buildup movie its a story of a man who is already part of justice league but dont want to take the thrown of atlantis so its a story about what forced him to do this when he actually hated his people this movie is build up such a way that time flies you wont even notice it as it has such a wonderful structure of storytelling it has clash of titan like epicness  avatar like new world build up you cant ask for anything more as it delivers everything you can wish for from a movie jokes are not force feed  it was natural  its serious moments were really serious cgi was really next level i think this is a must watch in theater as its sound effects  musics are really enjoyable in big screen i dont watch a movie twice but i think i will watch it second time as i already miss the awesome action scene that i watched,fantasy

 has more going for it than most of the latest contributions from dcid say wonder woman has a clear upper hand on and i do not for the life of me understand anyone saying otherwise but is a well litt hope for the dc universe and i definately want to see more of him the goodarthus is a cool guy straight out and hands down his character also has a great backstory and great development in this movie in my opinion and i must say that dc did him justice no pun intended by the way they presented this backstory i believe batman vs superman went a little too deep and too far back with a lot of backstorybuildup  but did it just right for me deep emotional thorough but not wasting anyones time just the important stuff that hits you in the heartthen there is action cinematography cgi colors and all of the above  and the movie is pure eye candy maybe not the coolest fighting scenes but definitely cool fighting scenes some original camera handlingrotations made for a nice little twist to certain close combat scenes when it is not close combat its underwater star wars i think i can dig thatthe badim sure this is all very true to the original material and all but im not all that into having 2 bad guys in one movie not like this anyhow one of them was great the other was not hint its black manta a massive cliche if you ask me and and watch this get down voted by the comic book nerds o for the record i do recognize that he did play a significant role in the plot development but i still didnt like him  so thereto me black manta got the same effect on this movie as team rockets gets in every pokemon episode if you get that referencefurthermore while the plot is good per se it is utterly without plot twists so you will probably never go whaaaaaat anytime during this movie youll predict most of the movie plot development and ending by the time 20 minutes have passed and youll most likely be correct in all your major predictions but this stuff is totally possible to roll along with and enjoy despite of and most movies these days are just like this so im not pulling too many points because of itif there is one more tiny setback i feel the need to mention mention is that i find some of the humor misplaced the movie has good humor and strong emotional scenes both frequent and well done separately but sometimes the movie just missed my emotional state  which itself is responsible for putting me in im brought half way to tears then served a joke that feels inappropriate and visa versa its not like this the whole movie but enough times to for me to make note of itall in all 7  10 is good its hes cool and its all pretty many good actors btw  i forgot the mention that its worth the watch but no minds will be blown out of the park,fantasy
doesnt really live up to the hype yes it is the best dcu film for the franchisebut that doesnt mean a lot jokes fell flat and the plot seemed quite predictable,fantasy
but when i came out i am now a dc movie series fan this movie is really good i want more like it let this guy keep making more movies really liked it,fantasy
i will explain why i have the score i did after each recorded scorevisuals9most astounding cgi i have seen in a long time possibly even first right after planet valerianbut i feel it was a tad by much on the cgithe whole battle at the end was the most beautiful cgi battle ive ever seen i felt engaged and wondering who was going to win in all the chaos obviously i knew would win but bear with me it was chaos and i love chaosplot4hero has to endure a treacherous journey to obtain an item that will ensure victory in the end honestly aqua man shouldve just challenged him to a battle on land and he shouldve killed him that is how the movie shouldve gone but i digresssoundtrack9very awesome opera at scenes of intense action and quick music during times of escapespeech3 oh god this was horrible at some points of the movie i couldnt hear mamoa speak because of the action and music and at other times he doesnt speak clearly they shouldve done a retakefight scenes9awesome fighting with the tridents but they seemed to carry on way to long the fights shouldve been 6090 seconds long fights dont last that long the action was really great thoughlove story9 and 4well start with the 9tho old man and the queen atlanta was so heart touching to me the old man had such a sad look in his eyes when she didnt come back he went down to the docks for 20 years hoping she would come back and one day she did at the endnow the 3the love story between the ginger and felt so forced and very fake at some points you are able to tell that the actors were disinterested in the love story and it shows on cameraenemies8 the enemies and the plot to start a war with us is very well executed by the director the acting and the style that is shown made me feel that it was very well thought outbut the enemy that was like a buffer to fighting king orm was horrible shouldve just killed him when they were on the submarine along with his fatherresolutionwe all knew that would win but he shouldve mopped his he floor with him in the 1 v 1 which shouldve been on land is obviously stronger and more talentedmy final score is 7average but better than average,fantasy
i liked it less than i thought i would after seeing the user reviews i got bored too dc is not even close to marvel the light humor seemed forced,fantasy
the movie was so predictable that i havent even watched the trailers before the movie itself and i knew what would happen in every single scene it was so predictable that i am dead serious the guy next to me in the cinema was completing the sentences in half of the scenes until he fell asleep i almost fell asleep a couple of times but somehow i managed to survivethe acting was awful thats all im going to say regarding this partthe cringy moments where so many that i kept asking myself why i paid money to see this piece of  art  after every battle was acting like a power ranger even the posing i am not kidding i couldnt believe my eyes at some scenes purely disgustingi am a huge fan of superheroe movies but this was a disgracethe only thing that was above average was the cgi cool effects some nice battles but not many and awfully cornytldr this movie should not have more than 5 score but it seems there are a lot of bots and paid people in here 2 and a half hours of wondering what is happening 2 and a half hours of regret i created an imdb profile just to tell the truth i have hated so many overrated movies and i desperately wanted to write reviews about them but it was never enough for me to create a profile this was more than enough i didnt hear one happy person in the crowd after leaving not to say that 99 of the people stormed out before the final scene and it was obvious that they couldnt wait to get out asap dont waste your money,fantasy

arthur curry jason momoa lives with his father on the maine coast a caretaker of a lighthouse with the mentorship of vulko willem dafoe and the revelations of mera amber heard he discovers that he is the halfbreed heir to the underwater kingdom of atlantis as the rightful successor to the throne he must tangle with his brother orm patrick wilson to save the surface world from destruction meanwhile black manta yahya abdulmateen ii seeks vengeance on arthur for the death of his father 2018 is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull its reminiscent of thor 2011 and thor the dark world 2013 but with spectacular undersea realms instead of asgard  realms nearby yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence which might make thrilling but less compelling storywisestill its very eventful with loads of energy maybe too eventful for its own good and i liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations including the sahara desert and sicily meanwhile amber is stunning as redheaded mera even nicole kidman shows up as arthurs mother atlanna speaking of arthur momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the publics generally weak perception ofthe film is a bit overlong at 2 hour 23 minutes and was shot in australia hastings point amity point southport main beach  currumbin beach newfoundland  labrador canada and morocco erfoud  merzougagrade bb,fantasy
this ones worth skipping may yet be a beacon of hope for the dc extended universe this one and wonder woman managed to get many superhero fans pumped without needing to take too many cues from the marvel universe  which is a thing that other dc films have done no matter how effectively one blinds oneself to that factim not saying is especially good but at least its acceptable  sans a few laughable vfx shots and power rangerstier costumes it is fundamentally competent thus outranking the likes of suicide squad and justice league it does everything a movie about he who speaks with the fish needs to do which really isnt muchjason momoa plays a halfhuman halfatlantean prince going by arthur curry on the streets and on the underwater streets amber heard is his love interested mera the daughter of the king of one of the atlantis tribes dolph lundgren theres also evil brother orm patrick wilson whose plan is to unite the underwater kingdoms to declare war on humanity willem dafoe plays the typical old mentor wearing his goofiest suit since goblin and nicole kidman is the queen of atlantisthis as you can surely tell is pretty standard and unextraordinary and again this is quite the step up from the bowel movements dc and warner bros normally release you have accomplished mediocrity and i applaud you on some level it is completesitting in the directors chair this time around is james wan a man more at home in horror although not completely dreadful here even if it goes without saying that this is more of a product than an art project i wouldnt say this film exemplifies wans voice he was just doin his job that said the action is fairly well shotthe cityscape of atlantis is admittedly an interesting setting and probably the main reason to see the film its pretty albeit no more groundbreaking than worlds like pandora or the city ruled by king triton im glad dc fans have gotten something more promising even if my own thumb points downward but well see what this means for the future of the dceu recall that key actors have dropped out and people are more hyped for the joker of another canon there is some speculation that next years avengers finale will double as a finale for the persistent superhero film craze they say that this might be what finally  finally  kills the comicbook movie im sorry we didnt get to darkseid,fantasy
film is nothing special even thor the dark world that is considered as the worst movie in mcu is 100 times better than this they are constantly trying to make dceu better but they messed up with batman and justice league you cant beat mcu 510 is most objective rating for this movie adressing the good and bad things in this moviealso i dont understand this 1010 reviews and that is my reason to suspect that those are paid reviews or maybe those who review does not understand how the rating system works giving 1010 you are practically saying that this is the best movie ever compare infinity war with this mess,fantasy
it would be cruel to rotten this gem stop being a hater and appreciate this cinematograpic marvel fluent screenplay check sorcery cinematography check good acting emotional narrative check,fantasy
wonderful and stunning from beginning to end the cast and visuals dont fail to impress i was practically standing in my seat with joy and excitement throughout looking forward to seeing and experiencing it again,fantasy
really poor graphics character development and appallingly bad attempts at humourstop trying to attempt what marvel does so well ie humour and wit and get back to making darker movies,fantasy
ill be briefvisuals and sound effects excellentsoundtrack not bad not captivating but not badplot average not too interesting or intricately woven but for action lovers the action will make up for itcharacters mostly wellcrafted with the exception of merastory wasnt very engaging or inspiring if youre looking for a memorable string of takeaways this movie is not really for you,fantasy
ten minutes in i started feeling like jeeeeze cut the strings and let me watch the god damn movie and then there was moor music bombastic music music that never endsclearly had the producer no confidence in either script nor actors to carry the storyloved the special effects really appreciated the drama but jeeeeze whats with this music,fantasy
no doubt that vfx are good in fact i would say these are the best ever from dc but i felt something was missing in every superhero movie its important to shown how the character is built how he becomes more responsible after discovering superpowers strugle sacrifice relations black panther is great example none of this was part of the story it was pupils entertainment and followed chronicle of batman vs superman and justice leagueif dc really wants to compete with marvel then they need to focus on these aspectsand for gods sake please keep your uniqueness dont try to sumulate marvel comics,fantasy
visually just stunning piece of art sure its cgi heavy but what did you expect from a superhero movie that is based in underwater atlantis practical effectsplot was long and is expertly paced the very last 30 minutes are little crammed with lots of big things happening but im glad they did give space for characters to grow and bond the whole treasure hunt was really nice little subplot that made everyone more relatablecostumes are just amazing they are almost exact duplicates from comics and they do not look silly at all how they did it maybe its the environment that makes them blend in and seem realisticsome single shots are little cringe worthy like those that emphasizes how badass jason momoa is little less of that would have worked bettergenerally speaking this is a great movie however i was little overwhelmed how much spectacle this movie had and the ending was too crammed with amazing action and visuals that is why i give this 810 instead 910,fantasy
the bada few arguably bad writing choices to expedite the script and keep it under 3 hourscostume design mostly related to the cheese factor of enemy soldiersdiscombobulated editing in a few spots that made some folks confuseda few cheesy linessome unnecessary sequences that couldve cut 1020 minutes out and not be misseda bit of bad over acting thankfully its very limitedthe post processing of youngification of parents shouldve cast younger actors for the early years the work felt a bit unnecessarybad guys werent complex or deep enough dont expect to identify with any of them like you may have with someone like thanos for examplethe goodgood balance between a tad of humor and more serious story notesgreat casting choices for jason as male lead and amber as female leadvery colorful  good quality vfx felt like pirates of the caribbean meets underwater avatar with a pinch of riddick  star wars to go with a blade runnerish soundtrackno cheesy or forced love storytons of action mixed in with some slower paced sequences to allow for character developmentgood supporting castunderwater sound fx and tracks were fununderwater shots were balanced very well sometimes looking gigantic in scale but feeling very claustrophobic when neededunderwater hair looked greatmain character costumes looked decent and not as cheesy as the soldiersoverallwent in with low expectations because it was dc and this wasnt wonder woman or another chris nolan batman movie came out pleasantly surprised really fun flick 810,fantasy
ive been a fan of jason momoa since his days as ronon dex on stargate atlantis he has come a long way from those daysafter the dc disappointment that was batman vs superman this was refreshing momoa has made his own i enjoyed all the chemistry between the actors momoa especially used his signature humor to add that extra charm to arthur curry i was blown away by performance of patrick wilson as orm marius patrick ive always found to have a great range as a performerthe movie from beginning to end had great flow i walked in with no expectations i found the movie to have excellent direction from james wan right down to the music by rupert gregson williams your in for a real treat with this movieas far as flaws go it had some slow points that are to be expected however the character building was quite excellent i even really enjoyed a lot of the supporting characters as well the film had a nuance a lot of super hero movies seem to lackif dc keeps to this kind of quality i look forward to many more great films hopefully they can translate this into a new batman and superman as far as im concerned those movies were garbage as fans we deserve better films like,fantasy
theyve tried to pack way too much in this movie storywise but the lead actor is one of those rare discoveries like gal gadots wonder woman regardless of how much cheesiness he has to deliver he does it with style highly recommended and looking forward to the sequel,fantasy
 was great wonderful to see dc release a fun and bright movie i enjoyed the vast majority the only parts that could have been left behind on the cutting room floor was the manta characterso manta and dear old dad are pirates murdering pirates yes murderers saves what remains of the submarienes crew but does not save mantas dad from being stuck under heavy wreckage and imminent drowning manta then grunts under breath bad must die and now is supposed to be someone we think of as a villain for this character and we are supposed to care he wants revenge for the death of his pirate murdering dad who tried many times to killorry manta you are not a sympathetic character neither was your dad what your dad got was karma to quote jim carey from liar liar stop breaking the law cant use expletives on imdb then dear old dad would not have diedyay nicole kidman was great i have also it been an amber heard fan but she did great as well i thought she was well suited for the role,fantasy
i went to see this film with medium to high expectations after reading some stellar reviews on imdb i would advise checking the date more closely because dceu are clearly using the reviews before release as a guerilla marketing campaigndont get me wrong there are some saving graces some of the scene design in this film is wonderful atlantis looks stunning and some of the fight scenes are entertaining to watch however there is inconsistency in how well underwater scenes are rendered and it does sometimes lend itself to videogame cut scene territory also some of the costume design looks straight out of oldschool power rangers which im not sure is a good thing for multimillion pound productionwhere the film suffers most however is in the the godawful dialogue if youre a fan of overblown cheesy declarations this film is for you if you wanted something more punchy and impactful this film is not i heard a couple of audible groans from the audience at a couple of points after the characters make wooden use of already cheesy lines and it really is almost laughablejason mamoa does his best with the material given and he really looks the part nonetheless though he struggles to deliver on some of the more cheesy moments where he is required to emote something more than cool surfer man im unsure if this is due to the bad lines given poor direction or due to limited ability the baddies are a bit forgettable and could have used better motivations over all mantis was given one but was underused and a bit ridiculous reallyin summary i wouldnt pay to watch this film and i wish that i hadnt read the real user reviews folks check dates and stick to the mcu i guess because apart from wonder woman this dceu is simply not up to par,fantasy
my suggestions forgo read his origin story before watching his movie or before making a postor just go with an open mind not looking to critic itthis is a really good moviei watched it on imax 3d it got a standing ovationi decided to try 2d to seei even enjoyed it moreit tells a story of global warming a regular guy standing up to greatnessit tells a story of love i loved that the jokes werent too much and at times you could feel arthurs pain of being alonejames wan did an amazing job and i loved the peter jacksons adventure film style usedto me this is up there with batman begins  i also prefer it to wonder woman by a land mileoverall id give it a very good 8remembering that 10 means perfect and 9 cos i wanted to see more tragedy and deathand yesjason momoa isarthur curryamber heard is mera and a lovely side kickthat last kiss was one to watch for again,fantasy
very good film overall  minor kinks such as some parts were very cringeworthy coupled with some bad acting all in all a very good film and a step in the right direction for the dceu,fantasy
after the flops that were suicide squad 2016 and batman v superman 2016 a lot of dc fans like myself felt a bit weary around dcs new film would bring dc to justice and save their new liveaction library well im glad to say that this definitely delivers i saw this in theatres with my dad and i didnt look away it had a lot of action scenes that were put together really well and the water was someof the best effects in years the two main leads are wonderful though i do think they could have given himself more brains than brawn i do love the actress who plays mera and she does give a really convincing performance but i do feel like they were a bit pushy with her action scenes overall an actionpacked adventure from the kings of comics dc,fantasy
first of all please excuse me for my english i watched this movie due to the box office ratings and reviews the cinematography the visuals and the cgi all that were spectacular however i would want to see a remake of in a more legendary and nature setting where do you have the underwater kingdom under the great ocean of the earth and all those troops and the technology this sounds ridiculous instead of a load of cgi and all those fighting that stuff your brain i want to see more human elements it could be like when the aqua kid realized he was different how he could communicate with the marine life and how he try to fit in or stride a balance between the land and sea then evolve to the need to protect marine life by working with the humans all that plus do you need fins and grills to swim like that i am a grown up and i think this movie is more for the kids in the middle of the movie i was like am i watching guardians of the galaxy and star wars come on i like super hero but please make it more legendary for people to remember this character thats why the movie shape of water is successful because the only cgi is the eyes of the amphibian man thank you,fantasy
a must watch movie awesome graphics and animations good story wont let you get bore from start till end,fantasy
a decent goodlooking film a charismatic character and goodaction flick the biggest disappointment is the script which is a joke,fantasy
not as bad as they said but also not as good as they said underwater special effect and beaches is amazing that one good point the fight  war scenes is better then bvs or justice league but thats it the story is very poor the titled should be national treasure trident of poseidon not enough time to develop many of this creatures back story even for itself mamoa is soso amber heard is just pretty like she played in every of her movies no acting skill whatsoever manta is copied from power rangers with the eyes of cyclops from xmen patrick wilson is loki with the jaws army dc still not yet have good villain with the charisma to become the good movie like heath ledger joker at the dark knight anymore all better villain should be cgi characters the soundtrack is so lousy and cheezy and the timing of it ruin the mood instantlynote having only good special effect can wow you in very short period only because in the future it will come new and better of it the special effect will always improve thats why if you see top movie list anywhere even at imdb list not many movies with only special effect on the list for long and if they are on the list i sure you it because they have very good story,fantasy
if youre looking for a trill of a ride and you want to spend some time in another world this is the perfect film for you,fantasy
i must say i enjoy this movie a lot theres some scenes that could be a lot better visually and some stuped parts like the octopus playing the drums but overall is a cool movie with a new story with movies like wonder woman and this one dc could be very different  sorry to say the new batman messed everything up,fantasy
almost 212 hours of too much cgi for a king arthur sword in the stone story it was far too much cgi overly dramatic music which repeated throughout the entire film there was way too much were killing the planet messaging in this movie my kids didnt even like it boys 12 and 14 dc is just pumping out junk because of the popularity of superhero movies right now the best scene in the movie is when they are in sicily they did a good job in that scene only of mixing the cgi and real life,fantasy
summary its another movie that is best experienced in theatres definte watch at least once fyi there is one end credit scene before the long end credits is the latest movie from dc comics that strays away from being a setup for another movie in the future it stands together as a solid movie with heart stunning visuals and actions sences that are extremely cinematic but its not without its cheesy momentspros himself had a good arc and although a little underdeveloped mera makes an awesome debut same can be said for black manta who is the standout character of the movie with a good motivation for doing what he does and what he will continue to docons ocean master aka king orm the main villian has some great scenes and some motivation that does not really blossom into something meaningfulthe movie can get a little cheesy especially with those close upsall in all as ive said its a solid movie that stands on its own something that cannot be said for dcs previous endeavours along with wonder women and dc seems to be heading in the right direction,fantasy
we saw the movie on christmas day and it was a pleasant present there was a lot of action great story some funny lines excellent acting etccant wait to see this again,fantasy
epic cgiepic castepic storyepic adventure  its like indiana jones and dc made a babyjames wan youre killing me loved it so much,fantasy
i was reluctant to see the movie due to the review of many critics that did not like it but decided to buy my ticket and i was not regretfulthis movie is what dc needs we have a real superhero that saves people from dying but also lets the villains die he is like a human and not like marvel heroes that are portrayed as disney princesses all good and rosiethe visuals are amazing making a movie under water is very challenging and kudos to wan and his team for creating a brilliant world underwater with cgi technologystoryline was decent and despite what many critics said the movie is too long i could not feel the time pass since the movie is packed with actionthe only thing i would change is perhaps adding less elements to the movie dinosaurs were clearly an unnecessary add onthis movie is a must watch and a breath of fresh air from the marvel universe that delivers the same over and over,fantasy
when i first heard that this movie was coming out i was too excited for words now that i have seen it i have never been more low key dissatisfiedlet me start off where the movie itself started off the conception of tom curry father looked like a cartoon they were trying to make him look younger and it looked like a similar past mistake like the horrendous mustache however looking at all the other cgi with minor mistakes that make it look completely awful it looked very very good just being underwater was incredible because we really do know more about mars than our own oceans therefore it was welcoming to see how the underwater features would work and they definitely worked wellnow lets talk about the script this was one of the most laziest scripts and quite predictable a 6 year old would quite enjoy this movie cause he wouldnt have to think at all however a knowledgeable person would get considerably bored,fantasy
im a fan of momoa but without him this movie is just spy kids for adults the writing was terrible the story was garbage and the comedy was not thought throughoutside of the christian bales batman wonderwoman is the best dc film is 2 but only because of momoa i didnt have high hopes for this but it was better than i thought it was going to be the tragedy is that it could have been so much better if they would have followed the feel of wonderwoman and had a strong story and stronger writingthe visuals are impressive very impressivego watch the movie just dont expect greatness,fantasy
this movie was one of the best movie i have seen till now but not the best jasons acting was great black manta proved to be a better villain than the ocean master visuals were excellent i was really stunned to see such great visuals,fantasy
the visuals were stunning no doubt about itbutstory could have been predicted within the first half hourcharacter development was clicheeverything was too darn easybe it defeats those in his path easily  or  figuring out the clue in the deserter kingdomor dislodging the trident from the hand of the kingeverything fell into place too neatlythe movie was ridden with cliche dialogue and forced laughter momentswent in with high hopes after seeing the ratings but was utterly disappointed,fantasy
if i wrote all day i might not finish telling how much i liked about this movie ive heard several times in the last few years that the character of from the past was lame i realize maybe im not the average audience member because i liked him a lot in the animated justice league of my 70s childhood and my youngest who strongly preferred bearded and i both agreed that this was an excellent updated and both thought this would work for very nearly any type of audiencethe movie making ensemble that made this fab show did far better than many superhero movies do in not frustrating or confusing people who actually like comic books or previous screen interpretations it showed just whats so great in comic books which we refer to in our house as the moments this had good writing acting directing editing etc there were grand visuals and the whole thing just swung along from one great moment to another with good and sometimes awe inspiring transitionsand heres my own odd bit i have a weird quirk where even though i like certain types of action movies in recent years i tend to accidentally tune out fight scenes its truly not intentional but its sometimes so thorough that i miss something just after a fight that mattered i guess they often bore me and often seem to me to have pretty ridiculously poor choices in how they are filmed but i actually didnt have that problem in this movie my family would say that was a very positive commentary on the movieits not that there are no criticisms that could be made by those who seriously enjoy critiquing but from my point of view just wanting movies to entertain me and this movie reaching a very high level of entertainment value it just isnt worthwhile to do anything other than to focus on the positive,fantasy
this movie fulfills all of your imagination of how you want this movie to go it fulfills everything you want this movie to be  does it perfectly i dont care if some ppl say this movie is a cliche predictable plot  stuff i havent watched a movie like this one which so perfectly scratches an itching spot thank you for the amazing experience i will keep supporting this just so that the creators would have enough revenue to make a film just like this once again,fantasy
i think make dc better  cant wait for next dc film,fantasy
totally enjoyable acting was superb lots of fun special effects for great theres only two movies this year that ive enjoyed and venom dcs doing a superb job,fantasy
i normally dont like superhero movies but takes itself with a grain of salt solidifying its place as a fun bombastic film with some new takes on superhero action from director james wan,fantasy
what a great movie from the storyline characters fighting scenes and graphics the best dc movie to date,fantasy
i amazed with the cgi its so epic i know its hard to make underwater battle so i appreciate what james wan created the stroy is so epic for me and i recommend you giys this watch this movie,fantasy
by far the best decu movie to date and just a notch below tdk winter soldier infinity war civil war avengers i would put it on par with iron man black panther thor ragnarok ww and the first guardians by thats just my opinion my only gripe is that there wasnt enough black manta,fantasy
i was skeptical at first but this movie held its own from start to finish it was entertaining and funny the story does drag a little but definitely finishes strong,fantasy
my expectations for were kept pretty low to me as a dc fan hes barely considered second string hero and the idea of bringing him to the big screen seemed like an insurmountable task there are a few things they did very right with this film its pure science fictionfantasy so they use that to their advantage they did similarly with this what they did with the second and third thor movies where there is very little realism here so they can take liberties with nearly anything the cgi is extravagant and well done the film is a visual sight to behold which helps a lot james wan as director is a talented solid director with great vision and this is a bit different for him but he knows how to tell a story and the fantasy visuals needs a story and it works there were scenes throughout this that i kept thinking should have been nearly completely laughable it was so cheesy but it worked within the confines of the fantasy of the filmjason momoa is a great choice for arthur because hes a far cry from the comic book version momoa has great charisma on screen and im really starting to enjoy him as an actor hes massive and larger than life and yet there is something very down to earth about it amber heard is the eye candy in the movie and the romantic interest though that is mostly played down heard does decently shes not an amazing actress by any means but she serves her purpose and her and momoa are okay together patrick wilson is a nice addition to the cast although i found his character very cheesy at times even his line delivery is not exactly serious enough to take seriously but he is a decent villain to the story nicole kidman is also a nice addition to the cast as mother she looks amazing and she definitely adds a certain gravitas to the film dolph lundgren willem dafoe yahya abdulmateen ii graham mctavish and temuera morrison all have strong supporting roles you can tell by the big names they signed to this that on screen charisma helped carry the film a lotjames wan created a fantasy epic and thats an important distinction to your typical superhero flick its very watchable its light and fluffy and its nonstop action the action scenes will literally have you on the edge of your seat and that helps you ignore the silliness or the oneliners or the cheesy moments and dialog it ends up working quite well i dont think this is the best dc universe film by any means and i dont think it comes even close to wonder woman but i think it does well given that its id be surprised to see them pull this off again but if they follow the same recipe and have the same amount of experience behind the camera and in front then maybe it is clear now that being without zack snyder is still the best for the dc universe 7510,fantasy
 is ridiculous and over the top and a bit insane and its fun so so so much fun absurd levels of fun has people riding giant seahorses and sharks and firing lasers it has a polynesian man living in maine a queen played by nicole kidman a king played by dolph lundgren and a prince named orm played by patrick wilson its packed with mythology and world building and action scenes and a hunt for a mystical thing and stuff going boom it has both pitbull and roy orbison on the soundtrack and it has an octopus drum solo and julie andrews voicing a sea monster the size of cthulhu,fantasy
unexpectedly a nice movie a bit predictable but nice nice effects funny and a good amount of action,fantasy
i hate it when they withhold a movie for a holiday release so they have the potential to make more money if a company decides to do then they better give me something to make the wait worthwhile in this case they didnt come through for me i was anticipating something betteri will say i kind of liked this movie but i expected more it left me feeling kind of disappointed i think they sacrificed too much of the story for more action it felt like they were trying too hard to include too much for 1 movie i think it might have been better served splitting it up into 2 parts but then it wouldnt have been as exciting this movie really needed a good writer someone who could have condensed the story into something that flowed more smoothly the dialogue was at times silly and out of place momoa trying to be funny is like arnold schwarzenegger trying to be funny as the terminator awkward momoa is a great straight man he has good comedic timing and had some really funny moments in stargate atlantis when he wasnt trying to be funny if they wanted humor in this movie they should have used the same technique vs using corny jokesmaybe because im older and grew up watching movies with incredible actors and dialogue but the cgi stuff doesnt impress me that much some of it was incredible some of it was just off and made the scenes look fake i knew it was cgi and what they were showing was inaccurate it took me out of the movie i admire the movies that use cgi but dont make me aware of it there were times i wished id had a remote control so i could fast forward through parts that were just way too drawn out i wasnt crazy about the music at times it didnt enhance the story and sometimes it was downright distracting i think the music and background noises were overpowering making it more difficult to understand what was being saidi like momoa as an actor he is visually impressive but i still cant wrap my head around him being it was like he as an actor didnt believe he was nicole kidmans performance was not all that believable either maybe it was the cgi or lack of great dialogue but it didnt pull me in the antagonists were the worst their lines were laughable im reminded of a quote from wc fields if you cant dazzle them with brilliance than baffle them with bullst they tried to dazzle us with brilliant imagery so we didnt notice all the bullsti love super hero movies but the biggest problem i have with them is they try too hard to be epic yeah i want a hero and action but i want a good story as well too many times the story gets lost in the struggle to make it more epic than the last super hero movie i hate that theyre always trying to outdo each other with action and special effects at the cost of the story if you have a good story you dont need epic battles i think this movie really sacrificed story for action its like when you go to a buffet and you eat a little of everything but you dont get enough of the few really good things when you leave youre full but not satisfied although there were some great moments in the move it left me unsatisfied,fantasy
once again dc has failed at making a even decent movie horrible casting choices other than,fantasy
laughable i couldnt stop laughing at the ridiculous under water battles with sea horses and riding giant sharks warriors due battle i think some of these hollywooddirectors have completely lost touch with reality and are doing way too many drugscomic book heros was a distraction initially back when they came out with superman but like always hollywood latches onto anything that generates box office returns they will milk it to death the art of movie making has been lost to the computer age of cgi its all about special effects the age of movie goers now must be 12 and younger as for movie making continuing to be an art form its been lost decades ago as both directors and actors sell out for a fast buck in over hyped productions that cater only to those with the attention span of 5 seconds character development story line plot all rolled into on area the fight scene they dont even build up the suspense just drop you right into the violence right from the start and pretty much continues fight scene after fight scene with laughable sprinkles of emotional bonding between pretty girl and boys,fantasy
kids will probably enjoy this movie and if you have the hots for jason momoa youll probably love it but objectively its just not goodjason momoa is certainly easy on the eyes but he is just not a good enough actor to headline a blockbuster film tries to remedy this by padding his performance with other wellknown actors but its just not enough to fix this moviethe plot of the movie itself isnt terrible but the script is filled with weak dialogue and most of the characters cant seem to use contractions so that makes the dialogue seem very wooden and awkwardthere are a few nods to the from the comics and the old cartoons that fans will enjoy but there are other parts of the movie like a drumplaying giant octopus that will make viewers scratch their headsand of course dc still looks amateurish and cartoony when it comes to comparing their cgi to marvel movies not only in action sequences but also when it comes to deaging actorsbottom line take the kids to see it but keep your expectations low,fantasy
i hated it so much its a ripoff of black panther in which bp was a all time blockbuster and nailed it dc fans be cheating on the stars for the movie they all crazy go marvel spend your goddamn money on captain marvel endgame and far from home dc extended universe sucks,fantasy
and this is his origin story that has never seen before you see familiar faces and not so familiar faces actors cool action and cgi thats it overall f4rt,fantasy
the story was terrible i honestly have to believe that anyone who says this was a great movie has been paid,fantasy
this movie justifies the addition of a zero stars rating or even minus numbers what a dog i feel terrible for nicole kidman and willem dafoe two really great actors who apparently are past their commercial prime and have to take gigs in drivel like this the story what there is of it is a mishmash of all previous titles in its genre plus a hell of a lot of water every cliche in the book is employed and how the actors kept a straight face while delivering some of these lines is astonishing one would have to be a 10 year old boy on the verge of puberty to enjoy this flick just for the skintight mermaid outfits on the female characters compared to this movie waterworld is a masterpiece,fantasy
take some avatar aesthetic the roof chase from bourne ultimatum costumes from batman and robin stolen ideas from the fifth element and so many other shameless plagiarism not even hommage and you get nothing original here not even nicole kidmans face add to that the stupidest dialogues ever that try to pass as tongue in cheek a heavy dose of frat humour an abyssal void of substance supported but uninterrupted grandiose music that tries to make us feel something for the shell of characters and you got a 230 yes a 230 empty cheap looking cgi mess if i ever see underwater flowy hair fx and hear another bloop bloop sound that reminds us that they actually are speaking under water even they know its stupid because they take time to underline how senseless it is to no other than himself well ill start throwing all my garbage directly in the ocean to show my disgust and hopefully choke with plastic in the process,fantasy
one of the best movies i have ever seen not a single issue with it the special effect were unreal and the story was so easy to follow and just an all round 10 out of 10 movie if i could give it more stars i would,fantasy
rubbish script cgi acting  directionnot as bad as justice league but thats it,fantasy
packed with a lot of fighting scene background stories of and the sea world love stories realistic view about what we as the surface residence have done to the sea great acts and outstanding visuals i really love how they depict the sea world mix between fantasy and high technology it feels so magical you can feel how much effort they gave for the visuals every fine details in it is so captivatingyou can also love all the characters in it even the villains or at least you cant really hate em why because even though they are the villains they have reasons of why they do what they do even though it is still wrong i think you cant really hate what they doi think james wan did amazing job to bring on the screen also i think you can pick several morals in life throughout the movie for ex even if you make mistakes in the past you can always be a better person in the futureanyway wait until the end they have postcredit scene for you to watch,fantasy
i felt like this film had potential based on the other films so far you try to keep an open mind because this time it might be differentultimately the movie gets bogged down in far too much distracting cgi including hollywoods penchant for making its stars look younger in flashback segments particular cgi and effects that bothered me were the shimmer to make it look like they were underwater and a filter on their voices to make it sound like talking with a mouth full of waterat times this film felt like a cross between national treasure and the sword in the stone while jason momoas stumbles around with a brah attitudei thought this film had the potential to break away from the earlier dc movies be a bit different and set its own bar but it has ended up another longwinded disappointing chapter in the dc franchise,fantasy
i went into this movie with a open mind and i was disappointed the first opening scene was promising and well directed but the rest of the movie fell flat with cringe moments noticeably bad cgi terrible jokes silly jump scares and pacing issues james wann the director is very good dont get me wrong but he was either not 100 sure on what he was doing here or the studio was pulling strings most of the time the movie has all the typical cliches which usually i let pass but these ones you could see coming from a mile away and just make you sighthe actors arent bad but the script they are given here is awful some of the lines are so bad they look improvised at the last second the scene in the desert is a great example of this every line sounds like it was written by a 10 year old with a bad sense of humourthe good points here are that the villains have motivations which are clear but mostly cliche the actions scenes are quite badass especially the submarine scene but thats where it endsoverall i think this movie should have been short and sweet making us want more instead i never want to see another solo movie the post credit scene is pointless and sparks no emotion or excitement for any future instalments,fantasy
action is good pace of the movie is good dialogue is mediocre story is ok if youre into superhero movies definitely go see it but it isnt the best youve seen enjoyable nonsense,fantasy
dc will comeback from marvel with this movie,fantasy
 movie full of business movie element and cannot tell the whole story well i have to admit it that wan is very talented he know how to use elements to attract audiences nicoles 45s long camera fighting scene thriller elements hero moment fantastic camera and highly restored comic character settings which can attract comic fans but a good movie need to use these elements to tell the story right to decorate the movie in stead of steal the storys thunder the film originally had a very clear main line but it was influenced by the cumbersome elements of the story especially those hero moment the film is about the growth of so there should be only one real hero moment that is when he gets the kings trident however this seems to be posing from beginning to end but the real hero time is inferior because by then the audience has been tired of watching him pose,fantasy
the movie is awesomethe acting is greatthe action rulesthe music is great this is honestly the best dc movie ever and i really dont understand why all those haters are posting their wrong reviews so many times on the same pagerelax guys we know how to read theres no need for this kind of childish reactions,fantasy
if you have a brain between your ears do not go seepossibly the worst movie ive ever seenbad writingbad acting and stupid plotwellkal drogo jason mamoa does okayhe plays it for what it issillybut the guy who was the owl in watchman plays the badguy and hes terribleand omgamber heard is so bad and stupid in that bright red hair you just want to shoot her willem dafoe is in it hes in a lot of bad movieshe was in platoonbut he really sucks in thisor his lines suckeither waywhen this comes to videoand it will or should  like tomorrowdont bother,fantasy
this movie is so dumbed down it is an insult to the film industry every line is corny the story line could have been okay but is executed in such a formulaic way that it provides nothing except  yes of course that would happen now in this script every piece of music feels like it was created by someone with zero subtlety who received a c in music for film 101 it might appeal to 8 years olds and below,fantasy
i havent been that bored in a movie in a long time the visuals were great but no depth to the story at all it was the motions going on a ride not really sure why i was on the ride most of the movie whoever is in charge of storytelling did a terrible job it doesnt take much but you need to make the characters real relatable and packed with emotion this was a cheap thrill that could have been a lot morethe atlantis world was cool but all these people giving this a 1010 are out of their minds,fantasy
i havent seen this yet but the origin story sounds very suspiciously like the sword in the stonei hope they gave credit to thomas malory and t h whiteill write a full review after ive seen the movie,fantasy
as an avid cinema and movie enthusiast never have i seen such utter rubbish plot was thin and jumpy acting mediocre at best left the showing half way through worst film everdo not watch dc universe need a complete revamp,fantasy
if you want to watch a terrible movie this is it i dont even want to go into details cause i am trying to forget i spent money to go watch this but here it comes costumes are terrible character building is nonexistent i mean black manta is a satire all the way the helmet that wouldnt allow a person to see anything the stupidest motivation ever the sudden techgenius skill level the only worse thing is the things they made patrick wilson and willem defoe do they are such great actors and here they were brought to do their acctual lowest its sad its even sadder dc and wb excecitives allowed that to happen damage control department is off the charts with the positive reviews everywhere they are all lies if you go and see the movie youll know its bad its terrible its waaay worse than even green lantern with ryan reynolds its just bad nothing redeems this movie i will try to get the message to everyone just dont watch this its a waste of your time if you stare at white wall for 3 hours thats a time well spent comparing to this movie,fantasy
95 cgi and super cheesy action sequences were entertaining but was hoping for that dark dc theme i would watch it again but pretty disappointed all in all,fantasy
far better than marvels avenger infinity war visual effects is awesome including directionactingaction sequence cinematographystory etc full entertainment package,fantasy
going through some of the ratings somehow makes me doubt the legitimacy of these ratings among the dc heroes has one of the most promising potential after wonder woman but it was a total disappointment did i have high expectation for it before watching not really i enjoyed the first 2030 mins of the movie but the movie quickly took me down the sewer with too many cliches bad lines horrible costume designs and dated choice of musicmusic  if the musics were used in superheroes movies in the 90s its probbaly acceptable many scenes make you wonder if they have a music director of some sort in the production team or they just have some intern working on it perhaps a real intern would do a better jobcostume design  omg i laughed at it initially but it later became a pain just to watch another second of those bad designs if batman still wears the costumes from the 60s he would look like a clown than a superhero you can improvise you know black mata looks like an idiotdialogues and lines  cheesy lame and lack of effort youre not a king youre a hero seriously thats the best line you can think of,fantasy
this was an amazing movie dc is back baby,fantasy
this movie is amazing its beautiful action packed suspenseful hilarious and heartfelt saw it in 3d and plan to see it in imax next,fantasy
this movie has everything humour horror comedy romance lots and lots of fun and action of epic proportions should appeal to both children and those children at heart,fantasy
i was a little bit scary to see itsince justice league and batman vs superman was not a wow movie for mei wait until someone to see itand wow good actiongood introduction for this character since never had a moviescenery of atlantis awesomewonder woman and man of steel were the other awesome movies from dcfor me,fantasy
 is a movie that deserves to be loved the way james wan told the story was incredible and the acting was also quite natural and on the top the vfx and cgi was that good that ive never seen before i love this movie for me this is the best movie of 2018,fantasy
this is the dceu movie that we have been waiting for is an absolute blast jason momoa owns the role willem dafoe is solid as always amber heard patrick wilson nicole kidman and dolph lungren are great additions there is a lull in the middle of the film but story wise and visual wise this movie delivers is my favorite superhero movie this year i cannot wait to purchase this movie on 4k fingers crossed that wb has learned from their mistakes with suicide squad and justice league and well be getting more great dc movies like,fantasy
stunning visuals the story ripped away from the comic and so are the costumes for every character couldnt have taken the story any better hats off to james,fantasy
after watching this movie no words to describe the story cinematography action scenes directing and performance of the cast and how beautifully visualized and presented this,fantasy
the movie offers everything u wantnot even a single part of the movie was boaringfantastic work or art you vl enjoy every bit of it,fantasy
i really loved watching it once more ratings of rt and mc are so wrong how could you rate so low this movie and then praise avengers infinity wars critics are digging their own tomb with this one disney pays so much,fantasy
this was only ok visuals were stunning story had potential came off to forced to me like has to be a hardcore bad dude in every line he utters tried too hard black mantas suit while faithful needed an update he looked ridiculous too many over the top cheesey lines,fantasy
its not bomb as justice league but its good dc wasted the potential of the best interesting character plot is good but movie is linear dc should learn from marvel,fantasy
just saw imax3d blownaway out of the world vfx uber cool 3d shots jasonmamoa  class apart one of the best dceu has to offer after wonderwoman slick action scenes amberheard is awesome,fantasy
one of the best and the most awesome and complete superhero movie of all time being a marvel fan i seriously loved this movie to the core jason momoa u were born do this superhero movie guys never even dare to miss it ,fantasy
with all the hype and expectations to be honest this movie did not live up to the standards  and wait this isnt just another dc movie it is something else an improvement we might say  the story line and the character buildup is good  the cast and the direction is wonderful but the horror movie wan touch is still there and quite works out  the graphics have improved a lot from the previous dc movies  yet the movie is placed in a bad timeline to say  a mistake of the studio  an origin story placed after the events of jl is very odd and less entertaining the movie is quite slow and a definite one time watchable ,fantasy
saying that this movie is the best dc movie is rediculous since the justice league and batman vs sup are terrible and clearly theyre not counting nolans movies which put this one to shame as well that being said has ang lee a compliment director as well as a few good actorsjust a few and plenty of action to keep the viewers from dozing offthis movies biggest flaw is its completely unoriginal its inyourfaceobvious that the writers all got together and took their ideas from thor black panther iron manspecifically pt 2 indiana jones star wars and tron legacy its all on the screen and so many times i found myself saying thats right out ofthe visuals are definitely good and the action was funsometimes i love action but these felt forcedthis movies second biggest flaw are the villains and dc clearly tried really really hard to make these villains good sorry you failed again the main villain is the heros half brother who wants the thrown sound familiar and though hes played by patrick wilson and well his story is just too cliched in other words weve seen it before the second villain was downright terrible with an awful story line an awful costumewhich is supposed to be an upgrade and such a stupid name you can call me black manta what everyone in the room groan at that line at least black panther looked like a black panther and was badass this guy looks like a cross between a blackmetallic iron managain ripoff and robbie the robot its a waste of time and he gives that line just moments before he diesthe fights between and the main villainwhos name i never caught were fun but again ive seen it before the story was very predictable there was no suspense and the nearendings twist was not a surprise at alloh and the cherry on the sunday of lame is the never ending preaching of how mankind is killing the oceans and the environment leave politics at home dammitoverall its definitely much better than the last few dc movies weve seen but its still a dc film and that says a lot about the films quality the money is definitely spent on screen and it looks great but i dont see what all the hype is about looking at some of these reviewsthis movie is not bad but its nothing compared to avengers end gamess trailer just the trailer of that is better than this,fantasy
idk what anyone else says this is so far the best action movie of the season creed 2 was good but this is such a different spin on the everyday reg super hero they are fighting massive battles riding great whites being surrounded by a million farrils and doing it all in this diffrent world under the sea its just amazing really is amazing i will say i love dolph lundgren making a big appearance as the king of one of the ocean relmes most of the characters were cast perfectly but they decided to go with a weird cast choice for the secondary villian he a modern day pirate his backstory is a little wacky though there primary villian auqamans estranged brother and prince of the ocean whom is trying to obtain the title ocean master and wants to wage waron the  land dwellers was an amazing cast choice it was allinall one of the most entertaining pictures ive watched in months,fantasy
this is the second time after i dissapointed by justice leaguehey theres no plot twist and the worst part is the the plot is very predictablehmmokay maybe this is better than justice leaguei believe dcu teams will be better sooni still wait the best superhero movies from dceukeep spirit guysthank you,fantasy
wait for cable spongebob was a better ocean movie,fantasy
firsti thought that i was going to see a superhero movie but after the movie i think that i was just going to see a treasure finding travel second all the music in this movie sucksi mean the point it starts or ends is all wiredand the fighting music didnt give a feeling of that it should be third and the last the whole story was just like the soap that my grandma watched in 80s,fantasy
this movie is visually stunning dont get me wrong the cgi is epic and gorgeous but its a ridiculously dumb movie jason mamoa is a stunning man that does an okay job as but his character feels very surface his opening sequencefight scene is a good intro but youre left wanting more depth to the character as the movie progresses they tried to add some toughness and snark like tony stark but theres not enough to work with to actually make the personality truly click and shine through to the audience amber herd was excellent as mera and i think she was perfectly cast and the most believable character in this filmpatrick wilsons character was tolerable as the lead villain i dont have much more to say on him yahya abdulmateen ii was a minor bad guy character as he became black manta i had to hold in giggles as his battle armor made him look like more like a cheesy bad guy from the 90s version of mighty morphin power rangers and less like a marvel antagonist so much of this movie just reminded me of avatar only underwater avatar had mystery to it as it wasnt a world we knew but this has very recognizable animals in it that are awkward to see in their presentation for instance sharks in battle armor frickin sharks with frickin laser beams on their heads austinpowers seeing orcas and blue whales presumably miles underneath the ocean was also something difficult to just dismiss as its just movie science as these are real animals in our worldthe underwater scenes particularly the entry into the city of atlantis were beautifully done however the inexplicable lack of continuity between how physics works in this underwater world falling off of cliffs underwater among other nonsense towards the end of the movie had all of us in the preview audience muttering shifting in our chairs and asking aloud many of the same questions we wanted to much to love this movie and everyone walking out said it was terrible but the cgi was amazing i wish i could say i loved it i didnt beautiful but disappointing movie,fantasy
conceptually the movie is just like an ordinary fairy tale visually it is like a new skin for plenty of wellknown templates the story thread s obvious and expectable it is truly hard to find reasons for watching this however it has also not got any critical drawbacks and enough acceptable thing to see,fantasy
let me start out by mentioning this movie was visually stunning but lacked a lot when it came to good back stories and villain motivationfirst of all the cool looks and lame jokes in the beginning of the movie are way too forcedthere are two villains frog man and the atlantians that want to destroy the earth dwellers the motivation of the frog men to kill is not at all explained and then they give you the simple reason that declined to save his father  lets take a look at why he didnt save him1 criminal daught in the act2 first showed mercy after getting blasted by an explosive bullet3 decided to let him die after he threw a grenade at when he was on his way out then died because the submarine collapsed on himselfok atlantis people never even tried to negotiate the end of sea pollution or prove their presence to the earth dwellers so their motivation to attack is not at all reasonable since earth dwellers have no idea they are harming an entire civilization of humanoidslastly there are so many inconsistencies and bending of logic that it all feels very forced and set upits an entertaining movie with stunning visuals but its not a good movie and it lacked an overarching score like the one in the mcuoh and what the hell was the rocky training montage scene where frog man builds his suit that was so cringe to be honest almost all the music in this movie was cringelastly what did the fbi agent from ant man do in the dcu hes even gonna be in the sequel,fantasy
the opening scenes the makup on the father awfulthe acting of kidnan consudering she is a oscar winner awful very good comedic timing i think he played it for funoverall the cgi was over the top the evil brityer was lamesomehow australias film industry certainly know how to create a flop from a certain winner4510for true super heto fans,fantasy
you should have filmed much better than thisthere is no connection from every scene to scenei wished and watch this movie was good enough like wonder womanhowever it sucks as justice league,fantasy
i am a big fan of james wan his direction is great and that why i have given 2 star other then that movie was flat cgi cgi and cgi better watch warcraft animations then these too much overlay colors etc but i must admit they should continue making solo movies these are little better then the justice league stuff good work they will grow in next 30 or 40 years,fantasy
wow one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time clearly demonstrates what marvel has over dc in the cinematic universe suffers from weak storytelling a poor script and terrible dialogue incompetent directing and some very poor casting choices i have not seen jason momoa in game of thrones maybe he is excellent in that but he is unwatchable in delivering his lines in a contrived shallow manner maybe this is not entirely his fault given how bad the dialogue is even nicole kidman could not deliver hers with any enthusiasm or sincerity momoa speaks almost every line of dialogue with two dimensional cocky bravado and his character is basically developed as a rather dim surfer dude all of which i gather is supposed to be humorous whereas marvel despite occasional flaws manages excellent storytelling in which the viewer feels invested develops characters with genuine personalities and conveys both genuine humor and pathos through those characters and that storytelling falls flat on every leveli understand the overall fun people have with superhero movies but that generalized enthusiasm should not extend to giving a movie this poorly made an average of 71 on imdb i dont know where people are getting this the one thing this movie has going for it is beautiful animation the fact that it looks like a video game and more literally resembles a cartoon is another factor which detracts from the overall effect but it sure is pretty to look at,fantasy
how did anyone give this good reviews jason momoa is the only reason i did not turn it off after 5 minutes the story line is very poorly tied together while it jumps very quickly from scene to scene it also provides very little explanation for what happens next im so disappointed,fantasy
im gonna make this really simple to decribe this film is if disneys  the little mermaid and ryan reynolds  green lantern had a love child so cringey youll have to shower afterwards,fantasy
i could totally tell the ending when just watch the beginning he could get the trident with no talent he lost when fighting with his brother john just got in the cave and said some emty stuffs not even needed to fight the monster,fantasy

let me start by saying that this is not the worst movie ever made i think the people who worked on it were actually trying however if not for james wans direction this movie would have a been a 210 it is a good looking movie and it is fun but its just bad the script probably being the main problem too many characters to introduce too many storylines going on at once and frankly just not very exciting super hero movies seem to feel the need to throw a joke into every scene but it is just distracting and not at all funny most of the time how people are giving this a 1010 which in my opinion should be reserved for only the best movies ever made i really do not know the acting is ok at best but i still cringed at the line delivery in some of the scenes im not trying to hate on this movie just trying to make sure you dont go into this movie with high expectations like i did becasue you will be let down one more thing the tones throughout the movie are very jumpy which leads to feeling like youre watching two different movies and it can be very irritating,fantasy
if you care about great acting dialogue and character development maybe this is not the movie for you james wan should stick with the jump scare horror movies because this movie was an embarrassment compared to his insidious seriesjason momoa scenery and the kraken maybe the only positives of this movie it also has a good message be humble a true king fights for everyone not only his peoplebut why the bad rating1 awful dialogue this movie is stuffed with cheesy one liners and horribly basic dialogue throughout this made it hard to really enjoy the movie i understand this movie is rated pg13 and mainly meant for children to see but it really could have been better2 bad acting the dialogue did make it hard for the actors to really shine with what they were given however the man who played black manta was not very good as a revenge character he just looked like a mad child and was unconvincing patrick wilson also disappointed in this movie nicole kidman did do a good job with the small role she was given though3 overuse of cgi the underwater scenery was good very glowy and spectacular like in avatar however the metal suit cgi was pretty bad much too shiny and unconvincing iron man did it better4 bad costumes queen atlanta mera and fish scale suits looked like they had been bought at a halloween store the sleeve ends showed too much and the scales looked like they had been drawn on some cgi could have been used here to add dimension to them5 romance where the romance between mera and seemed like an after thought just one scene showing real connection would have helped very flat and business like relationship she helps him he helps her and then they end up together somehowdespite all this the movie was an okay way to waste time and the children enjoyed it,fantasy
long time comic fan since the late 60s and very disappointed viewer the show was way to long with predictable dialog and choreographed fight scenes i felt like i had waited 2 hours for a battle the fight scene that everyone knew was coming 15 min into the film even the fight scenes were rushed almost as if the producers felt the show was getting slow so we better spruce it up with a cgi fight scene i definitely would not recommend this film unless you need a 2 hour nap,fantasy
this was a good dceu movie but a medicore movie i would expect more from to get some of the audience rating i have seen the acting is medicore sadly and the jokes werent evenly paced and seemed forced the action sequences were really good however the characters were not compelling at best for even dc fans this could maximum be 7 out of 10 anything higher i would question the reviewers judgement and honesty,fantasy
movies were filmed in location rarely in studios with human actresses and actors nowadays o hungry ridiculous paid indian in a semisubmersed basement flat using an outdated intel i3 pc produces a huge number of  men super hero films the producers pay nothing there are no actresses or actors nor technicians nor bests boys no humans at all but the humanoid apes push themselves to gain a prime seat in the hall so they can boast that they saw the masterpiece first imdb should have established absolute zero 273 for these things thank god i have seen to give you a hint rebecca and similar masterpieces and  as you may guess i quite old therefore i am extremely demanding from modern art rubbish is not art,fantasy
1this movie was like a cgi demo reel mixed with hair product comercials let me explain whythe cgi looks good and someone thought it would be a good ideea to have a 360 view of every cgi place so expect to be show a view of every location for now real reason its just there so they can show offno other reason secondly every woman in this movie is extraordinary clean and all the shoots focus on there hairis like a palmolive comerciali dont think they shoot on location at all2now on with the plotthe trailer shows every thingthe story is very poor and predictible and the dialog is extremly badthe actors had nothing to work withyou will see any plot twist comming from a mile awaythey try some jokes but they dont land most people sitting in the cinema were watching at the timebecause it was too boring3the music is bland end epicevery scene is treated with the same importance so the music is epic all the timeawsome right wrongjust dont see it i will be skiping dc movies from now on,fantasy
i wanted to love this movie but i cant say that i do the story is good the acting and soundtrack was not so good wish i wouldve waited for it on netflix,fantasy

if all you want plain action and millions of  in visuals this movie ia for youalas not for memovie has a weak plot and when that happens it gets predictableat least for me it does i could literally foresee what was gonna happen before it happenedand i mean everything movie feels like a 510 rated videogame and what you see its a predictable adventure mission of in search for a tridentthat my friends is the definition of a boring moviedc disappoints again the only dc movie i find enjoyable after christopher nolans batman trilogy is wonder womanon the counterpart mcu movies i cant say theres one i disliked dc is just bad at moviemaking p,fantasy
first everything that is ok about this film happened underwaterthe cgi seemed pretty good nice style good worldbuilding most of the acting was decent enough better from the more seasoned actors comedic moments sit a little awkwardly and were pretty flat for me but are probably not too bad the story was pretty simple but thats fine especially when executed by decent actingthe rest though everything out of the water its like someone completely different was in charge and its not goodtheres a long scene that looks like it came out of the old power rangers tv show with the same cheap look and a clunky villain who had suddenly become a technological genius just patheticthe soundtrack was mostly unnoticeable which i find is usually good except for horrible double use of the signature refrain during the first appearance but much worse two crude scene transitions into overbearing songs one of which starts a laughable scene that looks like the start of a disney fairytale musical numberthe cgi is bad including a scene on a boat that looks like they borrowed a backdrop from a film from the 1950s along with a camera stuck on maximum zoom for some reasonthere are other bits too when mera makes a speech all moving about for no reason but to clash with the tone of the moment or the wildly variable displays of strength or one underwater bit that was so silly illfitting and cheesy that our audience laughed out loud at itoverall the good bits are pretty decent but good grief i just dont get it youre watching then the next scene and youre wondering if they swapped the reels to another filmthis is not good filmmaking,fantasy
fantastic mindblowing well executed movie of the year the cg is a wow better than avengers infinity story is simple but executed very well by directorjason is a wow as i really give a hats off to the cast and crew for shooting so many scenes in reality under watera beautiful movie and thing is best to be watched in 3d,fantasy
little bit confusing with king orm haircut at the final movie suddenly short cut,fantasy
its boring seriously waste my 2 hours watching this why this movie is got full and dominate the amount of screening this movie in my country is beyond my imagination its filled by character i dont care about no character i can root because theyrejust feels not real and i cant relate to anything they talk and their action a fantasy doesnt mean you wont touch realism,fantasy
25 hours of my life i wont get back soooooo boring,fantasy
amber heard and patrick wilson are some of the worst actors ever,fantasy
i live in florida i was sitting with my wife on our lanai the other night when i told her this movie is hot trash what do i hear from the side of my house where the trash is kept and is invariably hot heeey no dont say that thats right even my hot florida trash didnt want to be compared to this moviegoodnight,fantasy
so much cheese cgi and fake underwater hair i really dont understand how this went so wrong it had a lot of potential is jason momoa is perfectly cast but its just a ps4 movie before the game starts really poor film and such disappointment from dc again,fantasy
magical rich ingenious innovative  a great film a great picturefresco absolutely sublime visuals its teeming with details and breathing expertise excellent music charismatic characters humor and also a beautiful message of love and humanitysimply a striking universe this is just my opinion huh  colorful costumes and armor because the film is a deluge of colors  textures which i personally love the construction of the film is coherent and the whole piece is really well thought out visually each plan makes an impression  i would say that it is a production that has confidence in its qualities and that puts each of its assets forward in a frisky  uninhibited way and of course action scenes fighting  battles  badass  big slap of awesomenessthen it is clearly also an adventure film in the pure sensejason momoa arthur and amber heard mera have a great complicity and everything about arthurs parents brings a great emotion to the story thats it  ,fantasy
cheesy cg terrible plot dialogue and acting im glad this was free from the library because im going to sleep through the rest while my 11 year old finishes the rest goodnight,fantasy
to say that is disappointing is an understatement the story takes every cliche youve ever seen in an action adventure film and marries it with superheroes none of these characters receive respect from the filmmakers the humor is forced the characters and story contradict themselves the cgi varies from amazing to bad the tone is inconsistent the soundtrackscore is incohesive this movie doesnt know if it wants to be man of steel or sharkboy and lavagirl overall this is an incredibly lazygeneric movie that is carried by an all star cast,fantasy
dc really needs to pick it up a few thousand notches if they keep this up they will loose all of their small fan base that is leftawful script poor acting even worse casting and a dreadful storyline even the music sucks big timehow this klich riddled turkey got 71 is beoynd me but i suspect dcbots,fantasy
why is this movie getting so much crediti went in with low expectations and came out disappointed stillit was a lousy script and some of the cgi was just terrible,fantasy
i will say a little but it will describe it all over all it was entertaining and no boring momens i was a bit distracted with the robot type people just felt it was star wars in the water  i must give the biggest credit to the director james wan with an amazing job fight scenes were not cliche and not too long and overlydone great execution to every detail of action scenes and surprise factor perfect visuals although the script is a bit cheesy for me the 2 hour movie never felt so long i was entertained till the end and good flow of movie with the climax very well executed  some movies dont have climax because everything is in climax and it just is overlydone and felt too much but this movie has a perfect timing  definitely a must watch movie  and dont believe the negative reviews which are mostly marvel fans  im not a marvel or dc loyalist fan  i basically love super hero movies this is one i can say bravo,fantasy
wow wow wow trust horror director james wan to take a superhero movie to an entirely different level this was so different to the other superhero movies out therefirstly blood hell the visuals are great the fighting scenes are brutal and violent jason momao is sensational as it simply wouldnt have been the same without him he is very natural and does the character justice i enjoyed the fact that the protagonist was also weak at times and vulnerable and not a super god is visually stunning atlantis is portrayed as a bright colorful breathtakingly beautiful place the costumes are incredible and cleverly incorporates marine elements the photography is also amazing and i absolutely loved the score i enjoyed the inclusion of the roy orbison song mystery girl in such a modern filmthe film is unpredictable and sometimes action abruptly ends tranquil moments unlike most marvel films the humor was at the right moments appropriate and actually funny for some reason i honestly believed i wouldnt enjoy believing it to be just another superhero been there done that movie i couldnt have been more wrong i absolutely loved it i loved the characters i loved the story i loved the entire production this was awesome,fantasy
i watched half of it and just couldnt stand anymore of this cringy crap how is anybody enjoying this bland mushy effects ridiculous story and action totally useless actors yuck,fantasy
this storyline is a little old to be honest i left before it was over my ex husband stayed so i went to a nearby moxies that happily had tequila in special that salty margarita almost made up for the less than stellar experience only rated so high because cinematically the colours were beautiful and the characters easy on the eyes,fantasy
just few things to say about this movie we want more we want more we want more fun lines magnificent battle scenes beautiful colors and delicious cgi the best dc movie so far,fantasy
this movie is completely over the topits clich corny has too much cg too many colors is weirdly paced so many explosions and screams and a childish plot but boy was it fun i had a grin on my face the whole timethe movie is completely self aware and actually manages to succeed with this lately overused trope it reminded me of dumb but amazing 80s action movies and the humor honestly surpasses many marvel moviesi did not expect this i expected a terrible movie considering the dceus track record man of steel batman v superman justice league and suicide squad were are terrible terrible horrible movies only wonder woman was pretty good this latest entry tops it,fantasy
the dialogue has got to be some of the worst ever written which results in horribly wooden acting casting was seriously flawed with the exception of jason momoa manta looks like a damn ant an altogether thoroughly ridiculous film that is far below the rest of the superhero films total disappointment,fantasy
everything about the film from how it looked to how it was done and the actors everything was amazing,fantasy
the film is very good the visual efects are the bests the actores are the best and the film is very imocionant,fantasy
i think the reviews are being too hard on this movie it has good effects two to three funny lines good fight scenes and a good cast basically pure entertainment its not like it deserves to win an oscar but it definitely deserves more than the poor ratings that it has gotvery enjoyable totally recommend,fantasy
finally dceu has given a worthy superhero movie and the character played by jason momoa is perfectly justifiable,fantasy
absolute brainless utter trash little mermaid is like oscar worthy performancs for this people are just dumb im done with dc and marvel for good,fantasy
i have seen a lot of bad movies this is the worst everything in this film sucks,fantasy
first dc film ive seen since the dark knight rises being a marvel fan this was disappointing and dull i feel like they overexplained everything single element of the story one liners were cringey i kept checking my watch and every time it seemed theyd come to a logical ending the film continued unnecessarily jason momoa carries the film in conclusion too long not enough action painful acting waste of time,fantasy
i cant express or voice my disappointment in any form or fashion besides simply saying this i expected a good movie based off of the 1010s on this site but was let down after the screening this film is essentially black panther another fairly average movie but killmonger and tchalla have switched rolesthe first and most important thing to address is the romance aqua man and ariel or whatever her name is have some of the most forced development i have ever seen they just stare at each other and hold handskiss to show they are falling in love they dont have a great dynamic or anything it just kind of happens because the movie wants it to happenanother thing to address is the costume design i feel like i could see these at a comic convention pretty solid for some random guy to design but terrible for a movie with this budget everything looks like plastic with scales engraved in them the worst part is the villains who arent atlantian you would think they couldve escaped the terrible costumes and they almost did then they come back dressed as one of the bad guys from power rangerssomething else i have to mention the clich of it all i know its a super hero film so its bound to have something familiar but nonetheless i hold this to the same standard as every other film the underdog story resembles that of something from a cars film a boxing movie a super hero movie or literally any movie with the protagonist loses first major stand off and becomes better to beat the villain the next time its a played out way of representing character development and conveying a story superhero movies have done without this logan the entire dark knight trilogy and watchmen to name a fewthe cgi its a dceu film thats all i have to saythe action scenes are glorious sarcasm i kid you not every five seconds boom an explosion from the side knocks a character off their feet the bad guys come from either above or below and mediocre coreography ensues if there isnt an explosion to start its not an action scene at least not to the poor saps who wrote this movie a superhero movie should deliver on entertaining action and i was laughing so props for thatall in all this is a film for kids looking to see the stars wars to hit the ocean floor its not average its fairly below average and even laughable at times but go watch it if your into cheesy stuff its a fun movie and you wont be bored at least not during the action sequences 410,fantasy
the most disappointing film of 2018 i was expecting big things and have heard big things i thought this would rescue the dceu how i was so wrongill start with the positivescgi was pretty good the underwater effects and sounds were clever the fight sequences were cool in wide anglesnegativeswooden actors galore a few decent perfermances but they did what they could was an appalling script story was predictable and the trailer gives it away after 5 minutes i questioned everything extremely childish and literal toilet humour that could have been pulled from a film aimed at 4 year oldsi was completely pulled out of the film early on and the sicily lovepinocchio scene it made no sense and was honestly cringeworthy beyond belief scenes became predictable with predictable shots scene endingsdo not waste your money and do not believe the hype,fantasy
first i would like to preface this review by stating that i am a big james wan fan his directing style and talent are unparalleled in the horror genre but even a director as talented as wan couldnt save this train wreck of a filmi could go on and on about everything wrong with this film but that would literally take up the complete running time of the movie so instead to save all readers and potential viewers the trouble i will include the aspects that were  okthe trench creatures awesome  best scene of the movie visually acted and directed dont worry no spoilers here because this scene is in the trailers this is the only scene where i felt james wans talent and horror flare showed through the creature design was incrediblebut aside from that one scene literally 5 min of the entire movie there was nothing that could save this disasterplease if you value your time or the time of others do not go see this film wait for the movie to go to redbox and rent it for 175 so you can skip forward to the trench scene honestly 175 is a steep price to pay considering the trash you are about to wade through but hey its your time spent i have already wasted mine,fantasy
the movie has great characters and amazing cgi effects the sea creatures appear to be real and for some seconds you can forget that they were made by computers but this isnt enoughtin all the movie we can see switches between past and present always breaking the action to show us something that we didnt have to know we can also see a lot of exposition in dialogues in most parts explaining laws of atlantis over and overand the biggest problem for me is that if the movie is too much calm certainly will have an explosion introducing the villains in arthurs father house in the submerged boat in the bottle scene in italy they dont know another way to get in a scene so the movie becomes to be a little predictive,fantasy
from begining to end the storyline was so great i sat there for 2 hours nearly falling off my sear,fantasy
visual effects were way over exaggerated making the plot boring,fantasy
plotholes yesbut funny entertaining and some of the best action and camera work i have seen recently,fantasy
dc fnally you have done something good must watch a visual master piece,fantasy
it seemed like they were trying to capture the tone of ragnarok and blend it with the adventure of avatar they missed the mark over acting poorly writtendelivered lines red hair that wasnt necessary and underwater storm trooper wanna be soldiersmamoa and company i think did the best with the lines they had the entire cast is way better than this performance the best actor in the whole thing was the main villanmeras hair was ridiculously bad tone it down look natural look like you have lived in a place the majority of your life that doesnt get sun the wig was bad and it made her look so out of placeatlantiscan you make it halfway believealble that we shouldnt have discovered it it looked bigger than rhode island and brighter than vegasthe soldiers armor was terrible it didnt fit at all with living under water or the armor that the leaders were wearing sea life is stealthy not bright whiteall that said the plot was good i hope they dont get a big head with this movies success and apply this formula to other dc movies,fantasy
so this movie was basically black panther underwaterand being filmed as a underwater moive they spared no expense in making you feel like the audio was recorded in a bathroom other than that if almost felt like i was watching a marvel moive in fact it felt like i was watching black panther,fantasy
thats the one word that kept circulating in my head as i was watching thispronice visuals some gags are funny momoa is pretty badasscontra the story is terrible you can literally guess all the of it from the begining that on its own makes the 25 hours feel way longer the music is terrible it breakes the atmosphere constantly and you find yourself wondering why would they choose that song instead of watching the film they are still trying to sell a superhero universe mostly made for kids as a dark and realistic space it gets more and more tryhard with every movie i mean if you want to look at it with a realistic eye just think for a bit about the last big battle sceene also we just needed a random love interest for a guy like this totally made sense as the bigest cliche of a cliche collectivewhat probably hurts the most is all the wasted potential they should finally learn to roll with the story instead of trying to make the most realistic epic fairitale of a hero ever,fantasy
the dceu has never produced a good film and sadly is no exception its an overlong slog that has a terrible narrative unbelievable cgi average performances and an awful expositionfilled screenplay the film just gets worse as it progresses and i had completely lost interest by around the halfway point there is one good action sequence near the middle of the movie that is actually rather entertaining and that is probably due to the fact that it uses real stuntpeople and fight choreography as opposed to the awkward cgi body doubles that are used in 75 of the action setpieces the problem with these is that since we dont care for any of the characters at all it is easy to notice that cg has taken over if we were invested in the narrative and were bothered by the films stakes then the cg replacement would probably be less of a problem talking about character some of our heros decisions are completely unbelievable and make him a totally unlikeable character the film does use some good scene transitions sometimes but thats hardly enough to save the picture the worst thing about it however is that its simply not fun it could have at least been entertaining and i could have even excused the bad narrative and dialogue if i was having some kind of fun yet i was bored throughout most of it and was never invested within the story its the worst superhero film of the year and one of the years worst films full stop 410,fantasy
my rating  810james wan gives us some breathtaking visuals with the underwater world of atlantisthe movie has solid action plot and overall cinematography is really eyecatching and at 2 hours 22 mins it doesnt feel too long either which is nicethumbs up,fantasy
great story momoa does a great job reprising his role has a great ending that leaves it open for a sequel,fantasy
i enjoy the dc and marvel movies but this was so overdone it could have been put into a 90 minute film and that would have been much better the special effects were brilliant in fairness but how much action does one film need to have my 12 year old daughter absolutely loved it,fantasy
what a masterpiece visually stunning and the action sequences are amazing jason mamoa and amber heard great chemistry story is amazing and full of heart plus the rupert gregson williams score is just perfect and last but not least james wan is a geniusi will highly recommend to watch it on the biggest screen available,fantasy
 briefly seen in batman v superman2016 and team player in justice league2017 now gets his own movie and jason momoa comes alive has the main hero known named arthur curry better known has and amber heard also shines has mera who had a small role in justice league but really shines more here she is awesome has tough badass merathe effects are great scenes in the water are well done fight scenes are also good supporting cast dont disappoint either im wanting to see more of this story has it goes on,fantasy
critics demonstrate how out of touch they are with the audience of this film critics should not bother to try and bring down this film cause fans of the series or the comics will go anyways and draw their own conclusion this is the most visibly beautiful and heart warming of the dc films in spite the leftist nwo un infused propaganda i thoroughly enjoyed this film gorgeous cast and scenes the only criticism i have making this a 910 is that the lead actor cant act however his stature and appearance make the fight scenes and his inheritance believable definitely had a similar setting as black panther  with its hidden world of advanced technology a brothers quarrel and a feminist heroine and with arthurs demi god status just like thor this film still manages to distinguish itself from the others the battle scenes are accentuated by their magnificent color rather than a murkey dark blur the fantastical world under the water and the legends of the seas themselves make for an escape that was well worth the time,fantasy
a superhero origin story adrift in a sea of cgi minor villains that you just cant enjoyrespectadmire let alone root for and dismal acting from most of the entourage cast when youre gasping for water even a toilet bowl is sweet relief marvels reign at the top looks pretty safe,fantasy
watched 3d version in amc theater it was not even as good in fact its one those hyped and low quality interns story visual and even screenplaywould not waste my money on this,fantasy
while im sure dc fans will love this movie and give it 10s and im not comparing mcu to dc here everyone else will find a completely unoriginal poory written poorly acted poorly directed overly cgd bdafbig dumb action flick i had low expectations and this movie slid right under them with room to spare characters are 2 dimensional at best and hit their hero poses ready for their slowmo closeup to deliver their tacky one liners every time fight scenes have the camera swinging around it like they are on a carousel no one gets more than a booboo or an ouchie and get ready for the good old you think theyre dead no wait theyre still alive they could have done something great here the potential was there the cast the basic story reluctant would be king the budget what they got is a forgettable movie that will make them lots of money,fantasy
the movie is full of superhero poses and one line dialogues that normal people do not use even though they live under water i know an origin movie is kinda hard to make they should have concentrated more on building the character and have more backstories make the viewers care for the characters in the movie thats the whole point of an origin movie the visuals were good though,fantasy
first of all the animation is amazing but the plot is garbage and the acting is at sometimes very bad,fantasy
the aesthetics are absolutely fantastic in this film and the set pieces were purely stunning but if you want a fast paced edge of your seat thrill ride dont be suppressed if you find yourself waiting a tad too long,fantasy
film review no spoilersindiana jones style adventure mixed with black panther style of tussle between two contenders for the throne i was expecting the story to take a different route but it didnt also its fast paced and that can be a bit jarring because at times the way it abruptly cuts to a scene that explores another subplotit feel like its just another superhero film with just another okay pair of villains but its an entertaining onewhy was i entertained and engaged regardless of cliches i cared about the characters of and mera i was rooting for them and was invested in their adventures they learned from each other and what they went through this is how a character arc works and while it is a pretty simple form of character arc it worksthere are some really awe inspiring visuals in underwater scenes especially near the third act the use of bright and vivid colors in some of those underwater moments is so good that the same cheesy moments in some of the old comics prenew 52 that you wouldve thought will never work in live action somehow look great action scenes are fantastic as wellwhile it is beautiful at times at other times it looks very very cheesy and artificial this is one of the negatives that im going to discuss in detail maybe its a personal preference but at times the comic bookesque costumes dont mesh well with the world theyre inhabiting this is one of the reasons i dont like visual aesthetic of some of the mcu films their worlds look too plain and the costumes end up looking sillyand talking about silly i have to say that shouldve taken itself a bit more seriously than it did jason momoa is constantly trying to make you laugh villains are making cheesy entries in slow motion like bollywood films it feels dceu is giving in to mcus approach in order to please the critics im not saying mcu films are bad but dc needs its own signature style but does not feel like it belongs in the same universe as mos bvs or wwi preferred zack snyders dark and gritty style snyder knew how to balance realism with comic book visuals zack snyder also brought that sense of gods among humans to these heroes in his films you felt the weight of their powers how the world reacted to them also added to that but in it seems like they have kind of nerfed these powers and brought him down to earth in order to make him more human yes does a better job at making you care for its hero than man of steel did but it doesnt quite treat its hero like the godlike being hes supposed to be i preferred the latter approach with good writing of courseback to the pros surprisingly amber heard is pretty good in this i was skeptical about her but she was very charismatic and charming in the role jason momoa did a decent job of carrying the film as well considering he has never really led such a big blockbuster all by himself nicole kidman put on probably one of the best performances in the film patrick wilson was just okaymy verdict is that is a flawed but decent ride for film goers i will not say that its a step in the right direction for dc because i want them to at least tone down the humor just a little bit especially with characters that are not entirely comedy basedeven with the flaws it pleased me with heroes that i could root for certain moments of sheer badassery and nicely tied up character arcs i hope they improve upon the flaws in the sequeli give it a 6810,fantasy
when you hear comic book movie you probably think of disneymarvel dm because of all of the dm movies out there lets face it though dm have definitely developed a formula to making their movies which isnt good because movie formulas make movies samey it is a successful formula to be sure dm have made what 20 movies but this kind of formulaic approach will kill the comic book movie perhaps part of the success of 2018s venom is how it broke from the mould by being its own weird and wonderful entity goes further still does not just break this mould it shatters it is an excellent film one of the best fantasy films ive seen and highly worth your time it is not formulaic it is not a filler movie until the next crossover it actually helps reinvigorate the term comic book movie and succeeds on nearly every levelthe plot is classic fantasy there is a rightful heir to the throne an evil dictator a princess and magic all set through the lens of the sea instead of swords and sorcery you have tridents and atlantean technology it is familiar but different thanks to the underwater aesthetic and how the movie treats its lore it is not constantly patronizing us with stupid jokes or nods that break immersion like marvel and deadpool movies nor does it take itself too seriously like the dark knight movies perhaps that should be the distinction between dc and marvel dc adheres to its lore more closely and in doing so benefits from greater immersionthe leads and mera have chemistry together but neither are fantastic actors but they are earnest and look their parts and there is so much wonderful content to this movie that when they fumble a line or a moment it is of little consequence the movie is also quite long but that is a nitpick you cant hurry epic fantasyit is fitting that the characters call king arthur at the end of the movie is in the same class of excalibur lord of the rings conan and highlander,fantasy
it was so good it was so good it was so good wowwow wow wow wow,fantasy
wow best movie ever rocks thanks for making this,fantasy
 rises from the depths and brings back faith in the dceu after the underwhelming justice league movie the task of keeping the light on in the darkness of the dceu falls on the most underestimated member of the roster in the biggest surprise of the last couple of years the new dc is movie is not only good but probably the best of the new universe all in all i for one left the theatre in good spirits a feeling that persists even a day later as im writing this revieweven the synopsis is more coherent than most of the other dceu movies when it comes to the story is inspired by geoff johnss new 52 storyarc that relaunched the character in critical and public acclaim while they are not profound or thought provoking the story and the script are simple easy to follow and very engaging it is inspired by the arthurian quest while also being a swashbucklingadventure movie the way the story goes always makes you excited for the next step in the heros journey because finally manages to follow the classical mythic structure im not saying moviemakers shouldnt take risks bending or modifying this structure but most of the time we get convoluted and confusing stories like batman v superman the third act of the movie and the fact that it embraces every element be it silly or not makes it better than wonder woman for methe cast is pretty solid and the characters receive a pretty balanced screen time jason momoas performance in jl was decent but felt out of place here momoa shines he unleashes all of his charisma and has fun playing a fun character in lighthearted and a little arrogant coming to terms with his heritage and history he isnt very changed after the events of jl but he does understand the consequences of his actions he grows on his arthurian journey and becomes a more responsible person his relationships with those around him are also very important mera amber heard is his guide on the journey and the chemistry between momoa and heard plays a big part i was very impressed with ambers acting vulko willem dafoe is his mentor the one that showed him the atlantean way and i was sad that his role was not as big as i hoped but dafoe makes the best out of his appearances nicole kidman as atlanna arthurs mother also does a very good job temuera morrisons role as tom curry is small but brings an important emotional elementthe movie has two villains king orm arthur halfbrother as the main one and black manta as a secondary one patrick wilson as king orm does a terrific job his character is constructed as a roman emperor stern noble and arrogant orm has a purpose and his motives are always clear so no mumbojumbo villain here he sees himself as the true leader of the atlantean empire and acts like it his experience working with james wan on both franchises but also in horrors gives him an edge in playing a menacing but powerful character black manta yahya abdulmateen ii is main antagonist in the comics but the story nedeed to focus on arthurs rise and his battle with orm so manta is merely introduced here his origin story is very well done as we find out about him and his hatred for the hero and seeing just enough of him to understand his story he is clearly set up as a bigger villain the future storiesvisually is breathtaking the underwater world looks amazing blending elements of scifi and fantasy shows us an imaginary world that is the stuff of dreams yes the movie is bonkers you have sharks with laser guns on their backs armored seahorses warrior crabs and an octopus playing the drums but its the kind of stuff we used to imagine as kids the kind of creations that made us daydream forever and it is amazing it might seem silly but doesnt shy away from going full on comicbook style and for that it deserves a golden starfish the soundtrack is also very well crafted composed by rupert gregsonwilliams the music fills every scene with that sense of wonder and heroism making the whole journey an adventure for the viewer as welloverall is a solid superhero movie it knows what it wants to make us feel and never strays from the path it chose when i left the cinema i felt good i felt entertained and pleasantly surprised as i was cautious it being a dc movie made me feel that spirit of adventure awe and wonder that i havent felt since i was a kid and stayed up late to watch the wizard of oz or the clash of titans on tcm and that makes it one of the best comicbook movies because in the end as much as we want drama and profound lessons we need superheroes and their stories to make us feel better to take our minds away from our daily lives and our problems and transport us into a fantastical world brimming with adventures heroes monsters and the hope of a better world,fantasy
i like dc but dont mind pointing out their flaws for some reason i watched this movie looking for mistakes and i did find scenes which couldve been improved but overall it was a lovely film one must watch in imaxi heard people complaining about thesevfx it was amazing just a scene on land which had an improper explosion but everything else was mind blowingplot great screw comparisons with other movies because none of that comes into mind hereless black manta movie isnt about him being the antagonist the main villain hes set up for the futureno logic falsenot mcu really so whatreally liked this movie i want to watch it again went with 2 die hard mcu fans who was num at the end of the movie xd,fantasy
theres a lot working against the first solo movie the dc cinematic universe has a poor track record underwater cgi can be extremely difficult to get right and the concept of as a hero is ridiculous even by comicbook standards yet somehow director james wan has dished up one of 2018s most entertaining blockbusters well and truly matching its marvel counterparts on the funscale it may be silly but its the perfect type of silly after helping the justice league defend earth against steppenwolf arthur curry jason mamoa finds himself at the centre of another looming invasion on his home planet  this time from the deep sea atlantians led by his halfbrother orm patrick wilson with action sequences both on land and under water wan doesnt miss his opportunity to thrill with inventive and exhilarating set pieces starting with a precredits fight that sees nicole kidmans atlantian queen kick some serious butt in one long unbroken shot the film engages in a game of oneupmanship with itself the action getting bigger wilder and more ambitious not every single sequence tops the last but theres a healthy upwards trend leading to the climactic oceanic battle like all big budget flicks the computer effects are abundant and lavish but particular credit goes to the vfx team for making the underwater sequences look amazing and to a certain extent feel realistic its not just the impressive visuals and exciting action that makes this movie a blast though the tongueincheek tone and carefree humour signals loud and clear that this movie is in on the joke and that dc characters can have fun whilst also being a bit moody it also helps that mamoa is just so damn likable too his reluctant superhero is the kind of guy you would want to share a few beers with where mamoa ends and arthur curry begins is a blur his reallife laidback persona forming a large part of the role not everything works yahya abdulmateens pirate subvillain is a misfire the second act sags a little yet the film is firing on so many cylinders that these are mere blips quickly forgiven throw in an epic thor ragnarokesque soundtrack and is popcorn cinema done right,fantasy
 you must see this year you will love it i know that i did  i thought it was the best movie that came into theatres from the dc comics so you really should go and see it,fantasy
james magic wan has put together one of the greatest superhero movies of all time jason mamoa is dcs new powerhousecant wait for part two,fantasy
great cast  awesome affects had me on the edge of my seat when is part 2 coming out ,fantasy
the story is great the actors are good the sets scenarios all comes to together to make this one of the best worth to watch movies of 2018,fantasy
 delivered and big  i really enjoyed this movie and the ending was fantastic,fantasy
this movie contained aspects of the throne of atlantis story which i was hoping for every one of the scenes also had very beautiful cinematography and was down right amazing definitely the best and my favorite dceu movie,fantasy
the beginning is boring the movie picks up graphics are great,fantasy
over use of cgi and oversaturaton of colours in some parts are the only cons,fantasy
 sets a new benchmark and standard for superhero films on an aesthetic level the art direction in this film was absolutely mind blowing the costumes sets locales cgi was unlike anything seen outside of game of thrones this film was not only immensely epic in scope but it works on a dramatic level which was something i often wondered about before arriving at the theater it did not disappointthis is why i read pulp fiction and love superhero films this is not deadpool its deeply spiritual and emotional and most importantly relatable lots of social commentary in this film regarding real world issues having to do with the destruction of the environment and pollution of the planet and even arthur as super as he is is very relatable in this film written as a rather reclusive depressed underachiever archetype that all people will relate too the dc motto was regarding their heroes was always that its not about dna or blood but what people do that makes them heroes and nothing more is the poster boy for the alien hybrid or fallen angel whose earth blood balances out his alien blood making him more suitable for the throne than full blooded atlanteans who are can be too ruthless at timesthis is supposedly an origin film but i had wished for more flashbacks perhaps another ten minutes of young arthur could have fleshed out his relationship with vulko who i absolutely loved william dafoe played an excellent even headed mentor to young arthur curry fans of will be very happy and fans of stories like king arthur will absolutely adore the neo myth of the universejames wan i am officially a fan i am not sure how this could be the same director as those horror films if you love long take action scenes beautiful wide angles and action choreography then brace yourselves so many films today feature chaotic action with no sense of wow factor this film felt like a roller coaster ride that i wanted to jump back into immediately after it endedi cant end this review without talking about the art direction againit is oscar worthy this film was like one big romanesque painting the makeup costumes the design of the atlantean ships and technology all looked absolutely gorgeous and this film is clearly a product of passionate filmmaking of course all of this is nothing without a good emotional story with characters you care about and it truly was a touching story some of the comedic stuff felt out of place but never ruined tension it got better and better as it went on and the 3rd act was very tense was always my 2nd favorite superhero film and is no longer underrated thanks to james wan who did it,fantasy
predictable but still a great choice for having a great time at the movies nice to see the main character origins and great to see black mantha in live action how this villains motivations remind me bobba fett and the relatives antagonism remind me either thor and black panther but hey its thor one of my favorite dc comics and childhood heroessoundtrack also includes shes a mystery to me by roy orbison written by bono and the edge,fantasy
well youre in luck is friggen fantastic in what it sets out to do you have comedy some jokes a bit typical drama tear shed moments epic action scenes fantastic fight choreography and camera workim actually stunned i know dc movies of late get a lot of flak but i left that theater feeling like hit all their check marks and even moresoto that i say bravo congrats on dc because this movie is definitely a win for them i had fun,fantasy
visuals are great and soundtrack is solid but story is meh cgi is cool and not as bad as in justice league mamoa is great and patrick wilson is amazing but he got little screen time overall its pretty average superhero movie but entertaining so if you wanna have some fun time go and see itps they put pitbulls remix of toto are they crazy,fantasy
what do you get if you mash up every superhero cliche together and make it look good the only depth the film had was that it had scenes deep in the ocean every character is very superficial and you can tell this was not due to bad actors but due to the whole script itself it lacked any kind of originality which is great for anyone just looking to watch a classic superhero film its lack of depth is actually pretty surprising when you remember that it has a run time of 2 and half hours that would be plenty to write a complex storybut if it didnt have any depth then what did it have visuals lots of action jason momoa and amber heard its like the same genre as transformers really you just basically go to watch a huge pile of cash all focus is on being entertained by something happening and looking good and this it actually does pretty well not once was i bored when watching the film and especially the scenes when they are sailing the ocean looks really good and amber heards hair is super red and shinyso if you want to see this then at least you are gonna know exactly what youre gonna get and amber heard is really hot,fantasy
great action flick with amazing visuals and a ok plot definitely a step in the right direction for dc as momoa killed it knew exactly what kind of movie it wanted to be and didnt try to later in too much comedy undertones or edginess 100 worth to see it in the theatres as the fight scenes and cinematics really stand out go see it and be happy you did,fantasy
soundvisual effects are perfect but the movie plot and script are oldfashioned and dont have any inner meaning,fantasy
why the hell did the little mermaid ever want legs such a beautiful man,fantasy
loved it what a true hero not too scary feel good movie definitely a must watch,fantasy
possibly the best origin superhero movie ever made,fantasy
i would quote  this is badass though i have seen its hindi dubbed version for indian audience and thats where i feel a big mistake the charm of the film is jason momoa and he has this gigantic personality and manly voice but the voice in dubbed version is really no match for this superhero guy i mean take a look at marvel franchise its not hit due to its graphics and cool action sequences but the dubbed version had that impact over the mind of audience i strongly suggest to redub the voice of arthur and everything else is just fine scenes and sound is great it has potential to uplift a new franchise no more darkness and dc likes colors as well ,fantasy
ok im not well verse in the dcu so this first story of would be very intriguing for mehowever that was not the caseif i were to write this story i would write it such that it brings out the part why arthur deserves to be the king i would imagine he stole the golden trident with the trident rejecting him by burning his hands i would imagine the evil brother declaring war with earth people both ready to destroy each other and then stood between the two worlds to stop the war he sacrificed his own life to shield atlantis from the attacks of earths leaders his trident would then be the magical weapon it deserves and stop the rising gigantic tidal waves in suspension leaving the homosapiens in awe hence learning a very important lesson dont screw with mother nature no more pollution the atlantis people would recognize him as their true king the earth people developed trust with this halfbreed and the trident accepted him as its rightful ownernopenone of thathowever the cgis are great the fighting scenes are quite intense and all the characters used for this movie are beautifuldcus got a chance to shine in this holiday season since mcu is hanging in suspensionwell most of its characters are half dead,fantasy
i was apprehensive at first when i purchased tickets a month ago from the amazon prime early screening promotion if youre asking why you havent seen the other films or you maybe asking why the hell would i bother with the dc films at this pointallow me to elaborate man of steel 2013 set the precident for what would become the dc extended universe i liked it for what it was perhaps not as much as i enjoyed the superman 1978 epicbut its no mention that it surpassed the films proceeding itthen the highly anticipated batman v superman dawn of justice 2016 hit the cinemas i was part of that geeked crowduntil that somewhat jarring moment when jimmy olson was killed and that was only the tip of iceberg of what ensued the next two hours i hated batman v supermanfor doing something things right specifically with batman but having such a chaotic storyline that had a layer of subplots in order to expand the story only to weight it down but thats just a front because i was fuming that superman was killedin his second filmwe are not going to talk about sucide squad 2016 beyond the fact that margot robbie was the best thing in itthen wonder woman 2017 camereassuring me that there was hope for the franchise and finally gave us a superhero movie that fit the sensibilities of its source material so when justice league 2017 was nearing i thought there could be some hope justice league was just as well a mixed bag but not exactly the same mixture as batman v superman it seemed that its tone was everywhereand i can go on all day about it 2018 however is in fact a good film its performances were strong especially yahya abdulsmateen iis black manta and patrick wilsons ocean master momoa makes his own and even sort of gives a jack burton vibe to his performance amber heard is also pretty good but the chemistry between the two seemed at moments forced albeit brief i have always been a fan of the comics growing up granted as good of a film this was it had flawsparticularly with its choice in songs for certain scenes the cinematic score was solid but the soundtrack for this film derailed the films momentum at some points and truth be told if youre going to use a cover of a toto song just use toto the film also suffers from too much exposition in its storybut it suffers like a a twoday cold well more like a ten minute cold in case but the film gets things right with everything else what was the most entrancing was the extravagant cinematography yes there is some heavy handed cgi that is utilizedbut it doesnt hurt the film and the scope of atlantis and its lore are well established james wan once again makes a good film and its refreshing to see a dc hero that we as an audience never seen before attempted on the screen nor television for that matter come to life and handled wellbut give this film a chance because it is in fact good hopefully this well set the scene for the dceu in the near future but ive been fooled before,fantasy
great visualsgreat cgigreat directinggreat plot,fantasy
best dc since batman trilogy visuals are astonishing its impressive in that regard think of the animation used in doomsday but applied the entire movie audio wasnt that much but still ok not the most original plot but perfectly well executed and told,fantasy
visually striking movie one of the best hero movies to come out this year,fantasy
there are moments of boring movies is the best storyteller the eyes of the audience daredevil you are very much,fantasy
i really stunning in the movie graphic  nice screen play waiting for 2 part,fantasy
this is best dc movie in recent yearsof course not better than legendary batman movies but still better than every mcu movie,fantasy
this movie does what few dceu movies have done the story is original and enthralling the graphics draw you in and leave you gasping for breath as you forget that you are not the ones under the sea but it was the action that reined supreme the fight scenes are some of the stars of this movie the characters use everything in the scene to dominate their opponent you forget that you are watching a movie and that is the mark of a fantastic movie,fantasy
great cinematography james wan imagination of atlantis is simply stunning the characters potrayal are accurate as if coming straight from comics and dc animated series this is by far the best superhero movie ever,fantasy
first of all the movie is epic with great storyline and mindblowing vfx some pros are action graphics attitudeand cons sorry cant find them,fantasy
cool superheroes movie awesome how james wan can direct movie with cool atmosphere and mixed theme little bit drama adventure comedy and horrorone word good job wan,fantasy
i am overwhelmed and so amazed by this film i am a fan of both dc and mcu characters the last time that i am trilled watching the action and awesome storyline was during the superman but after i was waiting for something like that again and finally you gave us every part of the film visualsaction and cinematography made me to glue to screen so amazing,fantasy
i must admit i did have a lack of confidence before forcing my marvel fanboy friends to this movieim a hard core dc fanbut man its really good i mean there even parts where we all laughed because of comedythe fights and action scenes were awesome  special effects stunning there were some parts which for sure youll end up saying this is definitely by james wan for his horror oriented directiona new era for dv movies has begun,fantasy
to those who say that wonder woman is the best dc movie  they are proven wrong by none other than this awesome movie the vfx the actions and background music are the movies backbone the movie finally shows us there is still might be some hope for dc universe,fantasy
yes i admit as i dc fan boy my expectations from dceu was high but they somehow struggled like new born child learning to walk but after the child had learned to run and i think its rebirth of dc i can watch this movie twice and even any unfamiliar comic person would enjoy itany family can watch it phenomenal adventure and impressive graphics story stands strong every character has its role and action is the best of 2018 after infinity no doubt in that i happy and i am satisfied your money you spend on this movie will be worthwhile  go for it without hesitationfor me 1man of steel 2 3wonderwoman 4justice league 5bvs,fantasy
its cheesy overlong and prioritizes being cool above all else often to the scripts detriment but its also the biggest  most ambitious comicbook movie ive ever seen is inherently flawed but it makes ragnarok look bland  infinity war look cute by comparison,fantasy
story is old and predictable hero of the movie is director,fantasy
for those who used to say dceu was a sinking ship james wan presenta you to the mesmerising land of atlantishe has made a fantastic movie with homogeneous contents of a super hero movie the fun  adventure vfx dcs significance through perfect balanced darkness love wonderful chemistry of jason and amber stunning fightsand wonderful scenery both in land and watera huge appreciation for the vfx teamsall hail james wan,fantasy
pure action from start to finish jason momoa really lives up to the character great special effects humor in the right measure as in marvel movies along with wonderwoman its the second dc movie worth just watching and watching again think thorragnarok of the seas mixed with doctor strangeworth every penny spentcongratulations to the director of the film and cast i hope this director is called to the next justice league movie,fantasy
lots of action big fight scenes some plot holes and questionable music cues overall good acting specially by patrick wilson  jason mamoa but amber heards acting brings this movie down a bit i get that she was cast for her looks but maybe she shouldnt be given many lines or acting scenes other than that really enjoyed the movie my advice turn off your brain and enjoy this movie for what it is big action in a visual marvel of an underwater world,fantasy
this film would have been great if it came out a few years backnow its those kind of superhero origin stories people are getting a little bit tired of the storytelling is old school and safe about how a special kid is grown to become a hero and the obstacles our younghero has encountered and conquered which eventually turned him into a real hero and allthe plot is predictable and there are quite a few awkward moments that absolutely cant bear second thoughts but anyway its a popcorn movie what should we expect moreim not saying that this is a bad movie on the contrary it is quite decent a superhero film that ive watched so far this year the choreography is good the actors are great its only because all the high hopes that i had for it after seeing the critics some people compared it to the star wars but to be honest i dont find any resemblances,fantasy
that line from to his defeated halfbrother as he lead away summed up nicely my need for counselling after seeing this utterly forgettable drivelfrom reliance to on deep meaningful stares to replace acting to a back story time line that contradicts itself whenever the paper this plot requires is once more proof that apart from wonder woman the dc universe films arent great  they arent even goodcharacter seems as equally confused as the cgi action at points after condemning manta rays father to death at the opening of the film for killing innocents at the end regrets not saving him and having made an enemythe film at point feels like it cant decide if it wants to be a super hero movie an indiana jones type artifact hunt a homage to jason and the argonauts or movie with a environmental message instead it tries to be all and misses the mark on each onethe villain is one dimensional until he cries when reunited with his long lost mother  while the story is utterly predictable with no surprises or twists to keep the audience guessing or engaged after half a hour id lost all engagement with the film and for the first time this year i found myself wishing that the movie would soon be endingwhilst not as painful as a tooth extraction such a visit to the dentist could arguably be more entertaining that this damp squib,fantasy
two brothers fight over a throne that will allow the winner to guide the destiny of multiple kingdomsworlds etc the younger brother is an usurper who lies and murders his way to the crown while the older brother is reluctant to accept the responsibility of the officesound familiar is very familiar from the sky bridge needed to enter atlantis to the quest to be worthy of a signature weapon weve seen this all of this before only done much betterand with loki no loki here only lots of cgi fishi dont mean to pick on the character i didnt expect much from the wonder woman film and i came away very impressed and i was willing to give this outing a chance but god from the corny dialogue to the idiotic aquatic theme  sharks with lasers strapped to them  is hard to watch after marvel has raised the bar so high over the last 15 years starts taking on water early on with far too many gosh darn earnest speeches about uniting two worlds a remarkably clumsy origin story designed to explain how atlantis went from being you know up there to down below and worst of all a main villain so bland the writers added a second supporting villain who pops up every now and again for the odd inconclusive battlefinally all of this 1970s saturday morning cartoon level idiocy drags on for a good two plus hours so be sure to set your wake up call for the 68th minute because thats how long youll have to wait for the first bit of action that doesnt involve talking to fishpixar elevated animated films from kids only dribble to mainstream entertainment because they created interesting characters and thoughtful stories richard donner tim burton and later marvel would do the same with the superhero films basically they made them better then they had to be is a huge step backwards uninspired and dumb i was reminded more of the 1980 flash gordon film then anything from recent years another bit of evidence that dc is throwing stuff at the wall hoping something will stick,fantasy
so yeh visually i thought the movie wasnt that bad the problem for me was the plot and scriptin terms of plot the movie was dumb lets put this into a stripped down summaryat some point in history when people thought the world was flat atlantis was an all powerful mecca that had advanced technology however they overreached and ended up blowing the place up and sinking it below the sea  ok sure i guess how did a bunch of people get so much more advance than the rest of the world exactly but anywaythen the king went into exile because he was all upset about what hed done  ok fine seems like a pretty poor rulerbut wait hes a good guy really because he wanted the one true king or something to one day come and get his trident to unite the surface and land people wait there wasnt any issues with the land people before why was the king bothered about that why didnt he just fix it himselfi digress so the king sets up this stupid elaborate treasure hunt first he puts a message in a bottle why a bottle  do sea people drink out of bottles and hid it in a place under the sahara desert  apparently when you fall under the sand in the sahara desert you end up in a deep cavern that has sunlight oh and did i mention that this place is some kind of forge where the trident was made  and its been there since the sahara was actually under water wait that was around 7 million years ago really so yeh then they have to find the message in a bottle in this ancient forge place that can only be accessed with a drop of water dumb and this bottle needs to be placed in the hands of a statue of a roman king to show where the trench isthen the king wanted the treasure hunter to sail to the trench which can i just point out is an area in the sea filled with big ugly monsters how has nobody sailed through this place before and been attacked  how does the world not know about this place that has millions of monsters in it go through it to the center of the earth which is apparently some kind of portal into another dimension why call it the center of the earth i dont know it has sunlight and get past an enormous monsterall of this gets you a shiny golden trident did the king not take his medication or something whats his deal surely anyone that found that place was going in to certain death if they werenti was just sat there laughing at this dumb elaborate treasure hunt the whole time my wife on the other hand was laughing at the jokes at them not with themon top of stupid plot line there were numerous gaffswhen fighting the dude with the big bug head got blasted pretty badly he came out without a mark on him fine but his clothes shouldnt havespeaking of clothes there were a few iffy random wardrobe changes there when there really shouldnt have been and there werent wardrobe changes when there should have been like when they got to the sahara and flew across it in their outfits which they then apparently continued to wear all the way to sicilyspeaking of random travel they went from a whales mouth in the middle of the ocean to the coast of africa  got some clothes and apparently chartered a plane across the desert they try to con us that they had a bag full of sea gold but no no they didnt have that they literally just escaped from the ring of fire battle and swam into a whale there were no bags of gold involvedthen how did they get to sicily they had fallen deep underground in the middle of the desert did they walk to europe seriously dci understand it must have been difficult with all the waterland changes but there were plenty of times hair was swaying around when they were in air pocketsthe fish boy whose father got killed why are you helping the man that killed him literally when shows up at the end and is clearly there to kick his stop his brother why is that little boy helping the bad guy he killed your father for no reason right in front of you stop helping himi could go on but come on dc you think you can just make a movie with action and cgi and expect to rival marvel marvel make compelling plots and have people on set that actually check that their movies make a shred of sense for a movie that cost around 160 mil to make you would think someone on the set would be like but theyre underground in africa how do they get to sicily also why is there sunlight in here,fantasy
i said before in my last review its trying to copy and all fans that were bribed by dc this film is rubbish im just being honest and i would love to see an honest fan review the critics are critics they know movies and they know what they are talking about it did have negative reviews as well so the fans be honest with your selfs its not a good film,fantasy
if the film could get wooping yuen to be the martial arts guidance the actions may be better than what they show now,fantasy
as a whole i enjoyed the movie but i have some constructive criticism1 i didnt feel a connection to the opening scene was great but after that he was quickly thrown into the position of trying to save the world before we got to know and find out more about him as a person eg what does he do on a daily basis some context would have built more connection understanding and likeability of the character the bar scene with his dad was great and personally i think more of that would have been beneficial2 normally in a movie you have a clear idea of beginning middle and end even if theyre following the comic book initially i had a clear understanding of what mission was but too many things came in the way and it was not reestablished what was doing i think this is a key principle for really great movies3 some of it was cringy and clich eg a perfect example is the kissing scene we all knew they would get together in the end and when they finally did it was just an awkward scene and there was no chemistry im not sure if this was due to the acting  script  directing4 lack of diversity  im not one to pipe up about diversity but there were only 2 black characters who happened to be evil and one of them had a questionable name i get that it relates to the comic book but because of the way it looks on camera i would have suggested more diversity in other aspects of the movie to mitigate this,fantasy
i am new out of the joint and am catching up on the movie in the pen i had my badass tats show everyone i am mutha not to be messed with and now i love he has tats and the ink shows he lives the thug lifehella movie,fantasy
bad script bad casting worse acting extremely cheesy doesnt match b vs s or justice league in quality,fantasy
long story short this is a film worth watching despite the horrible acting of amber heard who is this is she really an actress or just famous for being married to depp whatever the case she cannot act at all and even falls short in the looks department i dont understand hollywood sometimes momoa however was outstanding as was most of the cast,fantasy
i went in with no expectations having not read any reviews it started poorly mainly due to nicole kidmans botox and lip fillers and just got worse and worse this film boasts terrible cgi appalling acting a script you wouldnt wipe the floor with and a dead feeling inside that this got released at all i have really liked every other dc universe movie and i can only imagine the star power involved in this dogs dinner was as a result of how good wonder woman was james wan doesnt make decent horrors so why he thought he could make a fantasy ill never know i will be telling everybody i meet to avoid this movie my 3 score is due to the like ability of amber heard the casting of and the odd fight scene avoid,fantasy
i admit the movies is filled with adrenaline pact scenes it is really cool how the cinematography turns out in this movie credits to james wan you are guaranteed to be blessed by this moviehowever how the movie choose its background music is kinda weird it feels like i am in a concert plus it made some of the scene turned to be a bit cringygood thing is that they tried to put in comedy in the movie which is nice but a bit stale in my likingoverall dc movies as always give actions that we thirst for and as always put a movie in a fast pace that make us put an extra effort to not lost in it,fantasy
very disappointed i took my son and he asked to walk out half way through the film why some think its good im puzzelled you can see all but mine i wonder why not worth watching  honest,fantasy
awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome,fantasy
things the movie does well visuals things it doesnt everything else,fantasy
had to leave the theater after an hour and it was a lost hourim sure that for kids its a great movie but for me at 36 to watch something so predictable and boring the characters all lack depth the story is boring at least the popcorn was good,fantasy
i wasnt impressed with this film at all the story is one too familiar not original at all very good cgi but thats about it,fantasy
i literally hated everything about this movie superman is my favorite character of all time and i want these dc films to be good the writing was just terrible when a actorsactresses look like they just started making movies nicole kidmanwilliam defoe it points right back to the directingwriting it had some visually stunning moments but that is it its like the director said to himself  how many scenes can we put momoa in slow motion and an awkward pose after an action sequence i felt no connection between any of the characters beside one scene when momoa is talking to the guardian of the trident and you never even saw the face of the monster talking that was the only believable scene in the whole movie how this movie is getting such high praise is bs i thought to myself several times is this movie is it over yet and how much longer until the credits my wife who is general pretty easy of films and can enjoy movies for what they are had a hard time getting through this film,fantasy
best movie for me this year great wall meets avatar add to the mix jason  wow amazing action packed movie i can honestly say i didnt want this movie to end such amazing effects absolute must see,fantasy
being a dc fan expected the movie to be good though visual effects and underwater setting are good the plot is routine and predictable also the great music in trailer 2 is absent in the movie which is disappointing,fantasy
 movie non spoiler reviewwhy you should not worry that dc messed up againits directed by james wan if you liked the fast  furious 7 n cried yea its him who directed and has directed this one as well so you know its in good handswhy should you see itits easily the most beautiful super hero movie ever and is in same conversation with avatar2009 blue fantasytrust me on this one it is very very extremely beautifulsorry black panther but wakanda is no match for the sea the underwater scenes are those non ever seen on screen and a cinematic experience is a must for this one plot  storythe begging is a slow start and somehow hints that this would be another disappointing dc film as scenes are rushed for me narration is just a lazy style of story tellingnot a fan and it does turn me off but they added present day narration and flash backs which make it kind of unique and i would give it a pass for that the other thing is that the story is plan simple and straight to the origin story of establishing the plotaction  humoraction packed film with good fight scenes and well directed camera shoots  there is one you already saw in the trailer and it is well done after watching this film ranks just after superman and wonder womansorry batman but its true watching this film makes me hate justice league even more as is very powerful and should have been utilized in that film in terms of humor 11 out of 20 jokes are funny is all i will saywhere does it stand among dceu filmsmaybe some will disagree but there is batman the dark night and then yes i said it it second bestconclusionyou dont need to be a comic book or super hero fan to enjoy this movie dear parents you and your children will never forget watching such a film take them and yourself this coming weekend at fresh view cinemas i will repeat its the most beautiful super hero film ever,fantasy
i bought the ticket for in advance 7 days before it played in indonesia because of so high rating for this movie so many 89 and 10 but i really disappointedits so far than i expected i expected to watch a wonderful and unforgettable movie that can touch my heart and with great storyline and great action before my eyes and i did not get them allno chemistry between characters no plot twisted even the scene when mera is saved by one of trench and after that didnt surprise me i am sure you will understand what i meanwith the similar storyline black panther did it much better so if you still have a plan to watch this just watch but do not expect so much ignore the current rating or you will be disappointed,fantasy
im shocked to see so many 10 reviews on here i dont think i watched the same movie the pace was slow and i felt a little bored throughout the acting was okay but a bit awkward and clunky at times cgi felt dated infact the whole film felt from the 90s imo and the soundtrack was terriblepositives its a nice though predictable story and there are a few genuinely funny moments but for a film that had a lot of potential it falls flat disappointed,fantasy
spoiler alertthis movie blows,fantasy
so yesterday i got the chance to see and i truly did not know what to expect i had only seen the first trailer but went into the theatre since i really enjoy dcmarvelsuperheroe movies unfortunately this movie just wasnt it for methe main driving factor is the screenplay or mainly the way the plot was taken care of the beginning of the movie really threw me off since there was almost no exposition of the characters im aware and mera were technically introduced in justice league but that doesnt change the fact that i think a couple of minutes to further present the character interactions wouldve helpedthen theres the fact that i felt that some of the action sequences just threw too much into the situation the film is a great achievement of cgi and visual effects but sometimes less is best and im not talking about the atlantian effects because those were perfect and stunning i mostly refer to the last action sequence where the writers mostly knew the studio would give them millions of dollars so they decided to go all ini applaud james wan for presenting the underwater scenes in such an amazing way but the realworld scenes needed to showcase the same amount of quality as the underwater ones which left the movie feeling really unbalancedsomething that had never happened to me is being irritated by the scoresoundtrack i think the score did not know exactly what it wanted to do with the movie and there was no real consistency with the way it wanted to musicalize the film what was truly absurd was how in the middle of the movie after an intense and big action sequence they decided to throw in an upbeat pitbull song i started laughing out loud because i couldnt believe they decided to include thatthis movie just didnt work to me as a whole and i got tired in the middle of the movie because of how much was happening if youre a fan of superheroe movies and love those big budget all in action sequences then you probably will leave the theatre really satisfied,fantasy
wans hypnotic dive on his first comic book action isnt enchanting as it was anticipated to be this spectacular visual galore is too busy on fabricating the genre with the hip and happening slick nature that they sombre over the arena of basic requirements of storytelling this renegade and savior theory is not only outdated but the reasonings that fuels this drama is bourgeois dogmatic opinion to a people pleasing attitude the writing is chalky and barely reflects upon any practicality among either the conversations or the flow of the storyline it surely is visually stunning the details are rich and wisely cracked up for you to be in awe of the technologybut whats fascinatingly dull is the action that takes place up front it is questionable and at points bizarrely provocative if the choreography is lethally created and performed than the background where it is set in shucks away the leaps and kicks and empty punches amongst all these hokum what grabs your attention is the ferocious pace and smooth camera work of wan a fine example of it would be the sahara desert chase scene that in its own gullible reasons  how should i put it  is pure fun one of the major weakness of it is its antagonistif wilson is set to embark upon a journey of killing a series of lead characters then kanes obsession over satisfying his revenge is poorly executed but lets not rush our way in the core relationship of mamoa and heard itself is so chocolaty that none of the tone is palpable enough to pamper it up the forcibly imputed humor the usual bickerings and stealing a gooey romantic moment amidst a war everything pins down the narration below mediocritymomoa in the lead as a true heir is perpetually flat on expressing himself on screen he may have the persona of a god and boy can he fight with his bare chest and raw behemoth figure but as far as performance is concerned is not even skimming off the surface heard too is out of touch there is so much that her character has to do but it is so belittled by the concept that it is basically left to be a series of fumbles talents like dafoe kidman and wilson are not only underused and misused by over chewing the emotions till it grows numb it surely has its momentsthe sea creatures tiny tactics that varies on the surface and underwater and the procedure where the trident is retreated back by its heir especially the scene with the red flare such detours every now and then gives us hope to hold on to wan has a language and a theme that he has come up with and is persistently aspiring for big moments but to pull off such a large scale mythological tale is one thing and to stay true to it and match its wide range with narration is another wan lacks a better script is not the game changer that dc is looking for especially not when the rules are this benign,fantasy
i didnt enjoy i liked shape of water though and i dont like the probable implication that im not a kid anymorebut hang oni still adore the dark knight infinity war wasnt bad too so as an adult  i can still enjoy dcmarvel movies so what happened here the story telling wasnt intelligent enough for me to stay investedi mean  the characters and their development cant be so simple atleast give em some flaws thatll be properly exploited  the dark knight was painfully human half the mcu superheroes literally bit the dust just blinding visual effects combined with an all too predictable good beats evil plot wont do it for me anymoredid i mention shape of water  it holds a different level of emotion all throughout  shouldnt have brought it up here6 points considering the vfx ,fantasy
acting is horrible im sad to see the universe that zack snyder build be destroyed by the light direction that they decided to go,fantasy
okay i definitely could have done without the octopus playing the drums but isnt the dud that many claim it to be its certainly better than many of dcs dark and dreary superhero movies a visually impressive treat for the eyes and im not just talking about amber heard in her green skintight costume and ignoring a few contrived plot details a hugely entertaining rompdirector james wan has created a dc movie that for once looks and feels like a comicbook come to life with jawdropping production design and dazzling neon coloured imagery that is breathtakingly beautiful the story is clichd baddies versus goodies nonsense but i think thats the point this is intended to be brainless fun without all the emotional intensity and gloominess that made nolans batman films such a bore its got willem dafoe riding a shark for christs sake  its not meant to be taken seriouslyjason momoa plays arthur son of a lighthouse keeper temuera morrison and the queen of atlantis nicole kidman when he grows up arthur is convinced by stunning redhead atlantean mera heard to claim his rightful place as king of atlantis in order to prevent a battle between the sea folk and the land dwellers unfortunately his half brother orm patrick wilson is intent on warat almost two and a half hours long this could have easily run out of steam but wan keeps things moving at a lick introducing more and more bonkers action building to a climactic war between an army of talking crustaceans and the sharkriding atlanteans with momoa joining in the fun atop a massive monster from the depths oh and nicole kidman spends twenty years in jurassic park at the centre of the earth its all so gloriously daft and so stunningly rendered that i couldnt help but enjoy myselfthe film does overstep the mark occasionally with some the humour falling flat and i struggle to believe that a and mera would bring a seemingly insignificant bottle with them to sicily and b the statue designed to hold the bottle is conveniently still standing intact in the same place after thousands of years but these are minor niggles in a movie that hits more than it misses7510 rounded up to 8 for scorching redhead heard,fantasy
this is my favorite movie in the dc cinematic universei liked the movie wonder woman but i think this movie was betteri had already guessed that this film would be beautiful beacuse the director james wan and i was very curiousi guess it was the best visual effect of this year as i wrote in the titlei think the cast team was chosen very well and the acting was greati liked the battle scenes a lotit was a nicei would recommend to everyone,fantasy
i give this an 85 but a 9 works fine i guessafter the below average suicide squad and good but not great justice league i was very skeptical after hearing about this film its not only that but its also the fact that in the classic cartoons and comics was sort of a joke and not as positively received as everyone else in the justice league in justice league was great so i wasnt too worried but i didnt want this film to follow the same less than stellar path that almost every dc film from 2016 and beyond with the exception of the amazing wonder woman has thankfully i can say with confidence that this is one of the most pleasant surprises ive ever had in the movie theater this films trailers never really grabbed me thanks to the previously mentioned less than stellar films but this movie has so much more than i ever thought the performances especially from jason mamoa are all great the story not only goes on a great flow but it never takes itself too seriously which is definitely a good thing considering how silly and over the top this film can be which makes it more funny the overall presentation is phenomenal as the cgi is possibly the best ive ever seen in a dc film to date and the music score all fits perfectly this is one of the most entertaining films ive ever seen in recent memory and its a huge step up from the previously mentioned films it isnt perfect however as a few things did seem a bit off there were a few instances where a scene can have a very small plot hole it isnt anything that ruins the movie at all but it was still noticable to me the story itself while it is decently written and goes on a good flow for it to be enjoyable is a bit on the predictable side of things i love the setup and the structure of it but for every unpredictable moment there is theres always a predictable one its not bad by any means but it isnt as original as what some may hope besides that this film is definitely the best ive seen from dc in recent memory and while its no batman movie with christian bale or even wonder woman for that matter it still has more than enough to stand on its own and thats why i definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a fun goofy and stunning film as this has all of that in spades i do hope that there is a sequel as this is a fun movie that drowned my low expectations and i want some more action packed and watery goodness,fantasy
after the abysmal justice league movie i was more than reluctant to see this moviehowever i can explicitly say it is the best movie to come of dc universe since the legendary christopher nolans batman seriesthe first thing you notice about this movie is the sfx which was spot on especially the fantastic camera angles during fighting sceneswhile the storyline was particularly weak there were still scenes that delivered an emotional performance thanks to the dramatic music by the wayacting wasnt particularly great though but its forgivablenonetheless this was a movie i thoroughly enjoyed as it was fast paced had great visuals and signalled hope for the dcu,fantasy
this iz the best movie yeah this is too much fun,fantasy
if youre amazed by cgi pictures youll probably really enjoy this other than that its a load of garbage go do something productive with your 3hrs,fantasy
dc movies are so bad my buddies wanted to walk out of this movie last night but i had spent 12 on the ticket so no way i was leaving this was one of the cheesiest movies i have ever seen in my lifethe movie should have been pg i have no idea why it got the pg13 moniker must be because of all the obviously computer animated cartoon fight scenes from the movie all of the shark cartoons eating thingswhat a complete and utter waste of timegot 4 stars because the leading lady is amazingly beautiful,fantasy
 will forever be 1 of dc top notch character after this film used to be a laughing subject but now just look at what james wan did the  1 movie in the world now jason mamoa did a great job and the rest of the actors and actresses,fantasy
though the story are very marvel likeits all about a visual orgasmic cascade of vfx and cgieffects that bombards the optic nerve to a near apoplectic experience of motioncolor and sound its definately the very very best marveldc comic film i have seenand really challenges avatar when it comes to visuall impression i saw the film in 2d at the theaterand i donot regret that what i really regret is that i did not do an extra effort to find a 3d screeningdo that if you canthe acting though are average but the fights and acton shoots are spectacularand may the force be with youstar wars really looses terrain compared to what presentsif youre a nerd you may not like all the breeches of physical laws that are broken when living a submarine life and the moralistic standpoint taken on the polution of the ocean are daft and neverthelesslikei have given a 10 in a mood of hysteria of this film experience and even give a plus to the tenner for the ironical comments and comedy that are stuck inbetween i also sensed this from other spectators when leaving the theater so if you must choose between bumble bee and for your christmas giftcard cinema experience then go foryou will never forget itand you wont regret it anyhow im going to see this film many times at 05 and 025 speed just to swallow all the background and background movements it is pivotal an d majesticly done,fantasy
what a boring movie tries to be funny at times but doesnd succeed this was the first movie of dc when i thought how much longer,fantasy

judged upon the comic books and for this pop culture fanatic the ted knight narrated cartoon of the 1960s the original resembled this movies blondhaired warmongering villainhalfbrother to the new justice league established darkhaired hawaiianlooking jason momoa whose powerhungry utterly caucasian little brother wants complete control of atlantis to of course destroy the worldhaving been born down there the white boys not a half breed and its very similar to the sibling rivalry between marvels perfect thor verses the inferior frustrated runt loki but is more precise and straightforward than marvels more episodic movies also borrowing from  and taking the first name of  king arthurs sword in the stone legend and is arguably the best comic book outing since the first iron man and xmenalthough with all the cgi needed to make an underwater kingdom exist its funny that a movie mostly taking place in the ocean probably didnt get a single drop of water on the cast and crew but all the hidden green screen in the world cant stop this energetic from hitting the right marks since it takes the viewer from one location to another a bit like mission impossible ghost protocol and with each step theres a new literal clue to get to the next strategic levelall the while catching sporadic glimpses of without being tethered to or having to tell half the story with the origin involving aquaboy being trained by a wise mentor willem defoe that coincides while moving right alongside the presenttime obstaclesand the ocean isnt all we dive into from beneath the sahara desert all the way to the middle of the earth director james wan keeps the viewers gravity in check as the camera establishes where our reality begins and this movies fantastical regions begin remaining simple yet involving as momoas with his own pretty scarlet johanson type in amber heards mera go on whats basically a scavenger hunt to find king neptunes allpowerful tridentpitchfork that will allow arthur aka to you know do what he was born to dothe spy who loved me underwater lotus where they see the seathe second coolest action scene occurs when our initially reluctant hero learns the importance of the missions goal by failing without it  while the best fight plays out on an islands edge between and manta who will be the sequels lead villain more or less a henchman hereand in the fun and frolicking roger moore james bond flicks which is another likely inspiration especially the underwater vehicle that zips around down town in this unapologetic nonstop rollercoaster ride the worker bees make the best villains and tend not to drone on like the primary onesnot that its a perfect movie momoa and heards banter has a predictable he saidshe said cadence usually leading to she outwitting the physically superior he or he surprising she with having an actual brain along with the brawn and you might scream out just kiss already after a few forcedheated momentsmeanwhile atlantis resembles a bright shiny neon arcade cartoon albeit nicely scored with a fitting oldschool techno score and the puffybuff sharks look right out of shark talebut theres always a good enough reason for our heroes to be wherever the hell theyre at and unlike the last decade of marvel this is a tight actionadventure yarn for people sick of overlong overly complicated and painfully melodramatic comic book epics and yes there will be a sequel sequels actually but this proudly stands and swims by itself,fantasy
absolutely amazing best superhero movie in a long time,fantasy
 is light and fluffy it has some spectacular scenes with great special effectsunfortunately its over long and the acting in places is wooden its instantly forgettable ok for a light popcorn movie but lacks the depth of a good superhero movie,fantasy
i was not interested like others coz of continues bad movies from dceu but this one is really good  may be predictable story but definitely good one and very awesome visual that must be watched in theatrei didnt like cast in this film when i saw in trailer  but after few minutes of watching the movie then you definitely get attracted to the all characters and casting also so good unlike other dc moviesi really dont like end scene coz there is nothing new in that and it reduce the interest in prequal,fantasy
i dont have words to describe how colorful this movie is it is just amazing and the effects are superb watching nicole kidman is always a pleasure to me jason mamoa is fantastic in his role as on the other hand amber heard gives sexyness and a very solid performance it is just a wao movie and a must watch,fantasy
a piece of truly good cinema and one of the best dcmovies so far,fantasy
i expected something more something that surprised  it was not the caseeverything that proposes we already saw in other movies the plot the turns everything very predictable the dialogues the jokes  in short everything,fantasy
james wan has done an incredible job of creating the expansive underwater world of atlantis its highly imaginative and visually stunningjason momoa proves that he was the perfect choice for a cooler version of nicole kidman also has a great performance as queen atlanna and amber heards mera grows on you as the film progressesthere is only a tiny reference made to any dc film that has come before it and the film as a whole benefits from it this film is a true standalone and is right up there with wonder woman as a top tier dc film,fantasy
honestly the best movie ive seen from dc ever or atleast since dark knight rises came in 2008 wonder woman suicide squad bvs justice league were all pretty bad however was great the visuals were great story was good and stayed on course throughout the movie i had some doubts on underwater action scenes but they did really well jason momoa does a great job portraying in this my only letdown is kind of the ending personally it felt slightly rushed but then again the movie was already over 2 hours long i know people are very skeptical of watching the movie given its from dc and not marvel i had many friends saying this is why they wont watch the movie however i did and i didnt regret it,fantasy
thank you james wan now can you please redo the previous dc movies in the same style,fantasy
first of all im surprised that this movie had two villains and both of them beats whatever marvel has made in the villain section for at least 17 films great acting great story awesome soundtrack and the special effects are world class 810,fantasy
finally dc made something excellentexcellent cgiexcellent story line with flashbacks,fantasy
good storyline great perfomance of the and beautiful actresses cant wait for the next chapter,fantasy
tops everything from marvel studios except infinity war,fantasy
i watched it for visuals oviously and i didnt expect much action from it but seriously the action are pretty good as well the visuals and story well believe me it give me chills when i was watching it although good to see dc backing up,fantasy
this make me change how i see the cgi effect is good and beautiful in the future film,fantasy
just watched it yesterday and it was so amazing another great movie made by dc after wonder woman,fantasy
really surprised over seriously one of the best superhero movies jason makes a good,fantasy
the ph metric 605100 the ph metricin short fast and the furious logic and storytelling in water but i am sure that is what people are expecting so enjoylight spoilersdirecting 610the directing is decent there is a reason wan keeps getting big budget jobs but it is only a little bit more than average as it slams everything in your face wans directing style is more like a comedy that continually keeps firing jokes at you so that you will forget any of the ones that did not work and only focus on the fun stuffacting 310not sure if it was the actors or the script but for the most part it was very hammy as they say and i am sorry did they read the script and go wow we are recreating a cheesy 1980s action flick let us cast lundgren in it so that we can show how meta we are also the cheesy 80s style songs as wellcinematography 610i love cinematography it is probably my favourite aspect of a film but i cannot entirely agree with the shots in this film for example the shot when the two are on the boat with the sun over right shoulder i would not take a personal photo that has the sun burning out my retinas why would i think to put it in my film again the action is used to hide the framing and use of the shots but ultimately it is far from stellar especially in the undersea war near the endediting 810editing feels reasonably tight you can see a few times where it could have been tweaked a slight pet peeve of mine is when you know the camera just got rocked by a colossal setpiece run amok which breaks the illusion of the experience and reminds me that i am not immersedscoresound effects 810sound effects team excellent job no fault there score not so much it comes off as cheesy and a throwback to a time that mainstream blockbusters have long forgottenvisual effects 9510visual effects team did a great job and they deserve all the credit in this film not writing not directing not any other factor if people love this film in any way it is down to the visual effects great jobwriting 110wow did someone steal a script from a 1980s arnold film and say that is good enough because that is what it feels like everything is cliche everything right down to the kiss the two leads share during the war scene and she does the left leg liftproduction design 710was decent enough but the details were not there i suppose that can be forgiven given what the director was asking of youcostume design 710the people i went to the theatre with literally said ewww when they saw the costumes and they loved this film again not sure if these designs were forced on the department or not but they seemed to miss the markmakeuphairstyle 910i want to give them a ten for kidman they made her appear exceptionally young but there were little hiccups here or there and a little bit of age would have been appreciated on her character especially toward the end as the comparison when her and her partner hug at the end seemed quite odd,fantasy
i honestly thought dc movies are beyond cured after all their disasters movies james wan and his team truly bring them back to the surface i really think this is the only modern dc movie in par to the marvels well this and watchmen and nolans batman of courseall the scenes are beautifully made cgi are excellent story is pretty much predictable but they packed it in a fun way it is enjoyable to watchto dcs people please remake justice league batman vs superman and suicide squad with james wan as the director,fantasy
bang bang fizz whistle pop jingle jangleleave your brain at the door if you are watching comic book films in your adulthood you probably dont have one anyway,fantasy
yeah i saw this at an early screening and it was okaysome of the cgi looks a little goofy at times but it has a good story that we have seen a million times before and good action ironically enough because of the poor cgi the film will look better on a smaller screen i am happy i saw it for free but wish i waited,fantasy
flash reviewthis is a visual smorgasbord of fantastic underwater places people creatures and action what else would you expect the story overview is arthur curry who is born on land discovers he is half human and half atlanteean descent which actually makes him heir to the throne of the kingdom of atlantis neato bummer his mean halfbrother orm is currently ruling so you guessed it arthur must discover his true purpose and ability while securing the throne this was fun hollywood action fluff with a decent story and oodles of mammouthly majestic and spectacularly clich shots that came with such frequency it was a little bit corny and silly while mixing in intended dashes of humor the water effects and accurate water physics were very welldone and spectacular yet a bit too glossy looking whatever this is a popcorn movie so sit back and relax,fantasy
this has to be the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire lifetime horrible who the hell is doing this,fantasy
a trashy tattooed thug smack talking and taking his shirt off on the beach as he practices for a future he doesnt know existsi was waiting for him to pick up his surfboard any moment and go get laid with some equally trashy hep c victim,fantasy
the acting is passable and the effects are well done but there is zero plot thats terribly written,fantasy
the fighting scenes are so amazing and you really get to see the environment and so many more great cinematography in this movie that is hard to explain,fantasy
seriously dc this is what you give us boring plot a mountain of cheesy lines and some poor acting even the cgi was like it was from the 90s ill stick to mcu thanks they know how to make good movies,fantasy
terrible acting terrible plot nothing makes sense and i dont find the special effect moving or shaking boring computerized movie changes from hes got a nice life to being chased around by the all of a sudden bad guys whoever they are no warmth in amber or nicole kidmans personality the only thing that saves this movie is the stars buff pecks i feel sad for willem dafoe he is a good actor why this,fantasy
 has it all the worst dialogue every movie trope evar feeble acting and massive plot holesyeah yeah the visuals are amazing but the story requires a bigger suspension of disbelief than we should be asked to provide everyone wears bulky metal armor  underwater atlantis is near enough the surface to get sunlight and emits crazy tons of selfgenerated light  energy but human scientists havent found them and every bigtolittle thing the movie doesnt want to explain is chalked up to being caused by the atlanteans secret alsonotexplained proprietary energy source but seriously most of all its the lines you are the bridge between land and sea i can see that now gahi havent read the comic books but i trust those guys wrote a more plausible story rightstill jason momoa grunts leers smirks and fights his way through scenes to seem realistic as a superhero and he has some unpolished qualities that work in his favor even on the bad dialogue hes obviously been practicing since goti submit that his level of hotness and his hard work deserve better for the love of all that is good in the universe someone please write him a better moviemomoa hotness gets 15 stars from me i deduct 12 for how crap the movie is overallalso julie andrews can be the voice of the kraken because she was already mary poppins and fraulein maria djimon hounsou  willem dafoe should know better and roy orbison must be turning in his grave,fantasy
its funny seeing the characters played patrick wilson  others who are the nemesis of arthur played by jason momo i have been a fan of jason momoa ever since the 2nd season of stargate atlantis unlime wilson  the other actors jason has real muscles  tgey are not from lifting weights he is also a very bright individual who has oroduced  directed seceral shorts  a couple of feature length independent films aswell he doesnt beed a ouffed up muscle bound suit which is why you see him shirtless trust me he is more like actirs similar to gerard butler  chris hemsworth they all posess that rare combination of talent and beauty nit just oretty hunks with no brains who are a dime a dozen one coincidence is michael beach plays the father of black manta pirates who allows to drown whuch nanta seejs revenge for which in itself is actually quite stupid he  his father were murderers  pirates they chose the life regardless my point is jason momia  michael beach both were on stargate atlantis as allies momoa was cast in over 75 epusodes beach was on about 6 episides even though momia was on game of thrones  seceral other series stargate atlantis is the one which made him a star with a huge fanbase he deserves it  i am happy for him this film is all about cgi special effects which for me are quite boring lastly it is a comuc book film whose fanbase is mostly preteens they are all about the mighty dollar at least jason gets to make much more money plus move him up into the alist of action film stars this will allow him to make many more films of his own which is much better than pablum like this,fantasy
i really really wanted to like this moviebut it sucked acting was horrible storyplotvery cheesy some of the imagery was cool however it had an old school might morphing power ranger feel to it if youre wonderingthat is a bad thing ,fantasy
honestly i wasnt impressed the lines acting and cgi were subpar at best this movie tries to be funny clever and epic like spiderman but it all falls a little short and seems like their just trying to hard which ruins the movie,fantasy
im cringing every time protagonists kiss in the middle of the action i just want to die,fantasy
im sick of stupidfull special fx movies with poor developed characters macho behaviour nonsense scripting etc this movie is like tons of low quality production in hollywood just to impress the public with visuals that are good indeed like all the superhero  scifi movies of the last 20 years but in the end it is always the same st boring story with same construction and developmentthe good the bad the winner the loser etca waste of time and money good only for long air trips and inflight entertainment perfect for sleeping momoa is not bad in the end but the machosuperpowered hero with no flaws is really annoying in the end,fantasy
i was prepared for it to be daft wacky nonsense but its badly put together and the cgi looks cheap and unfinished  they couldnt even be bothered shooting something like a scene on a jetty on location its all green screen bilgereminds me of die another day but worseterrible terrible terrible movie,fantasy
to be honest ive never viewed as a major character in the dc universe he was always that weird cousin that everybody just kinda puts up with and halfheartedly oohs and aahs when he tells a dolphin to pull a rope so firstly props to jason momoa for bringing the grit and toughness to this superhero he makes cool if for the first time ever also the movie is beautiful the fight scenes are well shot and the cgi makes every land a picturesque landscape of color and flash also amber heard is absolutely gorgeous in this movie her red hair and outfits pop every time shes on the screen the story however is kind of all over the place how do they stop pollution isnt it a bad thing to let someone die what are these peoples motives the film feels like its a bit too long as well did i enjoy the experience of the movie yes would i watch it again like i would other current superhero films no still great job making a cool and valuable character again in the dc universe,fantasy
directed by james wan written by geoff johns james wan david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick and will beall is a character that many people have long since thought to be an incredibly silly idea he talks to fish and lives underwater he will sometimes fight crimes taking place on the high seas justice league introduced him to the world as a beer chugging bad ass saving the world from aliens no one and i mean nobody thought this movie would have been good or even a success for that matter it was a huge success was the movie any good though eh somewhatthis is a very busy film something is always happening at a fast pace they are having a scene on the beach where willem dafoes character vulko is training jason momoas to fight for the throne in the future the camera is spinning around and around and around this is just one example the underwater scenes are filled with so much detail it is incredible to watch what all these animators are able to accomplish what those hundreds of thousands of animators working overtime for exposure were able to accomplish is impressive i am of the mind that when a movie is this full of cgi it might as well be an animated movie there is almost nothing in it thats real its beautiful and impressive but not realthe thing about this movie is its not a superhero film at least not in the traditional sense its a prophecy film a fantasy film kingdoms warring over the throne its without a doubt a fantasy film it works in those perimeters it delivers this world and all the characters work in simplistic terms the movie is incredibly flashy and wont stop it tells you what youre supposed at every turn while all the visuals are filled with details the script and characters are delivered in the most basic way they have only character trait and they play it well i didnt believe a word of it with the exception of patrick wilson as ocean masterman he plays it up he is acting his ass off most of the time he is solemn and barely shows emotion not as ocean master he is selling the evil and his bigotry against the surface dwellers and his brother he was the best part for me i dont know why but man i laughed at him calling himself ocean master but he was going to be the best ocean master he could be he was true to atlantis and its way of life hes tired of the pollution and he wants to control all the kingdoms to wage war against the surface for their constant crapi didnt feel any suspense because is basically invincible unless hes fighting king orm this is a trend in recent superhero movies i know this is not a superhero film generally where the hero is so powerful that nothing seems to phase them i hate it my favorite heroes have flaws and have to work to win or survive is way too powerful to feel like anything wont go his wayin the end its entirely too long it is entirely too flashy it could have benefited from slowing down just a bit but the visuals are terrific patrick wilson is stealing the show and it is fun for most of the runtime i give this movie a c,fantasy
i watched the film with no expectations either way and to some up  its not garbage but its not greatthere are some ridiculous elements  every characters entrance requires a slow motion taking a helmet off sequence hammy as hell in the realms of nipples on the batsuit there is a lot of stuff thrown in to try force humour into dc that doesnt land or is just awfulthere are some good elements  fight scenes with are good his parents relationship actually means something dolf lundgren being 100 dolf etci would rush to see it but would watch if it was on the tv,fantasy
let me start off my simply putting no i did not like this movie i will get into that later however there is some impressive work done in this movie that does deserve creditthe visuals of the whole film are pretty well done most of what i am referring to takes place in the under water cgi world director james wan has always liked soft blues and strong reds in his movies it is cool to see how that transitioned into an underwater action film the visual world can somewhat be compared to the visual world of james camerons avatarthe action was another crowing jewel in the film the section of the storyboard which was action did better than any other dcu movie everything about it was entertaining and left my attention closely tied to the screen the fighting choreography was very impressivewhen you combine the amazing visuals with creative action you really do find something to awe at if you watch this movie for any reason watch it for thisand i guess jason momoa is a pretty fun actornow for why i did not particularly love this movedid anybody else feel like they were watching a live action anim this film had every clich moment and cheesy line in the book the whole thing is built much like an anim piece corny screen play corny dialogue between characters rushed dialogue rushed story board and corny movie scores that come on too often and too hard not to diss on anim i just dont think it works well within live action hero moviesits tasking for the audience to take any serious moment honestly serious this film was just written with too many cheese filled lines it is easy to feel like you are watching a disney channel orignal moviewith a cool actor like jason momoa you have the opportunity to have some pretty good comic relief though the writers of the film did try to capitalize on this they failed epically to make it worse any funny part of this movie was scored with stupid piano disney style musicthe movies cheese and corn meter skyrocketed as the film went down the montage check list the falling in love montage the training montage the bad guy gearing up montage and enough surprise explosions to make a montageover all i was pretty disappointed with the filmif you ever find your self just wanting to watch a popcorn action flick this one isnt too bad if you ever find yourself wanting to watch a well written and creative film avoid this one at all costs,fantasy
so i have watched and i am ashamed that i almost didnt i almost decided not to because i really hated batman vs superman with a passion was pretty dang good i really hope that 2 happensa lot of people on a different thread of mine said that was crap and all that were we watching the same movie it is the best dceu movie since wonder woman officially a fan of now did not expect the badassery in this one of the best parts of the movie is black manta jumping arthur and mera in that small town they were in my gosh what an immersion the camera work the visuals the sfx the fight choreography james wan is brilliant he knows his superhero movies and his horror films xd good stuff black manta turned out to be a really cool character i thought he was only the movie opener but i was very wrongpatrick wilson as ocean master wow what a performance he is not exactly known for these kinds of movies and he really owned his role reminded me of loki he was not even corny at all just right dolph lundgren was also really good in this movie too hes known for his tough guy brute characters but i really bought his performance in thisamber heard was also great in this thankfully her performance didnt suck in this and she really had some shining moments in this especially the wine scene i say thankfully because i know about her irl status at least i think its true cannot picture depp being a beater just cannot do itthe visual effects were absolutely beautiful i mean they even handled everybody being all floaty underwater very well i mean the hair clothing jewelry the detail is stunning from big and small i was happy that i was able to take even actors who are known for brutal edgy roles seriously like lundgred dafoe momoayes i remember him very well for khal dragoneverything was just done very well any flaw that i may have noticed was very small i noticed how in a flashback vulko was talking to a teenage during pitchfork training about his mother being killed i could tell vulko was lying they never touched back on that later in the film when mother returns i also noticed that the teens acting was not very wonderful wasnt horrible but he did not put enough emotion into itanother thing as the movie was coming to a close i was afraid that black mantas storyline wasnt gonna be revisited in the movie and was very disappointed when the movie ended then the credits happened i take it manta will be the villain in part 2 that was a neat storyline i would have preferred mantas story be revisited during the film but i guess it would have been too muchi was very impressed with how they handled the plot structure they handled the ocean master storyline and mantas very well by having them connect in a particular way and it was very goodone more thing i am happy that i totally bought and meras relationship in the movie they played off each other very well and it all totally worked they had wonderful chemistry meras character was great i really liked her place in the moviei seriously hate that this and the ww franchise are part of the dceu because they are too good for that weak universe they should be licensed elsewhere however that worksone thing that reminded me of my enjoyment is how fast it went by by the time i had paused to do something it was already an hour in and it kinda felt like ten minutesoverall 910 a very watery wonderful ride that really kept everything in check and was brilliantly paced and consistent minus a couple of small errors that are totally forgettable the role of totally belongs to momoa and him alone one of my favorite more lighthearted superhero films i gotta see more,fantasy
this film was a risk in the making well it was a risk worth taking it has some awesome fight scenes under the sea it has some great acting especially from jason memoa its a great movie to watch,fantasy
rented this tonight and was very excited to watch this after about an hour i couldnt take the terrible acting poor storytelling and general cheese factor cmon dc you could have done so much better,fantasy
ive never written a review before but i felt compelled to shortly before the end of this movie i noticed it had a 71 on imdb which is staggeringly generous i now believe that like peerreview film critics must have started a you like mine and ill like yours thing to the detriment of us all lies 1 truth 0i called the casting into question right at the beginning of the movie because the antiaging special effects which were far from special the action sequences that followed were straight out of power rangers 90s the acting screamed green screen the story line was for 8 year olds and it all added up to one big cliched steaming rhymes with curdnow i had no business watching this no business whatsoever because i still have a little electrical activity in my brain and im 42 years old but i fancied a bit of fun and didnt get it i wish id just read a bookl and gone to bed early,fantasy
couldnt continue watching the movie it was too embarrassing to watch i was cringing with every cheesy line from jason momoa also the effects were weak and sometimes even irrelevant,fantasy
nicole kidman dolph lungren michael beach and willem dafoe did a fantastic job in a movie that was a patchwork quilt of previous superheroe movies early in the movie i snickered when the atlanteans were riding seahorses advanced civilization yeah riiightwithout the violence this would have been a childs movie ala percy jackson,fantasy
liked the movie but it would have been a better female character horrible actor and performance,fantasy
what a trainwreckit jumps all over the place it has every single superhero cliche possible and a ton of things just dont make they just dontone more wasted opportunity from dc one more dc superhero movie for the thrash canthey idiots kicked out snyder so they can produce better movies and we got thats garbage,fantasy
reviewi was surprised to see that this movie is in 21st place in alltime box office takings because i really didnt think that it was that amazing jason momoa is the perfect but the script was awful and the music throughout the film really got on my nerves some of the scenes looked great especially on the big screen and the few witty moments were delivered well from momoa but i found the core of the plot to be predictable and a bit annoying in places the whole stepbrother wanting to gain the power to control the seas theme was weak and sidekick mera amber heard seemed to take centre stage during the important parts of the concept more than momoa dolph lundgren put in a decent performance as king nereus alongside patrick wilson king orm but that fly looking baddie manta yahya adbulmateen ii was completely useless and the acting was terrible i liked the relationship between and his father tom curry temuera morrison but nicole kidman seemed a bit out of place as atlanna visually it was a great achievement because it must have been hard to make the characters look like they were actually underwater and some of the action scenes were put together well but its really momoas fresh acting style that saved the day he would have been great in a marvel movie but now hes stuck with dcs it really could do with ragnoraks director taiki waititi touch with all that aside it is a decent watch and its much better than some of the movies that have come out of dcs camp but it wasnt memorable and im glad that i didnt pay top dollar to watch it in the cinema with a sequel due to come out in 2022 its a shame that the same director is making the movie because i cant see it being dramatically different from this one now that is king there are many different avenues that they can take the character but i dont think that the director is willing to take many risks in terms of wit and really letting momoa loose judging by the scenes after the credits its obvious that manta is returning to revenge his dad and the fact that king orm is in a room with a view im sure that he will be returning to gain the throne but it really needs a charismatic character to make this movie something to remember anyway its worth a watch especially if youre a comic book fan but i preferred wonderwoman watchableroundupthis movie was directed by james wan who brought you saw in 2004 dead silence death sentence starring kevin bacon doggie heaven insidious 1  2 the conjuring 1  2 and fast  furious 7 he has quite a versatile filmography which was originally based on horror mysteries so he was a questionable choice to bring this epic movie to the big screen he also produced all of the saw movies annabelle demonic lights out jigsaw annabelle creation the nun and the curse of la llorona so he has a passion for the supernatural genre as this is the highest grossing movie from dc including all of the batman movies it certainly passed all expectations especially after the disappointing justice league movie i just hope they cut down on the visuals and concentrate on a decent plot for the sequelbudget 160200millionworldwide gross 115billiongenre action adventure fantasy scificast jason momoa amber heard willem dafoe patrick wilson nicole kidman dolph lundgren yahya abdulmateen ii temuera morrison lundi lin michael beach and randall park 510,fantasy
trust me it never bore you even a single second every scene in this movie cant be missed and the hard work of director james wan and his team has done its fabulous jason amber patrick has done real hard work and its worth to watchyou wont leave the seats until last frames goes offhats off and dc has made a comeback,fantasy
could barely stand watch it to the end what a mess ,fantasy
im fine with being on the cheesy side considering it was probably marketed to a younger audience but this movie was terrible plenty of comics have been made for kids but done with a lot more finesse the plot was dumb  the acting was ridiculous had jason mamoa  william dafoe not been in it i would have given it 12   still consider that generous,fantasy
loved the movie lots of action  cinematography and really good story line  was a good night in ,fantasy
how this has as great a rating as it does is amazing terrible storytelling subpar acting of supporting characters poor script and cheesy everythinghowever what the movie lacks it made up for in awesome colors and jasons muscle,fantasy
as far as superhero movies go this wasnt too bad the cinematography was the main highlight especially the underwater and battle scenes i like the way they told arthur currybackground story the scenes with his father brother and mentor were all first rate the lead actor was a tad bit wooden in his part and it was cliche ridden but other than that it was a good movie i loved the scene in the bar and the aquarium scene 12 out of ,fantasy
i cant believe what my eyes saw the worst effects in all dc super hero movies lasers explosions are they serious the costumes not that good this movie dont deserve any credit that octopus playing the drums was very ugly,fantasy
the title says it all its not very sophisticated movie but its good for when you want to relax also the visuals were amazing,fantasy
aqua man is another fun super hero movie that came out in 2018 unlike many other super hero films however this one was a true adventure my most favorite aspect about this film are the several wondrous locations goes to reminds me of the video game uncharted throughout his quest the cgi was good overall but some scenes were pretty bad i wish they also gave black manta a better role he seemed to have little to no effect on the story whatsoever perhaps in the sequel he will take on a bigger role jason momoa was great and nailed the rougharoundtheedges,fantasy
 is a bit wooden and a bit cliche but overall a well made action movie that deliver what we would expect and atlantis is a fun topichowever what made extra enjoyable to me is that it does not fight the culture war except for a soft jibe at polluting the oceans i saw some marvel movie and it was increadibly politicized and preachy that so many hollywood movies are preachy and political have made me stop watching hollywood movies by and largeanother aspect where really really excells is that it does not divide the world into good vs evil instead it divides the world into factions pursuing their own self interest with varying degrees of wisdom the main baddie in simply has another opinion of what is best for his faction and does his best to pursue such a course of action but he is not demonized and he is not portrayed as dishonerable unlike in normal hollywood movies that go out of their way to demonize and crush the faction or person that is the designated baddie this was immensely refreshing to me i will definitively check out more movies made by the same companydirectorproducerwriter or whoever made this movie watchable,fantasy
i went into this wanting to hate this movie and i just couldnt the story is old illegitimate son comes home added with lets over take the king and you have every fantasy movie from the 80s and 90s jason momoa amber heard willem dafoe dolph lundgren and nicole kidman collective chemistry really made this movie good not great but good i like the idea of putting a little comedy in this like the scene where arthur was sitting on the lasso of truth in justice league anyway some over the top scenes knocked the the two points off for me anyway i give it a solid 8 for chemistry humor and good action sequence,fantasy
ok computerthis movie really stunk the cgi was overwhelmingly bad the fight scenes were boring the actingwhat acting dont waste your time on this movie,fantasy
i fell asleep 3 times trying to get through this movie it was obnoxious and the casting overall was deplorable the while movie was such a let down on a good note they certainly get 10 starts for a damn good trailer they certainly suckered us in,fantasy
had high hopes for this movie but it was just so ridiculous the underwater world was completely unbelievable its almost like they tried too hard,fantasy
theres a fairly standard storyline but this movie is a winner because of the amazing waterworld the underwater sound the graphics the culture and just the overall attention to detailits really creative and a great experience the fight scenes were also fun and the jokes were good for a 2 hour movie managed to keep me engaged most of the timesomeone new to movies will be blown away but experienced moviegoers might not appreciate it for the storyline but can appreciate it for the aesthetically pleasing spectaclea good popcorn movie,fantasy
the movie was perfect love the creature that protected the trident the story was perfect the casting was fantastic patrick wilson played his role perfectly its one of the best movies of dc comics,fantasy
this is pure dross pish cheesy pishshocking script terrible acting avoid,fantasy
one would think that since aqua man has such a low standing in the comicverse that the cinematic debut would bring him some justice not so this cinematic catastrophe was pure torture to watch  the costuming was reminiscent of star trekland of the lostgodzilla of the 70s and 80s and the graphics were just as bad plot line nope and to make it worse it dredged on for well over 2 hours,fantasy
i thought jason momoa was extremely bad casting but then i saw the preview and it looked amazing so i went in with high hopes unfortunately i was right momoa doesnt look the part and doesnt have the acting ability to sell himself despite this he is stiff and awkwardbut it is not just momoa nicole kidman who has previously turned in decent performances makes no effort even stumbling over her words at timestamuera morrison does okay but the horrible makeup and cg on him makes his parts difficult to watchbut the director has to be the worst offender what the hell is with the csi styles stings and the cringeworthy hair flip as momoa walks through steamthe one star is because i couldnt motivate myself to finish watching the movie,fantasy
how could i possibly encapsulate all this film has to offer better than others before me this film has what i will call venom syndrome which means it switches genres every 1020 minutes it seems to have no clue what it wants to be and it also seems there were several writers tasked with certain types of scenes and it isglaringly obviouslike others have said there are several scenes where its like watching a liveaction little mermaid in which the romance is more painful to watch than hayden christensen harass natalie portman into stockholm syndrome in attack of the clonesthen it tries to emulate star wars in many ways even underwater spacebattles make a brief statement on mans environmental impact once in a while turn into a freaking waterbending prophecied one introduce some gadgets that make spy kids look practical apparently exists within the monster verse with kaiju and can we please talk about the cheesy armor the soldiers from atlantis wear good god it looks like they went to the value bin at the studio and took out the rejects for tron and super mario brosthe best things i can say about this film is the cinematography is very nicely done and the special effectscgi is rather excellent save for some deaging for flashbacks the hair effects underwater are noticeably superior to any ive personally seen and the color palate is spectaculartldr this film is a visual spectacle but with a schizophrenic script subpar writing and some truly incompetent chemistryacting it is like experiencing the fever dream of gary busey himself and it is not exactly easy,fantasy
seriously who gave this 9 or 10 stars its power rangers at their worst dont waste any time with this movie,fantasy
terrible cgi acting and story i dont know why dc dont get a good company to do the cgi it always looks like crappy early 20 animation the acting was awful the storyline was basic and linear dont spend any money on this movie wait for it to come on a streaming service,fantasy
always been more of a dc fan then marvel but have to say this movie delivered a marvel like feel to it cheesey superhero lines like always lots of explosions good villian check and check overhyped a bit but delivered an awesome movie a little long but hey another side effect of superhero movies,fantasy
all the slow mo the terrible jokes a truly awful script scenes without contextlaughed for all the wrong reasons not an awful film thoughwhen meira plays the flute on the boat incredible must have been a joke,fantasy
i was so disappointed i love dc their comics are far better than marvels but lets be honest marvel is killing it with its movies i have hoped for the same thing with dc i have actually been a fan of most dc movies i absolutely loved justice league wonder woman was great but i could do without professor lupin being the villain with his jacked god body and little nerdy head still great though suicide squad was good except for the weird intros for each character and the dumb witch villain people are going to hate me but batman vs superman the extended edition was honestly really goodlands dead last i rarely write reviews and i only do it if i feel strongly about a film and feel other reviewers got it wrong everything i read was dcs best film better than wonder woman dcs headed in the right direction now they were all lies like i said i liked all the other dc movies why they got criticized so harshly and this is praised i am baffled from beginning to the very end it was awful i would not even recommend renting this it was a waste of a night for me i will say if you like transformers then youll probably like this dumb jokes a lot of special effects zero character development and a poor story fits the transformer mold to me,fantasy
 is nothing like the other superheros we have recently seen come from the dc universe traditionally this mighty king was known as an aryanlooking atlantean who wore orange and green spandex in addition to his striking fashion he wielded an intimidating golden trident representing power in defence of his kingdom however in the most recent movie this stalwart image is replaced with a powerful hawaiian who is covered in tribal tattoos and shaggy hair this change brought shock to dc fans across the world they were expecting tradition similarity to the comic books that they so dearly loved this is one of the many reasons why is receiving questionable reviews if evaluated solely on entertainment a story about a forbidden child who returns to claim the throne from a tyrant and saves billions of lives in the process the movie sounds extremely interesting however the plot was weak the acting was far from perfect and aside from the occasional surprise the 2  hour movie was fairly predictablejust years ago the mere mention of creating an movie was quite literally laughed upon in hbos entourage series as he was considered relatively useless to the dc family however in a year when no fewer than 10 superhero movies were created ranging from incredibles 2 to black panther it suddenly seemed logical to give life to such a well known hero when i initially saw the previews for this movie i was ecstatic i loved reading books about as a child and i considered him an inspiring hero however as the movie began i better understood why the entourage series considered him a joke first and foremost there were key details and storylines that did not follow the comic books in any way shape or form for example the true from the comics was a broken man when he was first introduced to atlantis yet he overcame an internal struggle and became the man we know him as jason momoa on the other hand is a boistrus lad who enjoys drinking and fighting with little to no care in the world when we think of the dc heroes who comes to mind a man of matchless strength named superman a human vigilante known as batman or how about one of the very first female superheros who is generally known as wonder woman the common ground that these three have is their ability to fight for truth and right in a magnificent way due to their extraordinary gifts and talents is considered by many to be the butt of pop culture jokes as stated by ign because he simply is a man who can swim really fast talk to fish and breathe underwater although this is extremely useful while underwater in his kingdom many of his talents and gifts do not extend beyond the realm of atlantis his strength and instincts are quite impressive regardless of where he is however in the earthly realm he is not much of a superhero because of this many consider him quite useless especially if the dc heroes were suddenly needed for example to defend the world from an alien invasion as we commonly see in modern filmsas the movie went on i found myself bored a times and able to predict scenes fairly consistently the events were great in theory but there was simply too much plot and it all moved too fast to really get attached to anyone or anything by the time you begin to appreciate something another equally important scene happens and you quickly forget what had just taken place marvel in comparison does a phenomenal job of weaving together scenes full of action with simple and informative scenes through this we are able to understand and come to love certain characters rather than just watching them constantly fight throughout the course of the moviefinally a storyline with as much anticipation as brings immediate interest and enthusiasm however throughout the movie certain pieces do not fall into place and we begin reminiscing on the comics and the heros that we idolized all those years ago i would recommend this movie if you are interested in the dc universe and want to watch a movie that doesnt require much emotional investment however not only was the plot extremely weak the acting was par at best if you are interested in a memorable movie that will touch your heart or inspire you this is far from what you would enjoy,fantasy
it was all just jason momoa hype nothing more we know he has micronesian origin but was that haka element really necessary the cgi and acting tried too hard to make people feel hype i guess marvel set the bar too high,fantasy
so bad and cheesy that actress amber is the worst im so sad heres my doe eyes i would never think a skinny sad girl could ever be powerful and she plays the victim perfectly hey 5 million dollarsterrible film glad i didnt pay for this crap,fantasy
this movie had a ton of really cool artistry going on my only issues were the predictability factory and the violent war aspect haha so i guess i had a problem with basically the entire thing it was pretty though if you liked john wick 2 youll probably love it,fantasy
not to yuck someone elses yum but i feel cheated out of money the only things this movie had going for it were colorful effects monsters and pretty people if youre into hunky dudes with pantene prov commercial hair and if youre really into glow in the dark outfitsso its enjoyable to watch if you can turn off your brain while youre watching it the story was sooooo bad predictable from start to finish boring 2d characters plot holes and flat actingalso the themes in this movie were old fashioned in some really disturbing ways without spoilers one of the characters  a female character actually defends her own arranged marriage puke why is this relevant to an american audiencemy suggestion if youre gonna watch it watch it on mute youll roll your eyes less,fantasy
plot is thin dialogue is atrocious every 10 minutes someone stops to tell a story to make this try to make senses,fantasy
amber heard needs a new hair dresser boooooooooooooooo,fantasy
the movie was was an mix of cliches and highly predictableit didnt contain one scene which was unpredictablethe story telling was pathetic and and bits of animation and action skimpily covered its shortcomingsthe fact that it managed to survive so long is a living testimony to the power big studio houses holdthat they could even manage to garner decent reviews shows the gullibility of the masses if this continues we will have a hugely popular movies but not anything worth watching rip good movies,fantasy
i love superhero movies and shows and this is the lowest ive ever rated one since the iron fist series dont get me wrong 5 stars still means it was worth the watch but i probably wont be rewatching this movie there were two positives about the film the first is the action which is unquestionably amazing its very wellcoordinated that i couldnt help but feel awed by some of the scenes even while i wasnt emotionally invested in the scenethe second good aspect was momoa his devilmaycare attitude and raw prowess translate well to the big screen this new take on is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre except that it was already fresh in justice league and he isnt ever given anything better than weve already seen even in his own movie momoa does well in spite of it but the character was not written as well as he should have been in fact even the emotional scenes where momoa could have flexed his acting talents were given to a different actor by only occurring in flashbacks with a younger actor its difficult to get emotionally invested in a movie when it seems like the main character doesnt feel strongly about anythingas for the other characters wilson and mateen both perform decently not outstanding since their onedimensional characters had no depth but also having enough potential to keep the viewer engaged if not satisfied the story occasionally tries to touch on the villains emotions but the limited screen time never allows them to dive in i truly believe the movie should have toned down the epic war scenes and focused on establishing as a character along with introducing an intimidating lowthreat villain with a little depth like was done in spiderman homecoming they could have easily done this by keeping black manta as the sole villain then they could saving the jawdropping spectacles for 2 where oceanmaster would be the main villain and they could have more screen time to explore oceanmasters ruthlessness and dynamic with combining them into one film made for a movie so rushed that neither villains story had any emotional weightas for other actors this is where we start getting from bad to worse not that any performances were outright bad but they were certainly given horrible dialogue nearly all of the dialogue for mera and occasional lines for everyone else were so cliched andor cringeworthy that it honestly makes you think the movie would have been better if the character didnt say anything at all at that moment the worst moment was the pinocchio joke the joke itself was great but the minutelong explanation of the joke actually had me squirming out of my seat with embarrassment for the entire superhero genre some of the other jokes were fine but all of the subversive humor was awful subversive humor has already been overused in the marvel series so even though it was new for the dc series it still felt contrived and unoriginal in a movie with an entire franchise riding on it screenwriting is not where you should start making budget cutson the subject of budget cuts the budget could have been significantly smaller if a lessknown actor was cast in the place of defoe defoe is a great actor whose talents were absolutely wasted in this onedimensional emotionless character though he would have been good spread out with more screen time in my 2 movie idea again no fault of the actor but definitely a fault of the screenwriterif it seems like my review is overly harsh its because the superhero genre has given us a high standard to expect this movie fell short in every single aspect and it is definitely the fault of the poor screenwriting warner brothers shouldnt have hired two relatively inexperienced lowbudget writers for such a highbudget film,fantasy
i thought this was a little kids showthen found out it was meant to be for adultboring fake silly waste of time if popcorn was not eatenthink high ratings are taking the micky,fantasy
this was such a bummer of a movie i grew up with justice league and absolutely love all things dc not this movie i couldnt last 20 minuets of it i couldnt stand the horrible acting and the story line was jumpy and sucked i got so tired of looking at that guy flip his dumb hair everywhere thats not even what the real looks like hes blonde they stuck with the true looks of all the other characters but not him truly a disappointment,fantasy
kal drogo   jason brings excitment to whatever he does but everything underwater looked cartoonish wilsons overacting was also cartoonish black manta was cool but minimized as a sevondary villain nicole kidman sucked wonder woman is still the best dc film in my opinion i havent seen shazam yet,fantasy
ok i loved xena princess growing up so youd think id enjoy this garbage and its awful photoshop loral ad like graphics but this was paaaaaainful,fantasy
first time i have ever written a review i felt like i had to share and hopefully prevent others from wasting over two hours of there lifei always use imdb as a guideline when to watch a film or not this was one of the rare occasions when the rating is way outawful script awful acting over two hours of my life wasted and im still watching it now somebody make it stop pleeeaaassseeee ,fantasy
im not sure what the hype is here this film is terribly from start to the highly anticipated finish it has to be the lamest superhero movie of all time i mean the protagonist here is even annoying the guy that plays him looks like a wrestler and acts just as badly as one too the bad guys are so lame some look like they would fit in a gi joe film and some look like they would fit in a star wars or space scifi world just when i thought it couldnt get any lamer than the thor actor and character they make a full length movie with an actor who is possibly the worst protagonist of all time the lines are lame the humor attempts are cliche and not funny in the least i also felt a bit childish like some executive let their son help with the writing cause its that shallow and the only thing that is funny about it is the costumes and  i also dont know what people are raving over with the visual i think its horrible it looks so unrealistic you cant even imagine the characters are there and there are many movies that get it right including some of the other super hero films its not that they didnt also use cgi but they certainly didnt abuse it either next thing is the actors dolph lungren his movie career was over years ago i think maybe even in the same year he started as hes pretty much always been a b action actor and even then hes pure cheese and his movies unbearably lame i cant believe hes still in movieswilliam defoe lets get serious here i would buy him as an alcoholic retired cop or dirty senior cop he just look so out of character and place in this movieamber heard is terrible as usual i mean every role she gets she either goes too far or the polar opposite she doesnt want to be there or its a simple script reading i found in this film she even gives off body language like shes nervous and sometimes like i said she doesnt seem to be into it at all patrick wilson looks so out of place in this and to me hes always been nothing but a second rate fill in actor not fit to be one of the main in a movie hes ruined a lot of films for mei love nicole kidman but not even she could keep this film above water i wouldnt recommend this film to the worst of my enemies as watching this is a cruel punishment the way people here dont seem to care about content and dont seem to understand the rating system,fantasy
this was awful cliche to the max and a god awful storyline everything about this movie was crap so predictable and so boringi watched it till the end just so i could say i watched it all as im warning people off of itif you want the worst kind of cheesy and cliche watch battlefield la or this its really that bad,fantasy
bad acting bad jokes bad cgi we didnt even finish watching it because it was boring and i could care less about any of the characters cant believe it has an above 7 average rating,fantasy
slightly entertaining big budget b movie lives in the ocean but this was about as deep as a puddle was there a story i dont really remember its like they decided to just throw a bunch of cgi and corny jokes at the wall to see what would stick,fantasy
this movie fell short for me the effects are decent and the ocean looks pretty but the bad acting and bland seenitbefore storyline overshadows any positives the chemistry between actors is forced and the stakes seem low no surprise for a dc movie overall is mediocre and a one and done for me,fantasy
first ill give this movie credit where its due at times it is visually captivating and quite innovative probably wouldve been cool to see in imax unfortunately they exhausted the hell out of cgi which seemed mostly unnecessary the screenplay was outright terrible poor character development and super cheesy and generic superhero movie lines jason momoa did a decent job but the rest of the cast were not a good fit eg nicole kidman patrick wilson not that they are bad actors perse but not the superheroaction movie type i checked out after watching about 30 minutes and had a hard time forcing myself to pay attention for the remainder which felt like 10 hours,fantasy
this movie is good for sunday after tough rave when your brain is potato,fantasy
i guess movies like this get made because of the profits to the studios and the investors regardless of how trite these over the top superhero films have become is text book formulaic and reminded me of a combination of gladiator star wars and finding nemo  lol i quickly became fatigued and could not finish it,fantasy
oh my goodnessif a nerd ate star wars jurassic park how to train your dragon and the little mermaid then pooped it out you would have actually that would probably make a better movie then this i dont even know how people say they like the special effects i expected better than this wonder woman was the last good movie they will ever make poor poor jason he did the best he could with what he had to work with they basically explained everything you ever wanted to know in a single conversation the movie was paced terribly you talk to someone for five seconds then boom something explodes my favorite part is when this italian guy who is struggling to get up after he is crushed by a building gets saved by then the man just walks away completely unaffected or maybe the part where freaks out while dangling from the edge of a small building after he literally just jumped out of an airplane speaking of italy i lived there for three years and the scene in sicily looks absolutely nothing like italy but i mean if youve lived in one town in america your whole life stereotypically think that all italians have pinocchio books lying around and can sit for almost three hours without using your brain which can obviously see that every scene looks painfully over rehearsed and dont care that the main villain calls himself the ocean master you might actually like this movie ill give them this if it was anymore editedanimated it would make a great barbie movie,fantasy
hi im jason momoa duhwillem defoe has a man bun,fantasy
absolutely terriblebig e for trying im gonna watch green lantern instead as im learning to ride a shark,fantasy
on this movie and the guy who wrote it and whoever wrote suicide squad i hate your face,fantasy
i enjoyed the film but it was let down by the terrible performance and plastic faced kidman,fantasy
 is overstuffed particularly the first hour but i still consider it as a miracle considering the fact that it is the first not bad dc film since man of steel,fantasy
as i watched the movie i quickly realized it was going to be a very bad movie but as the movie went on i realized it had some interesting potential that could have made it a really good movie you have a solid foundation with jason mamoa and some good supporting actors such as willem dafoe so you have some talent to work with but the storyline and scripting were way off the underwater dichotomy was too simplistic for a super advanced society they have all that high end tech and are biologically advanced but had the political mindset of a feudal system cmon even the primary weapons were medieval a trident pretty silly plot devises that just made the movie more awkward the black manta brine and fishermen kingdoms were too power rangerish especially black manta the fight scene between black manta and totally took me back to the 90sthe over the top costume and voice over was hilarious rather than threatening or intimidating despite all that weirdness what i thought had potential was the pushback from the atlanteans due to the over harvesting and damage of sea life and pollution of the oceans that was a footnote to the stereotypical struggle for who gets to sit on the throne if they had focused more on the struggle between man vs atlantean conflict i think that would have been a more interesting story dont hang this on jason mamoathis is poor writing and bad directing pure and simple,fantasy
i was in the minority of imdb reviewers who liked the underrated justice league and now with the latest movie featuring jason momoa as i am in the minority again this time having a far more negative reaction than most peoplewhile the cgi action is sometimes fun the dialogue is excruciatingly bad embarrassingly bad this is particularly evident with amber heard who hasnt developed the skill of more experienced actors like nicole kidman and willem dafoe to find a way to speak drivel with conviction amber seems terrible in this but i dont know how much of that is her and how much is the wretched verbiage she is forced to spewpeople are going crazy for the muscly momoa i was underwhelmed by him in justice league and while he certainly has some amount of charm he fails to make particularly memorablethe story is predictable some of the action works some doesnt everything thats not action is painful to sit throughi did notice that the movie is very much filmed for 3d perhaps thats why i was underwhelmed by a lot of the action it was more designed for effects than fun i do suspect i would have enjoyed this more in 3d i also probably would have enjoyed it more if dolphins dubbed in all the dialogue,fantasy
good movie main plot is a bit similar to black panther go watch it anddont pollute seas,fantasy
 is a dummy who has the redhead and his mother guide his actions every step of the way he did nothing that inspired heroism why should he be king why thoughredhead has zero chemistry with why is petty squabbling a form of flirtation in an eventually forced relationship where for some reason they inexplicably are in love i suppose it is because they are ridiculously good looking expect to read about the split in people atlantis two months down the roadthey explained every major plot point out loud so even the most airheaded if individuals did not have to lean over and ask their significant other what just happenedfail,fantasy
i am not what you would call a dc movie fan but this one has thoroughly impressed mefirst i will point out what kept me from giving this a fullblown 10 the depth of the characters of the main characters could have dived in deeper next though the action was well done and didnt hinder the flow of story i wouldnt have mind them skipping a couple of the scenes and allow the story to be carried forward with more dialogdepththat said i knew what i was getting into was going to be a fullblown action and where that is concerned it did not disappoint there were no laggy overdrawn out sequences it was interesting visuals and effects i am ever so grateful i did not have to watch some form of a car chasenow the good stuff the creativity of atlantis was stupendously beautiful and supreme eye candy i was ever so delighted and my eyes feasted on the dazzling colors coupled with architectural imagery bravonicole kidman ability to bring emotional depth thus was perfectly paired with the funloving nature of jason momoa and resulted with injecting a lot of heart into the filmi really enjoyed this movie,fantasy
 has many faults between its messy script bloated stature and the fact that it is just too freaking long you think it would be a total miss however what lacks in all of these categories it makes up for with trying actors and jaw dropping action scenes the film is predictable at time and has quite a few cliches but even with a hard to follow setup or hard to watch depending on how you look at it leaves you cheering at the end by a pure sense of an underdog story line the film has flaws as does its protagonist but by the end itll win your heart even after the struggles it has made you deal with along the way the first half of the film can seem like a drag at times but the second half makes up enough for it it isnt perfect but its a decent try for dc studios and one that will definitely not be forgottenmy rating 72510,fantasy
going into i was pretty hyped not only is he an overlooked superhero but it has james wan behind it while many of us know james wan for horror films he definitely delivered a great movie in it certainly is not a flawless movie by any means but it is one hell of a good time i still think wonder woman is the best dceu film but this one is without a doubt second the film is a beauty with great cinematography and visuals the actions scenes are very well done especially since 90 of them are underwater the cast is great as well with jason mamoa and amber heard being the best choices for  mera their chemistry is amazing with one another and it definitely makes them more likable yahya as black manta was also another amazing cast choice the film is definitely over the top but its mad so be over the top the cheesy over the top moments just made this film more entertaining in my opinionlike i said this movie is by no means flawless and does come with some weak aspects the writing in the film could of been improved and some of the one liners were weak one of the weakest aspects for me was the score the score was very basic and forgettable if it had a better score such as wonder womans it might push it over the top to be the best dceu film all in all this film is beyond entertaining and anyone can have a good time seeing it,fantasy
9 for visuals 1 for plot is that atlantean guard still with his head down the toilet,fantasy
i hate the beginning with the plastic faces of nicole kidman  morrison couldnt they find other younger actors plot mess too much going on and the watcher cant follow them as movie speed is high too much fighting scary creatures same old story of whose best for the throne etc i should have given 110 but i show mercy ,fantasy
if youre over 10 years old and male youre not the target audience for this film except you came here for momoas abs in that case youre goodthe movie is really bad it can be enjoyed to make fun of the cgi but dont expect good writing acting or anything else dc attheir highest,fantasy
psa finally got myself to watch and i cant imagine someone actually enjoying this absurd concoction of green lanternesque cgi acting that would embarrass the lowest paid hallmark actor and chemistry more awkward than hillbilly cousins getting married on a reality tv showtruly baffled why this wasnt scoffed at the way that green lantern was because i cant imagine anyone whos not on exxtasy enjoying a single minute of this highly commercialized scificomedy that shouldve only been broadcasted on the syfy channel on a side note captain marvel was great go see it,fantasy
srupid me not to have read the reviews and cast list la kidman with inflated breasts all washed up i wish her career was ghastly instant delete,fantasy
james wan really brings a tidal wave of action and adventure for first solo film the epic scale of the seven kingdoms to the ferocious looking trench make you believe its an alien world present on earth the cast from jason mamoa to amber heard yahya abdulmateen to patrick wilson keep you enthralled from beginning to end it truly is a heroes journey definitely a recommend from me,fantasy
the plotline is meh the acting is meh the flashy cgi effects will give you epilepsy even if you dont have itmost of the time it felt as if i was watching a pg13 disney moviethe dialogues are so poorly written it was hard to even listen to them half the timei tried my best to like it i did alas the cringe was just damn too much,fantasy
i love the fact this movie trys to be everything but a good movie i cant tell if im watching a bad sitcom star wars an 80s movie a michael bay movie if anything a good power rangers movie,fantasy
i am writing a stern email to rotton tomatoes demanding 20 cash 65 fresh who are you letting review movies on your website 3 year oldsthe dialogue is slightly better than the sounds my schnauzer makes when he sees a squirrel the editing seems to have been the work of four drunken sailors working in different alleyways and then just splicing each ones work together in order of who has the most teeth missing i thought the fx were ok but that just made the experience all the more crueland then there is nicole kidmani thought you were worthy of love once upon a timedont buy this movie dont rent this movie dont even speak its name,fantasy
2 stars only because i like mamoa if he wasnt in this it would be zero starswhere to start1 terrible dialogue2 typical zack snyder overuse of cgi3 a plot as thin as paper4 predictable from the start5 barely any character development so you never truly care who lives and who dies6 steals heavily from marvelreally just a bad movie,fantasy
which i never do and i really like jason mamoa but this is just the most generic inane overcgid underwritten recycle of other superhero movies so much exposition about tridents and politics and next to nothing about the characters except the first ten minutes about mom and dad an awkwardly youthified waste of nicole kidman and jango fett and dude amber heard aka poison ivy is smoookiingg hot and wtf with indifference to her and zero explanation of how they know each otherthe coolest thing about is his connection with fish which is completely overlooked in an opening sequence involving a machine gun fight the only interesting scene in the first 30 minutes takes place in an aquarium when aquatyke is being bulliedthe underwater talking and flying and armpit sniffing was unbearable and im just getting going here i cant beleive the script made it to screen,fantasy
at last a decent adventureaction movie something which hasnt been seen for a long time a film with an understandable plot with minute by minute action and a great cast of wellknown actors jason momoa fits the bill well as a welcome new hero who gets clobbered most of the time but keeps coming back for moreyou cannot go wrong spending a few hours with dc comics is the new marvelous,fantasy
this movie is boring has some of the worst cgi ive ever seen in a movie that costs this much and has the stupid wannabe marvel comedy that falls flat much more often than it works this is the worst dceu movie by far,fantasy
the 6th instalment in the dc extended universe begins dc films road to recovery after the vomitous justice league with more emphasis on individual character stories rather than trying to build a shared universe its favourable fare with critics  over a billion dollar gross on boxoffice may appear as if the studio is starting to get things right but for me dceus latest is as troublesome as any of their previous entriesthe story follows arthur curry the humanborn heir to the underwater kingdom of atlantis who after learning that his halfbrother is seeking to unite the underwater kingdoms against the surface world goes on a quest to prevent a war between the ocean  land but the adventure he embarks on ultimately compels him to come to terms with his own identity and lead him to discover whether hes entirely worthy of fulfilling his destiny of becoming a kingdirected by james wan saw the conjuring  furious 7 is gorgeous to look at but the plot  characters remain as underdeveloped as ever wans direction keeps things in motion even though the narrative lacks a consistent flow and hes at his best during the thrilling trench segment that may be the films only highlight the ecological themes addressed in the film is a welcome element too but this particular aspect is only glanced at not exploredthe plot packs a predictable outline character arcs arent handled well enough to make us care dialogue is plainly awful action spectacle is ludicrously fun but also emotionally hollow and its bloated runtime is severely felt at times the impressive bits here are the wonderfully detailed set pieces the lush underwater photography with its vivid camerawork  bright lighting and the vital inputs from the vfx teams as they together bring these deepsea kingdoms to life with all their aquatic glorythe film packs a starstudded cast in jason momoa amber heard patrick wilson nicole kidman willem dafoe dolph lundgren and others but all performances are mediocre at best momoa reprises the titular role and though he looks the part and is the right person to don the suit he still fails to embody his character from insideout the swag is there but there is no charisma kidman on the other hand stands out solely due to her bewitching screen presence and the rest provide fine support in their respective roleson an overall scale is neither a strong standalone entry nor does it bear any positive signs of a promising future for dceu the film provides sufficient dose of cgi effectsladen entertainment that casual filmgoers wont mind hell few may even enjoy its unabashed silliness however those looking for substance beneath the surface are probably going to be disappointed for this waterlogged mess is as confused in its approach as it is convoluted in its plotting in short is yet another middling chapter in the middling dc extended universe,fantasy
i am glad i didnt pay to see this  even watching it for free i felt ripped off i was bored and unimpressed  that all i have to say  what a waste considering how good it could have been script you must have a good script  its basic,fantasy
loved it and is fine as helli love the graphics but his fight scenes when hes under water could have been more heroic more badass,fantasy
i love comic books i didnt want to like this as he isnt how should look however it is a damn enjoyable movie romp actioneffectscomedydrama it hits the right spots not the best dc movie but in the top three,fantasy
the premise is simple and straightforwardunderwater world reminds me of avatar except we have known sea creatures as pets and vehiclesthe adventure part is short but good enough to make sense and to progress the storyfor some reason i have a feeling that the black dude which father died in the submarine is added content  filler content and is really similar to black pantheri would say that would be one of the weak points of this moviei wish getting that trident was a bit harderhe was kicked around couple of times and thats itit would have been so much better if he and that creature fought really hard and he was injured quite a bit and as they take a break cuz of exaustion the start the chit chat and the creature has a change of heartyounger brother storyline was kind bland aka his motivation for wanting war was mehsomething people cant relate to at allsure pollution is badbut we cant really imagine that personally since we are the pollutersstill100 times better than black panther which is being praised by so many news outlets and biased movie critics even with his very bad looking suit is still a far more interesting and better character than the black panther one,fantasy
when you write a review when youre still watching the movie two things may be apparent 1 youre overly excited about the movie 2the movie is really that badthe latter is true of this awful piece of badly acted terribly scripted crapoh god what a load of crap,fantasy
i do not recommend this for anyone the outcomes after watching is headache and wasting time i did not find anything interesting,fantasy
a must watch the action scenes are incredible acting is also good a awesome movie from dc afterworse justice league,fantasy
because it was a boring movie  yes it needed capital letters that is how boring it wasabsolutely no story line or depth just depends on special effects to enthrall users but fails miserably save your money and wait for it on some streaming service so you can fast forward right through the movie and also then save time4 of us watched it and 4 of us thought it was not worth the paper the ticket was printed on,fantasy
i dont even know where to begin i truly regret watching this movie because i cannot erase this traumatic experience from my mindthe structure of the movie is completely ridiculous the viewer knows too much about the relationship between the mother and the father and their forbidden love but we know nothing about skills and not enough about his childhoodthe dialogues are not even worth commenting on they are not funny but seem very stupid and there is nothing content in themi give this movie 2 stars because of the visuals the underwater landscapes are done very nice but cannot save this movie at allthis is on the line between satire and serious movies,fantasy
after the poor run of justice league and a few other dc movies there was little hope that this movie will do well add in the fact that the movie is about who is to many quite unpopular and that most of the movie time is spent underwater something that is very difficult to depict yet they have somehow not only pulled all of this off they have managed to make it into arguably the best dceu moviethe story is about arthur gaining king status in the underwater kingdom of atlantis and his endeavours to stop the nation wage war against land dwellers it is packed with amazing fights adventure and a wonderful underwater world and its creatures there is quite a dynamic in the characters and it is good to see that some minor characters also get their chance to shine without going into spoilers theres even a scene where nobodysoldiers have a say in the outcome of a major plot decisionthe area where the movie lacks is dialogue it is sometimes quite cheesy and it is clear that dc is trying to add a little humour to the movie sadly it doesnt seem to work in this situation in any case it is not tooo badup until now i had considered man of steel to be the best movie of the dceu but this to me is much better that means to me it is a lot better than most of mcu movies as well a very high rewatch value and recommended for everyone,fantasy
how is this over 7 star this underwater treasure hunting star wars bull is pretty much the worst superhero movie ever on par with batman v superman all cliches no logic,fantasy
while this is arguably the second best dceu film any reviewer giving this over a 6 has very low expectations for cinema furthermore i warn anyone with limited entertainment budget to watching future entries in the dceu at the cinema until you hear from reviewers you usually agree withthe movie was fun but i found the developement of the characters lacking the villian wasnt intriguing in anyway some of the visual were jarringly bad alsomother father and altantian mentor saved the movie from being just a campy kids movie it also did a great job of delivering the back story of the history of the underwater kingdomsfor something you are going to fork other cinema money for it is 4 for home watching i would give a 6 anything 5 and below you should avoid at the cinema in the opening 2 week or altogether at cinema but for home viewing i would recommend especially if you have hope that future dceu movies will be better,fantasy
this is by far the worst comicbased big production movie which came out in the last decade the acting as well as the dialogue are poor at best the director just did a horrible job except for the special effectsdo not waste your time,fantasy
this movie is the best dc movie i have ever seen the beautiful view under the sea give my the same feeling as my first time saw the movie avatar,fantasy
i had no expectations for this movie but people really liked this so i watched it this is like a syfy channel caliber movie i would say its comparable to a movie like sharknado everything about this movie is bad the cgi looks like a 8 year old did it,fantasy
this movie is pure fun ofcourse it is scifi and do not expect nothing less but it was pure fun,fantasy
a lot of chi and no substance i turned off when i saw an octopus playing the drums,fantasy
the film was entertaining i am getting irritated however with overpowered characters such as antlana in the beginning of the film who manages to take on 20 of atlantis elite soldiers without so much as a scratch or bruise to show for her victory this is so typical of the modern feminist age we live in where men struggle for their victories women appear untouchableblack manta looked like something straight out of a power rangers movie and the actor who played him was rather blandthe special effects and cast of fantastic creatures was truly a highlight of the film  every few minutes there were new creatures revealed which came into a might clash with each other in the final epic battle of the film i absolutely loved itaurthurs character seemed believable as far as his development went throughout the film save the last line of the film when he said i am to this i just cringed he did not need to refer to himself by this name i thought the film did a great job at improving the character from the comics up until this last stupid line i wish it was just not there,fantasy
i didnt enjoy this movie it was wack 110 would not recommend to a friend but maybe an enemy though,fantasy
ganz schlechter film wie ein zu teures videispiel schauspielerische leistung auch unterirdisch,fantasy
absolutely terrible script and a cginightmarei find it completely unbelievable when anyone can give this at a top rating,fantasy
the cgi was too simple too cheap as dc and marvel fan dc doing it very bad against marvelit was a movie with a story but not so much qualitywhen i saw the vilian i saw my power rangers years from the 90s i laughed so hardit was too cheap for dc,fantasy
wont watch it again that is for sure there are some good moments but the whole is nothing special,fantasy
the most epic movie of the last 88 years for sure and theres an octopus playing the drums,fantasy
i came in with high hopes since this movie got some pretty good reviews i left sorely disappointed the script is wooden with characters making nonsensical decisions solely for the purpose of moving the plot along the dialogues are terrible like theyre written by middle schoolers and the perplexing music choices that do not match the scenes one bit the only saving grace is the amount of effort and creativity they put into building an underwater fantasy world which not many movies have done before ill give them thatbut i simply cannot understand how this movie got such a high score astroturfing maybe,fantasy
one of the most brilliant and spectacular cgi i have seen ain a long time the director james wan did an amazing job turning a character that was a laughing stock for world into something as formidable as this the cast was equally admirable jason mamoa as provides the character with a new edge ones thats a liitle bit defiant,fantasy
the story was so predictable its crazy black manta was totally pointless the love story was way out of place and forced now i like cgi and it can really add to a movie but in this one there was way too much and it was creepy at times why they need to cgi a persons face just because they are under water is beyond me it takes you out of the movie the fight scenes were subpar why were they riding on dinosaurs with no explanation then the trench had dinos too why not explain that the hype around this movie is undeserved it is fine to watch at home but not as good as some people make it sound,fantasy
another super dude super babe movie wow grab a six pack and some buttered cornsit back and watch the flash glitter  glitzjason momoa carried the cast literally,fantasy
title says it all save the time and money for a good movie,fantasy
i had very low expectations going in because of dc films track record wonder women was an above average action movie with casting choices working phenomenally but beyond that it fell short of the competition and personal expectations  however really brings many things i love about movies together well while in my opinion wonder women would be a better action hero like movie than does a good job job with this still but also bringing elements the other films including wonder women simply lacked it has great and cheesy humor brings the science fiction to the screen more than just a comic book esq way but with an expanded hint of mythology and tech and it takes itself less seriously while still bringing the notion that everything is on the line in a more marvel fashion huge fan of jason momoa too and thought he did a fantastic job portraying the underrated superhero and amber heard took my skepticism that she would just be a tacked on side kick and threw that notion pleasantly out the window too i highly recommend to anyone who enjoys superhero films and i personally was happy to pay to see it,fantasy
this movie makes no sense has the whit of a 10 year old but it is so entertaining i died every time the wall exploded because the writer had no idea how to transition the scene this movie is so bad its good even though i put a 4 i recommend you watch this its some dumb fun the stars are just in terms of actual quality,fantasy
soo overrated and stupid could have done much better very typical movie,fantasy
weird cgi romcom masking itself as a anime monstersuperhero movie with a strange emo sound track,fantasy
the best dc movie so far but sadly choke full of sjw dog whistlesthe left political agenda was evident and took you out of the movie quite oftenit did leave a bad tasteif it wasnt filled with this it was going to be a nice simple predictable retelling of the same storybut hey we cant just leave movies to be movies,fantasy
from an economists point of view this movies is a great stimulous for aggregate demand and its images are proof of the power of specialization,fantasy
good screenplay and directing visual effects were good too except some parts such as the time its shows sun in the morning above the sea but it was in a good level and little lower than mcu  acting was good jason momoa was stunning and well fitted for this character and other main characteres were good too except father i think he wasnt in the level of other actors this is not a masterpiece its a above average movie because story was fully predictable trailer contains most of movie best parts and the main problem for this movie was that it contains many comic movies cliches which it should have some of them but not this muchat all this movie is good entertaining and exciting in the level of black panther or a little lower its not in a same place as the avengers series or guardians of the galaxy but as i said befor its a good movie,fantasy
i had such high hopes for this movie and it just fell short i think mostly this is down to my age i had hoped the movie would be slightly more adult than it isjason shines in this role and is by far my favourite yahya also did really well in his role as black lantern unfortunately i found the cgi used on other actors facial features somewhat distracting they all looked like theyd had bad plastic surgery at timesthe underwater scenes were fantastical and the movie is visually beautiful but for me that isnt enough to justify adding stars i came for the story and to be entertained in this respect it failed for me i felt there were a few holes in the story and his abilities seemed inconsistentanother failure was in marrying the comedy with the serious at times i was watching a dramatic action film at other times a cheap comedy sketch it never quite pulls off either i think this was to please the younger audience since the jokes were both childish and predictableone aspect i loved was the ocean throwing out its garbage pollution was a theme throughout the movie and i loved this hopefully some fans will take note of the message being sentoverall i think kids teenagers and young adults will love this movie but those of us hoping to finally see an for grown ups will be disappointed,fantasy
had no expectations whatsoever coming in to this movie hadnt even seen a trailer so i was delightfully surprised to be completely entertained for most of the movie the underwater cgi was much better than i expected cinematography was gorgeous and hallelujah for a female lead capable of taking care of herself kicking a like the queen she is enjoyed most of the main character portrayals too momoa was charming and smoldering heard was gorgeous and acted her part very well maybe willem defoe was a bit of the odd man out but still did his job like a pro and everyone else was solid as well sure the dialogue was spotty in places and some of the scenes ludicrous but no worse than many if not most of the superhero movies dominating the screens lately but for the love of mike would someone please tell them to quit making these movies so lengthy although also gotta say that i was surprised how short it actually felt as opposed to the last marvel offering that i squirmed through most of jmo though lighten up dont expect oscar worthy material and enjoy the ride its great fun,fantasy
poor attempt at jokes over reaching his abilities and crap acting visual effects are the only pros,fantasy
one of the worst comic book films since batman and robin,fantasy
this felt like i was watching an extended slightly higher budget episode of power rangers only mamoa lends this movie any credibility at all bad just bad,fantasy
what the hell bad effects story ok we seen it before but expected it anyway could have been 70min film but had to have meaningless scenes dc truly is coming to an end sad,fantasy
a tedious to watch movie that doesnt deserve its hypeits all about cgi here it looks gorgeous bright colors fantastic design of atlantis subnauticaesque bioluminescence but it feels shallow there are a lot of underwater scenes but they never feel like underwater they feel like everything is floating in zerog nothing in the water no cavitation no resistance everything flies around in top speed like in a space opera nothing has weight or feels physical the fight scenes are well done but become repetitive quite fastthe actors do very well but are battling with a boring clich script the dialogue is wooden the story is riddled with clumsy exposition and pointless mcguffins the characters never come alive you never feel for them they never make any meaningful choice that is not obvious the characters are sad fillers for an idiots adaptation of the monomyth used as an excuse to show of cgi the villains are beyond onedimensionalthis makes the whole thing a waste of very good production quality for a forgettable boring move that feels like fastforwarding through a btier video game,fantasy
even the extreme hotness of jason momoa couldnt save the overblown cgi abomination that is weak story  weak acting  overreliance on cgi  boring i actually fell asleep at one point  no small feat in a such a loud flick i could go on and on but that would waste even more of my time on this poorly executed drone,fantasy
never a dull moment but james wan forgets to direct his actors jason momoa is playing himself playing aquman they wasted cringeworthy moments on such an amazing actor like willem dafoe amber heard was every badass redhead ever boring the whole black manta plot was unnecessarythe visuals vfx and choreography were epic but the movie dissappoints on every other level the script is thin and fails to deliver even an ounce of sinceritypermission to come aboardup here tears feel wow thats just cringe,fantasy
what a waste of great actors marvel have a knack for bringing humour action great visuals and good story lines into their movies why cant dc comics  just seem to churn out garbage every time watched it until i seen people riding seahorses  switched off and continued watching the punisher series  absolutely horrendous dc movies are the nintendo switch of the genre and marvel are xbox one x both good at what they do but marvel are for grown ups and dc for children ,fantasy
overall not that good not saying its terrible and its worth the watch just dont expect great things special effects fight and actions scenes are great story is weak and rushed acting not bad its more of a script issue i think sometimes trying to be funny when not necessary but give id say give it a go dont expect great things and you will probably enjoy it as an easy movie,fantasy
i dont think ive been anymore disappointed in a hero movie lame is the best word i can use to describe what i watched,fantasy
as usual 1010 reviews by new users and this is their only movie review ever lmao so all the good reviews are bought and paid for with that said this movie while slightly better than a lot of other dceu flicks its still 1 dimensional jason momoa is terrible and its just full of holes id recommend watching it once but donthave any expectations,fantasy
jason momoa makes a badass and amber heard is a great actress along with a host of other well known actors none of them could save this quickly put together movie that has no real development and awful dialoguei agree that the visuals were great the first fight scene w kidman was really well donei just found myself about a half hour in wondering if i should just give up on this one and leave but we stayed through the whole film and i walked out thinking theres 23hrs im never getting back,fantasy
this movie is basically thor ragnarok  black panther  dc it has elements from each of them overall dc did a good job i pity the other dc movies and the actorsactresses that did the previous dc movies,fantasy
 feels like one of those movies thats long overdue in its being released to the world its a wonder why this fella never got one theatrical release pre2018 because so many iconic characters out there are just busting to be featured in these kinds of movies feels like it could have been released in 2004 and still would have had a similar response at the box office its got water action photogenic people populating the world its set in and popmusic ranging from the 80s to now its got all the hallmarks of a blockbuster thats trying to cater to everyone it possibly can i guess this is something of a course correction for dc comics films is a step in the right direction in that its more confident in its direction than justice league or suicide squad were but its not the nearperfect moviecomicmythology synthesis wonder woman had going for it however a step in the right direction is better than a gigantic step backwards im eager to see where the rest of arthur currys story goes from hereheres hoping that the rest of dcs upcoming movies can have the same selfconfidence does in its story and bombastic action,fantasy
i had really high hopes for this movie im even writing my first review ever because it was so astonishingly bad that i felt inclined to let everyone know how bad it was the writing and acting were really bad and actually just cringey i keep trying to give dc chances buti think i just have to come to terms with the fact that they are just not good,fantasy
i love the way the story was told lots of action way more than i thought would be in it has always been that hero that seemed the most boring out of the justice league members but this was made with great cinematic visuals and a great performance by jason momoa this spin on is definitely worth the watch,fantasy
while it has a frequently cringeworthy script a staple of the mostly disappointing dc movie universe and a plot line that leaves much to be desired the playfulness and cinematic zest displayed in means its a popcorn munching joy to behold on the big screennow a world conquering box office heavyweight this james wan directed and jason momoa starring blockbuster had a lot riding on it after many a dc film had left a sour taste in the mouths of eager cinemagoers making it great to see that forgoes much of the solemn and tiresome filmmaking on display in the likes of suicide squad justice league and batman v supermanmuch of the success of this visual spectacle is down to the talents of wan who has become one of the industrys most reliable and consistent directors with this film yet another example of his ability to be able to craft the type of cinematic experience that audiences will lap up enmasseutilizing the fantastical underwater world at his disposal wan goes pedal to the floor in regards to letting his imagination run wild and its safe to say that is one of the most visually dazzling and eye pleasingly colorful films to appear in some time allowing it to overcome many of its narrative and dialogue shortcomingsproving once more that they cant match it with marvel in regards to providing the storytelling and screenwriting smarts to go along with the spectacle side of the equation there are numerous and quite glaring problems with the way in which deals with its tale of momoas arthur curry on a quest to stop patrick wilsons underwater king orm from waging war against the dry land dwelling humans but its not enough to derail the fun times to be had with this watery adventureled by its energetic and easy to like leading man has a blast going on an 80s like quest across the various ocean kingdoms all over the globe and in these simplistic yet creatively designed aspects wans film shines with it easily becoming the most proficiently made dc film outside of nolans holy batman trilogy even if some deaging cgi at the start of the film and some downright icky training flashbacks make you wish you had closed your eyes and ears for a short timealso found within the film are some fun supporting turns with the likes of wilson amber heard willem dafoe and dolph lundgren all having a good time with their respective roles while wan and his team take a leaf out of the guardians of the galaxy rulebook and embrace their bonkers universe and instill it with a hearty dose of zany humor selfies with bikies anyonefinal say a visual feast and a fun offering for those of any age may not be highbrow stuff but this is crowdpleasing filmmaking of a high level thanks to wans creative direction and a strong sense if playfulness that outweighs the frequent daftness found within3 12 octopus drummers out of 5,fantasy
lets face it most super hero movies are cheesy and consist of action sequences this no real exception but it is entertainingi know nothing about from the comics so i cannot say how true to the canon it is what i will say is its not a dark film like the rest of the dc moviesi have no idea what super powers are  some things just dont seem to hurt him and yet he desperately tries not to fall or get hit  which makes no sense since some kinetic impacts are truly devastating looking  but then he cant take a punch from a humanbut lets not poke holes in the plot just enjoy it for what it is  a popcorn movie with nicole kidman who still looks amazing and amber heard who would make most men want to be a merman with lots of action,fantasy
finally went to see this today and loved it visually this movie is stunning i loved all the amazing underwater scenes in atlantis the cast was amazing great story also just an all around great flick,fantasy
mindblown finally the movie we dc fans wanted its epic its fun and its definitely better than any marvel movie and its my fifth favorite movie after the dark knight trilogy and empire strikes back,fantasy
the plot is not as crisp as it could be but the creatures and visuals are very are enjoyable,fantasy
the movie is a spectacal the visuals and the underwater world that has been shown one can imagine that this is how atlantis would be if it does exists the world deep inside the ocean there are only a few movies in 2018 which i have enjoyed as much as it was probably one of the best solo hero movie i have ever seen i just want to say to everyone enjoy the movie as you should dont try to find flaws or you will probably not have as much fun as you should watching this movie,fantasy
first i love dcu but i go into each movie really giving it a chance this movie has a great idea but too much cgi and really bad and i mean bad stiff acting just never lets it take off they need to lay off the cgi develop a great story and let the actors do the rest instead they get mediocre actors do a so so story then expect the cgi to save the day i like the effort i like that they want to move the story along but its getting painful go see it just make sure you get the morning show its not worth 11 dollars,fantasy
could have been so much better they couldnt pick what kind of movie they wanted it to be and the writing was cheesy,fantasy
the plot is pretty straightforward nothing wrong with it and actually features a very strong and satisfying ending after over 2 hours of film characters play their role and are sufficiently developed unfortunately i cant speak a lot about the acting because i saw the translated version scenography is very good and stays true to the nature of the filmhowever as the title says camera work is one of the things that is absolute astonishing about this movie visuals in this film specially the one sorrounding atlantian culture are breathtaking and a delight to see fight scenes flow ridiculously smoothly but i do have to admit there are moments where they overdo it but i can count those with one hands fingers weakest points of the visuals are meras eyes and the water flow effect that zooms on certain parts of the screen momentarily it makes serious moments a bit ridiculousthe ancient atlantian history and folklore shown in the movie is really entertaining and grants a very entertaining trip through ancient atlantian landmarksoverall its a pretty well thoughtout and executed movie and its flaws like overly dramatic scenes and terrible use of music in come across as pretty meaningless in the bigger picture,fantasy
vfx is nice story is good dceus highest grossing movie,fantasy
i was initially hesitant about seeing since most of the other dc movies that have come out recently were just derivative generic rubbish with the exception of wonder woman however i decided to give it a go and must say i quite enjoyed it it has a guardians of the galaxy vibe in that its very colorful and over the top action sequences are extremely well done and quite a few scenes are just stunning in terms of lighting and effects the story is fairly basic but unpredictable enough compared to the standard superhero movie to be a bit more engaging some of the characters could have been fleshed out more but jason mamoa was a perfect casting choice and really steals the show the pacing is ok i was never bored but some scenes felt a bit rushed and others seemed to go on for a bit longer than was really necessary i found myself wanting a bit more humor and a little less campiness the costumes especially were a bit much for me but overall i found the film to be enjoyable and refreshing compared to the rest of the dc movies is essentially a big 80s cartoon brought to life with truly stunning cinematography and a strong cast definitely worth checking out in my opinion,fantasy
i was worried we were getting the same formula as wonder woman when i first saw the trailer but honestly its not a bad superhero movies not the best but as a standalone movie now that the movie universe is pretty much dead is a good film cgi underwater looked above average acting was great as it should be with this budget good story just nothing that quite stuck out or made it memorable if you absolutely love or theres not much playing in theaters then give it a shot but you might like it a little more on redbox 710 for me for being an good above average movie,fantasy
 is a visual delight the battle scenes are excellent the story despite being simple meets its objective the ost could have been better it is far below the ost show that dc has us used to in his films,fantasy
the originality of the character is super high expect doesnt have blond hair in this film lol otherwise all the characters looks almost alike with the comic the storyline is also great it is a pretty well done job to squeeze massive stories from the comic into a 2 hours film however i think it is better to read some comic first before watch this film it will make you have better understanding and felt the films originality from the comicim so glad that dc has finally on the right track on the film making i hope they keep their good work for long term always prefer dc comic than the marvelsplus i found quite interestingly that in this film for some fighting scenes i felt like im watching drangon balls character fighting scenes and doing their fatal blow or doing kong fu fighting and nicole kidman is so hot and wicked in the film her fighting scenes is awesome,fantasy
i do not want sound like im bashing the movie because i didnt expect much from a superhero movie theyre meant to be fun and i completely respect that is proof that studios want to be safe have fun and pump out something for the massesthe amount of green screen kept throwing me out of the experience not because it was used but because it was consistently noticeable the overall theme was to be aware of human pollution and how it affects parts of the world we can not seethe cliche witty dialogue was also expected but it was the amount of dramatic pauses and slow motions that were unbearablebreaking bread i will say that the choice to track the action versus cutting between shot was refreshing and there were certain visual shots that were great  a favorite being the trench dive,fantasy
this movie took too long to tell a simple story the plot is predictable there is no surprise or nothing to see here the visual effect is stunning at the beginning but after a while it gets old and boring  i wouldnt say it was a awful movie but its far from being great i dont know if dc is even capable of matching what marvel does dont believe the hype giving this movie a 10 is overrated to say the least ,fantasy
its just another superhero movie with bad cgi  underwater movementss look unrea  unlogical physics obvious plothowever its one of the bests from dc good to take your kid to watchthe art is also very beatyfull from the underwater cities to italy and beyond the scenary looks great,fantasy
i was rather disappointed by this movie before i went there i read criitcs stating how humerous and gorgeous this movie should be i liked the cast of jason momoa as very much he is perfect for this role but the movie starts rather boring because they need to tell the long story of the underwater peoples in the middle there is a shallow adventure episode and in the end a battle which makes you feel like watching a computer game which is sadly stateoftheart nowadaysa like marvel movies because of the funny dialogues and often deep characters and conflicts in the story i hoped for this but unfortunately this dc movie can not compete with it,fantasy
i really wanted to like this movie ill list the things i liked firstnicole kidman as a heroshe never plays characters like this and i liked her castingjason mamoa is cast well for this partvisuals are mostly very goodnow what i didnt likeamber heard is awful she has no dimension and no chemistry between her and momoa shes not believable as an action star her line delivery is so bad it makes you cringethe plotpredictable and rushed if youve seen any superhero movie youll know the plot within the first 10 minutesscript wow its bad they dont develop any character including momoa and rush every cliche in the book to try and make this work jokes fall flat everything just feels halfway done its disjointed and relies too heavily on battles that you arent even sure why they are really happening it was like we have to introduce this whole world in 25 hours so here is as thin as we can do itits way too long i was bored about halfway throughthe visuals although good dont give you enough detail to get invested and the underwater hair bothered mesometimes it floated sometimes it didnttoo many villains just pick one the brother or manta i think thats his name but honestly im not even surei really feel like they should have done the origin story first and only tell me how momoa was taught about his two worlds how did he decide to become this hero how does he meet dafoes character what does he do on a daily basis how does he find out about all these issues at sea that he needs to fixthen next movie is finding his mom and fighting his brotherthen next movie is fighting mantaim really giving this 3 stars for momoas abs other than that save your 10 and go watch the previews and youll know what happens,fantasy
the good jason mamoa nicole kidman and temuera morrison the cgi toothe bad the script the direction the music and most of all amber heard,fantasy
another great dc comic brought to the big screen way better than wonder woman any of them are better than wonder woman gal gadot simply isnt right for the part the whole storyline in was done perfectly and everything amazing acting and special effects and sound and everything a lot of movies make reference to poseidon who as legend has it is god of the seas yet there has been no movie based strictly about and around poseidon which i think would be very interesting i would like to see a movie like that one day,fantasy

after jl i was not that expectant but i blew out my breath and nodded at the end of the movie i liked thor ragnarok better than infinity war and i liked this one more than ww and jl dont know if it s about humor but i really enjoyed the movie the plot except kraken why guys you dont use the name just like as it is as kraken i have heard thousand versions of the name and sick of it it sounds a little disrespectful visuals costumes oh costume is awesome btw really loved it didnt like the end credits though manta is a meh enemy and i am not sure i want to see him in the next or jl movie he is the master of the ocean and manta pfsps dear cam guys amber heard is already astonishing you dont have to shoot the girl like shooting a blendax commercial head on the mid sunset on the back hair waving leave the lips ajar  pls dont,fantasy
dceu make a great movie like everything is going to find,fantasy
if you are into heroscifi movies you will like this one good story that moves well and lots of action only gripe is that it gets a little preachy,fantasy
by far the best dc movie to date  exeptionnal visuals  exellent performances by momoa and amber heard  looks like dc finally listened to the fans making for once a movie with the quality of their animation movies applause,fantasy
1 or 10 is just not helpful theyre just films not life or death enjoyable 7510,fantasy
everything was amazing in this movie from the story line the graphics the characters the actors and the directing this movie is 100 worth seeing more than once,fantasy
dont listen to the haters their brains are still not developed enough to judge a movie without opinions of certain bandwagoners influencing their hate has amazing character development visuals are better than promised and marvel please learn how to do fight scenes and soundtracks like dc,fantasy
this movie first of all was the greatest thing to happen to the dceu since the in my opinion awful 2017 justice league movie this movie is action packed and really a great story line i would really recommend it for anyone who likes to the movie theaters i give this movie a 910 there are some mistakes but that is barely noticeable due to the greatness of the rest of the movie,fantasy
the movie inpresses me visually the effects an cgi that is used is amazing just as any other new marvel movie at this point but the bad acting and plot actually made me look away from the movie because of pure embarrassment what a shame of such good visual effects i enjoyed every single fight although but then the mood is killed again when pitbulls awful version of the timeless classic africa by toto i was again embarrassed not much to spoil in this movie either because it simply contains every superhero cliche ever and not in a funny way such as in the deadpool movies of course the movie works and excites but not enough for me to get scared of the beloved and his deaththe movie also tries too make the audience laugh in some of the scenes which for me i felt falled through it felt so fake and scripted that i wondered who thought it was a good idea the only actor who made me laugh at one point of the movie was the himself jason momoa he handled the cheesy lines of the script okay and he made the movie easier too watch i felt ripped of after i left the cinema and it was not at all worth the money bad movie bad acting and boring and lazy writing but great visual effects,fantasy
i love this genre of films i wait to be taken away to these magical worlds auaman does that but it is not the film of the year i loved the cinematography and the colors definetly did not regret watching it but the story was not amazing,fantasy
sure you can nitpick if youd like but this movie is way enjoyable this is a movie that works for the whole family and as long as you can stand how surfacey it is youll enjoy it its simple in the best way a fun adventure like indiana jones or gooniesit has that cool king from game of thrones green goblin ivan drago an octopus that plays drums nite owl and amber herd whos pretty cool in it,fantasy
in a nutshell if youre looking for an entertaining blockbuster this is it the world of atlantis in particular was beautiful and i hope future films focus on this and expand a lot more on the people and sea creaturessurprises the acting was great from everyone and the storyline made sense some tropes of coursethe reason the film lost a star for me was that some of the writing was super lame i understand these hero films dont want to take themselves too seriously but the acting was so good and the story so engaging that some more earnest and sincere responses would have been appreciated instead of lines like what a dck i also didnt like that they made come across as a bit of a douche this is a guy who thought he lost his mum as a child and has seen some horrific stuff while saving peoples lives but comes across as some carefree surfer dude i hope the next film shows him exploring atlantis taking on his duties and really seeing what it means to be king  perhaps also losing either his mother or wife in some tragic way so that he can grow as a person and change his characters personality in a legitimate way so that the writing can improve as well as it stands is like a watereddown lessfunny version of thor and needs his own unique personalityminor issues which can be fixed in subsequent films ill definitely be watching sequels910,fantasy
interesting ways of using angles slow mo and fast forward styles in action sequences is one of those few movies where you can feel exhilarated nearly throughout the movie especially for recent moviesthe lightheartedness between tense scenes are also well done to control the pace at which the storyline goesone slight disadvantage about this movie though is that some parts are quite cliched and thus predictable,fantasy
watched this over the weekend with the kids another amazing movie from a rather lowprofile superhero have not heard of till the movie was out good cgi and storyline more entertaining for older kids and adults,fantasy
the cgi is outstanding and there is an actual story the superhero movies of late all seem to bleed together to mefun to look at but no story to speak of i have never been a big fan of but this movie was a lot of fun really enjoyed myself could have been a tad shorter in run time though looking forward to the next installment,fantasy
epic fun amber heard and nicole kidman rocknice that dc heroines are holding their ownjason momoa nails the role ofa visual feast fingers crossed for a wwmera crossover movie cant wait for 2,fantasy
the origin story was interesting if predictable the acting was uneven jason momoa was the rough and tumble guy we expect from him amber heards acting was really poor even her line delivery was very amateurish nicole kidman was perfect in her role the one remarkable feature of the movie is the beautiful underwater cgi which was magical if overly fond of jellyfish i give this film a 7 good but unremarkable out of 10 scifi action adventure,fantasy
ive been so negative about having a solo movie of because i thought it would be hard to accomplish the movie is so amazing that it made me believe that there are people in the ocean storytelling was done in a nice pace even with some cringy dialogues that are forgivableatlantis looked breathtaking and the underwater scenes could not have been done any better being able to make a world that we have never seen although its just under our nose is brilliant and really makes us believe that atlantis might existall hail king arthur,fantasy
aqua man was an amazing visual and cinematic experience the acting was reasonable but corny which i never have a problem with aqua man is probably my favorite dc movie right now its different and not a movie anyone would have really expected the budget on this movie was used perfectly on the cgi the way the actors portrayed their characters was again reasonable the only tiny problem i have with the movie how ever is nicole kidmans character she in my opinion drags the story that is all i have to say,fantasy
expected to see more of his mothers story and what happened once she returned to atlantis also more of relationship with creatures of the sea so powerful so many explosions and battles felt boring gratuitous,fantasy
undoubtedly is the one best comic film and best dceu film till now nice cinematography good acting combined with good cgi but as a mcu fan just want to say that dont compare with it mcu is good in its own realm so comparing with other universe is waste of time only i hope dceu released it earlier than justice league then we can understand better this character in jl overall a good film to watch you will not feel bore while watching this,fantasy
dc finally went right direction jason momoa was right decision for,fantasy
i am verry pleased for those who had beed choose to watch it,fantasy
for me marvel set high bar and dc can touch the bar yet still it is the second movies i like from dc after wonder woman,fantasy
a good movie slowly dc and warner bros are getting on the right track good going,fantasy
it was visually stunning no doubt about it imax is the way to go action was not in short supply it was very entertaining the story line was not hard to follow and made sense in order for the characters to achieve their ultimate goalthe issue i have is with the casting i enjoy mamoa in certain roles but i felt like too much of him came through in the characteri felt the same about him in jlpatrick wilson stole every scene he was in played orm brilliantly and interestingly enough physically looked like he shouldve been cast as all the other actors fit their roles perfectly but when it ended i was left feeling like something was missing it was good but not greatclose second to man of steel for dc,fantasy
 is the latest entry in the dceu movie list i was excited but nit extremely enthused about this film given the track record with the dceu however i can now say i love this movie this is now my favorite dceu movie even over wonder woman and is now my second favorite film of 2018 behind infinity war this film hit every mark its not an overly deep or complex film but it isnt trying to be it set out to be an entertaining and outlandish comic book film and it goes full throttle with it its essentially your average mcu movie though i enjoyed this more than many of the recent marvel filmsthe story is relatively simple arthur curry is a half breed his mother was a queen of atlantis and his father is human now his mother has disappeared and his brother ormocean master the king of atlantis is threatening to invade the surface now it is up to him to challenge his brother to become the rightful kingthe best word to describe is spectacle this film is a great visual and action spectacle this is easily the best most colorful looking dceu movie to date the action is a thrill and it never sops going the film is almost two and a half hours but it doesnt feel it like some of the other movies do there were a couple pacing issues but overall i was never bored watching this filmunlike batman superman or even wonder woman i was never that big of a fan of growing up it wasnt until i read geoff johns brilliant comic run in the dc new 52 that i really appreciated the character throne of atlantis especially is one of my favorite stories in comics this movie felt very much like an adaptation of that run which isnt much of a surprise as geoff johns was also a writer for this film and a producerthe cast is spectacular too you have a cast of jason momoa patrick wilson willem dafoe dolph lundgren and nicole kidman jason momoa especially did a fantastic job here he was badass funny charming and even charismatic i was never sold on his version of his performance in justice league didnt do much for me but he killed it in this film seeing him the traditional costume near the end was great and it felt earned here unlike in man of steeloverall is a great superhero film and just a fun movie all the way through i cant really think of much wrong with this again it isnt a masterpiece like the dark knight but not every film needs to be like that it set out to be an entertaining ride with just enough heart to it and it works even if you dont think is cool give this a watch anyway you might change your mind,fantasy
 and spiderman one is visually stunning and the other one is touching,fantasy
 is a war movie without strategy or intrigue a quest story with as little motivation as a dungeons  dragons game played by 8year olds a love story with no chemistry and a ripoff of at least 20 other movies from the indiana jones films to the princess bridethere is no character development sufficiently complex to interest anyone old enough to know what character development is there are holes in the plot so large that the movie repeatedly disappears into them where do the oceans denizens dispose of their waste products and pollution the atlanteans are technologically sophisticated but they are a culture that practices superstition and worships war what is the source of production and the power behind the production of all that tech what affect is the ocean dwelling civilization having on ocean temperatures and how come the land dwellers dont know about all those creatures the acting is brutally melodramatic and all the big plot twists can be foreseen ten minutes into the filmbut it is a fine looking movie with lots of dazzling cgi effectsif youve got a 4k tv i suggest you wait until releases on home video then check out a copy from your local library,fantasy
the girl with the red hair is super pretty 1010 movie,fantasy
 was simply visually stunning it was an epic sea adventure it was filled with joy action and perfect message best dceu movie alongside wonder woman,fantasy
the movies was very nice graphic was epic james wan did an excellent job jason is the best,fantasy
i love the movie and it was absolutely amazing easily the best movie ive ever seen but now everything feels weird im almost sad that im not and almost depressed that im not jason momoa or that im not in the world of aqua man why do i feel this way i feel super sad after watching it even though it was a great movie,fantasy
great movie amazing shotsgreat script great visual effects,fantasy
entertaining not more not less surely a lot of animations visually appealing scenes and around 100 minutes of entertainment that are ok the movie never gets boring but giving it 1010 is simply not justified no depth shallow main characters but thats what youd expect from that kind of movie so it fulfilled expectations,fantasy
well aside the mainstream jokes and the bad songs  this movie was great to watch the action was very good and the plot was nice also orm stopp screaming hahaha,fantasy
a lot to like in this movie some holes but not as many as previous dc movies black manta was great visuals were very good,fantasy
im pretty much over super hero movies anyway and this one is no exception for the type of thing it is its done well enough but like most of them dc marvel or otherwise theyve just become rather ho hum and the original comic book fun is long gone jason momoa is good nicole kidman is even better the cgi is just overblown and the underwater scenes just dont seem to cut it not enough bubbles or something as far as comic book heroes are concerned i think the old batman and superman tv series are the only ones who really got it right,fantasy
well like every one i was expecting a great addition to the dc stable sadly it doesnt live up to the hypewhile this is a good popcorn superhero movie and jason momoa is excellent as i wondered what nicole kidman was thinking when she signed on other than a nice pay cheque the black manta subplot was completely wasted  would have been better to use in the sequelthe visual effects while spectacular in places looked a bit more of the same think the abyss thor  not as original as i would have expectedoverall it was good but not great certainly better than other entries in the dc universe so far,fantasy
amazing visuals and great directing made this a fun movie a few times i found myself taken back by the action and camera angles they used cant wait to see what they can do next with the dc extended universe,fantasy
a fait du bien de voir autres mchants que des extraterrestres,fantasy
i dont know why people are raving about this movie dont get me wrong its far from bad and it certainly isnt great by any meansthe biggest problem i have with this film is black mantis is completely and unnecessary forced into the plot most of the major plot holes are around this characterfirst off his revenge plot is weak could have been so much better he and his dad murder innocent people for a living yet the story tries to make you care about his thirst for revenge the worst though is how he is able to somehow completely i mean completely reengineer reshape and dramatically enhance technology that the atlantians gave him and called it state of the art also he must have done it near a black hole because the rest of the story progresses about a couple of days while he does it oh and he learns how to use it to fight and fly as well absurd and unnecessaryother things that bothered me werethat the comedy was forced though not bad tries to stop the war by attacking and killing thousands of innocent the army that is defending their home and dont want warand why the king needs to go to war with the last kingdom before atracking the surface is beyond me its not like he follows the rules anywayfinally humans are in disbelief about a possible atlantis yet they live in a universe where superman wonderwoman and batman are front page news stupid,fantasy
also i expected so much worse lol spose it could have been worse impossible to be worse than batman and robin,fantasy
 is the second dcu movie to hit it out of the park though i concede that wonder woman still had the stronger storythe whole thing looks great the film goes full ballstothe wall in creating the entire fictional kingdom of atlantis and several other underwater kingdoms and locations the whole thing has an 80s fantasyscifiadventure feel to it a lot of work went into the details on this the movie includes one dress and one visual sequence youll know it when you see it that really catch your eye the fight sequences including a fullscale battle really nail it i also applaud the movies effort to bring black manta and ocean masters outfits to life without majorly reworking the designsthe script does a fair job of balancing drama and comedy jason momoa remains utterly cool and charming as the lead he and amber heard as mera have good chemistry credit should also be given to patrick wilson as ocean master he is a complete jerk in this but you always understand where he is coming from and why he feels justified in what he is doingthe movie does try to cram in a little too much we get backstory atlantis surprisingly indepth backstory all three of best known villains and practically every major supporting character except aqualad you do tend to get thrown from one scene to the next and i wished mera and had a little more time to build their relationship still i do give director james wan credit for trying to get in as much of the mythos as possible there is a lot of thought put into this world the script is busy but it isnt confusing or particularly jerky you are given all the info needed and the flashbacks about origin are really well integrated and dont overstay their welcome,fantasy
this movie was really enjoyable among my favorite super hero movies ever,fantasy
it is a good with a good and a lot of action not like others movies dc but are some thinghs weird anyway its a good movie,fantasy
sure has its flaws being full of cliches and predictability what else do you expect with a story about a man who is caught between worlds and has to face his family in order to unite the worlds lolother than that is a brilliant superhero movie playing in a newly created world which is a wonderful combination of lord of the rings abyss and avatar and perfectly matching sound effects despite the story being predictable and being loaded with effects never becomes superficial it offers enough background and soft moments to make almost every character even those with little screen time interesting believable and likable on the other hand it offers enough action and speed not suffering under special effects to be continuously entertainingis it a perfect movie no is it the best superhero movie no but its a movie that never feels rushed contains all necessary elements including some well timed comedy and is perfectly balanced this makes this movie incredibly entertaining and the first movie that can actually compete with marvel and is hopefully a promise of more to come having said that the only real bad parts were amber heard who is little more than eye candy and may remind you of pamela anderson in barb wire dolph lundgren may thank his lucky stars for being in this flick but should focus on expendable sequels is an epic and fun visual spectacle thanks to james wan a director who knows how to handle this and various other genres,fantasy
wow i enjoyed this movie a lot i went to with no expatation and i got blown away okay its not a oscar movie but i dont give a ck the underwater war i loved it i want more,fantasy
took away a star just for ruining africa by toto with pitbulls cover it was awful,fantasy

personally gave this 910 stars as i loved jasons take on  the visual effects of the movie sure there were a few scenes that were a little cheesy but that didnt bother me compared to the action of the movie jasons acting  visual effects as i mentioned amber heards character was a good match to  thought patrick wilson pulled off being the villain i couldnt think of another actor who could have played any better than jason momoa he definitely pulls off the fight scenes  shows the right amount of emotion during his talking parts of course he has the perfect body to wear those tight suits the visual effects created beautiful colors of the sea life  makeup people did great job doing their thing on the actors who werent human overall dc is back  i cant wait to see an sequel so people you need to stay when the credits start to roll as halfway thru them there is a postcredit scene which sets the tone for a sequel,fantasy
take a trident get superhero suit for freethe story is not well curated but the picture of good not bad to watch it for leisure,fantasy
really good action and story line dialogue is embarrassing and makes it hard not to laugh,fantasy
this is the most thrilling comic book movie ever i applaud a james wan on the absolutely captivating fluidmotion action sequencesi enjoyed every bit of it,fantasy
absolutely loved the actors the scenery the costumes the music the storythe only problem i had with it hence minus a star was that one scene that reminded me exactly of both hiccups reunion with his longlost mother in a hardtogettoplace from how to train your dragon 2 and dr pimms reunion with his longlost wife in a hardtogettoplace in antman and the wasp anyone whos seen any combination of the three knows exactly what im talking about,fantasy
i rarely taken in a film in imax but i had an inkling this was going to be visually striking so worth the extra cost the colors and textures were amazing and no one would argue against watching jason mamoa up close and large and in charge,fantasy
comicbook hero arthur curry lives by his own rules content to help the innocent and drink beer when his halfbrother oram threatens the world with destruction arthur must confront an ancient legacy in order to become king of atlantis and earn the mantle of a wild ride thats sure to impress director james wans ability to balance action story and colorful characters delivers a solid tale about facing your destiny,fantasy
this movie is so ridiculous and dumb that it actual makes for a fun time however contains three major flaws1 this movie falls victim to the common virus in every day movies and that is the over use of cgi this film is layered with cgi to the point were every single scene in this movie contains large amounts cgi the filims over the top graphics makes everything look fake making it hard for you connect to the characters or story the battle scenes are just cgi monsters crashing into each other and turning the intense scenes into something out of a michael bay film ever fight or intense scene i was laughing my head off because of the fake and chessy cgi2 in the comics is a ridiculous character and i respect how hard they tried to make this movie not as dumb and corny however the movies plot is unoriginal and the script is laughable the plot of aruther try to stop the war of two different worlds by claiming his right to the throne has been seen many times in movies most recently black panther which came out earlier in 2018 they tried their best to make a good script but everything they said was laughable and corny for example their is a scene in which the villain is confronting a cgi crab the crab says that he will not call the villain your highness the villain responds that he does not want to be called highness but oceanmaster this is supposed to be an intense and chilling speech but i found my self once again laughing out loud3 is play very well as jason momoa he brings a charming and charismatic personality that is fun and enjoyable to watch however all the characters are god like people with super human strength and stamina while this provides the characters with awesome moments it also adds very little stakes is constantly stabed shot or falling from great heights every time he comes out without a scratch providing little to no stakes because the characters are nearly invincibleeven though has many flaws it still is a fun and enjoyable movie,fantasy
i am not a dc guy so i went into with a bit of dubiousness we boomers chose sides in the dcmarvel rivalry decades ago and you either were fer or agin one or the other with a fanaticism bordering on cold war intensity there were some outliers who claimed to like both equally but they were viewed with suspicion like pacifists who insisted the commies werent all that bad adding to the dubiousness its a blond spandexfish scale armorwearing guy who rides a seahorse and pals around with spandex wearing aquakid a la batman and robin evoking the same uncomfortableness regarding their relationship and he talked to fish fishnot that i felt any particular animus to the character i watched the cartoonback in the 60s with some satisfaction thrilled that tv had finally come to its senses and was showing comic book characters even if it was dc cartoon remained in his wheelhouse the ocean and did ocean things so was not to be taken seriously this movie though is deadly serious done up in the person of badass cool guy jason momoa who did quite a good job in justice leaguewhich i likedyes i know that places me in a very small minority and lends suspicion that i might be one of those aforementioned pacifists going soft on the reds but it was pretty good as was batman vs superman see i can be persuaded might turn out to be this years dark knightits notinstead it turned into a mashup of lord of the rings excalibur starship troopers the cthullu mythos gladiator the little mermaid the hunt for red october the avengers oh just about every movie of the last twenty years or so i swear some computer geeks got together and said man we gotta make some money so lets cgi every trope from every movie because you know people like that stuff theres even a skywalker finding his mother i swearthe first ten minutes or so was great nicole kidmanor her stunt double kicked royal butt and butt royally depending with whom she crossed tridents gotta say all the movie fights were stellar but danger will robinson a copy of dunwich horror lies on a tabletop now why would that be cause you know if you show a gun in the first act you gotta use it in the third and yep cthulhu shows up later along with hisher fish monsters wtf did one of the computer geeks note arkham asylum in dark knight and figured there was a lovecraft connectioni blame public educationminutes later the scene that killed the movie a line of armoured seahorses facing off a line of armoured sharks with lasers and all roaring at each other i laughed out loud then asked is this a jokeno apparently not even when the timpani playing octopus was beating out the planet hulk combat rhythm in the arena when the green goblin cgifloated around pretending hes still loyal to the master race and aryan god boy ocean master screams like howard dean on the campaign trail youre supposed to regard all this as serious and intenseits like springtime for hitleri can go on and on and on but ill just hit the lowlights frinstance the entire russian navy knows exists even speaks russian fluently everyone on the east coast knows exists they party with the dude yet the news media pishposhes the idea of atlanteans among usmust be cnnthere is an eeeevil villain who simply cant get over that didnt save eeevil villains dad from a watery death dude your dad was a pirate sort of goes with the territory so lighten up but noooo evil villain constructs an eeevil costume replete with a dirigible helmet that fires plasma youd think a guy who knows hes going to be maneuvering around submarine interiors would select something a little less unwieldy but its dc simple physics never bothered them like the batcopterand for all their high tech the atlanteans are not the brightest aryan god boy knew for decades where his hated halfbrother lived and waits of course until aquaboy is full on badass before deciding to take him on for that matter the plasma firing laser shark atlanteans have had a beef with the surface world for nighon millenia but of course wait until weve got badass on our side before making a move no wonder the gods drowned thembut nicole kidman showing up in a lobster suitthats it donemake mine marvel,fantasy
this film is so predictable its boring nothing happens besides explosions some good graphics though,fantasy
exactly what you would expect from a good super hero movie action humour and just enjoyable to watch  cgi is phenomenal and although it is long i found myself drawn into the movie the whole time one of dcs best,fantasy
cinematography james wan does well to produce very good visuals the action scenes are well depicted in cgi infested sceneries just like in his previous works calm scenes are often interrupted with loud noise that introduces action too often that it appears repetitiveplot in summary its a good adventure that takes enough of its time to deliver an enjoyable story however more could have been done on the character development with the time that was put incharacterscasts we have a hero that offers very little apart from his seductive charm he is very quickly on top of things even as his challenges become increasingly difficult nicole kidman and amber heard were charmingthe villains are somewhat deplorable we have an ever grumpy black manta whose role is unnecessary working with a power hungry warmongering king orm whose tender looks simply do not match his malevolence,fantasy
this movie blew me out of the water no pun intended after justice league i was seriously concerned about the future of the dceu especially jason momoas portrayal of the aquatic hero is amazing so it wouldve been a shame had the movie been badthankfully my concerns were put to rest this movie was stunning enjoyable and exciting i was glued to the screen the entire time i didnt want to blink in case i missed something james wan created a masterpiece every actor and actress killed it i wouldve given this movie a 10 but i thought the plot was a little to predictablesee this movie now,fantasy
distinctive fun and visually stunning this is the best dc superhero movie yet to enjoy it just embrace it for what it is a story about a halfhuman guy who swims about 500 mph and breathes water good performance some good laughs and a compelling story for a comic book movie despite a soso script as a justice league fan since the 60s this was a delight truly enjoyable popcorn flick,fantasy
this movie exceeded all my expectations the visuals are simply stunning wan created a unique world were everything seems possible jason momoa had quite a lot of fun playing and it is contagious,fantasy
now this is my first review  this movie was amazing the action effects choice of villians humor and romance was outstanding now i know a lot of reviewers or critics are going to say too much cgi but what do you expect most of the movie was underwater as a comic fan i would highly recommend this movie,fantasy
wow if you are the type of person that wants comic book accurate then see thisprosvisuals are some of the best ive seen in any movie maybe everacting is spot onvery comic book accuratenever should you feel boredvillans are amazingconsslight bit cheesy occasionallyits a bit of an origin story and with the 1000 marvel origin stories some might feel like this is the exact same but it being an origin story is really good for the future of the franchise somy thoughts on momoa and its plot is an incredible film with awesome visuals and really good acting the plot is good but it felt like a origin story and i feel like ive seen a 1000 of these and i just want more which isnt bad cause a sequel is very likely and i definitely want one too i really enjoyed jason monoas performance in this film im glad they didnt cast a blond type muscular dude that was kinda good at acting what the og character looked like and it felt like the thor of the sea movie instead jasons look and his awesome acting skills make just him as a character way better than the og comic books of the way looked one the other hand they did the og looking suit on jason and it look awesome this was not only comic book accurate but i was just overall a good looks for the movies tonevillainsoceanmaster was a great villain and what was nice about him was that he had a good motive for his actions which is very unfamiliar for a dceu movie often dceu movies villains have stupid motives and so they always arent great this is the opposite for oceanmaster and lets not forget his awesome helmet but black manta is the mvp of this movie him as a villain was awesome i just want more of him in the sick suit the helmet was crazy comic book accuratevisualsthey are crazy goodthats all i have to saymerawow shes awesome super good acting by amber heard her powers are crazy cool and there is one scene that shows off her powers in the coolest way and i loved itreason of rating910 because of the slightly cheesy moments that made me the slightest uncomfortable but its really not that badmy biggest recommendation is to see it in 3d im not a big fan of 3d but it made the movie 100 times betteroverallbest dceu movie of all timethis makes me look forward to the future of the dceu i hoe they dont let me down,fantasy
the people behind this film knew exactly what kind of film they wanted to make and you know what it worked for the most part is a ton of fun and jason momoa has a blast playing the titular character there are definitely some cheesy moments and lines but james wan seemed to be going for that goofy fun vibe with the film it was a nice change of pace for this film to not be saddled by universebuilding and just focus on telling the main heros story if wb keeps making dc films in this vein sign me up for more,fantasy
 is the brunt of every joke the character has been constantly ridiculed for being really lame oh wow he can talk to fish however 2018 is amazingly surprisingly thrilling the story is engaging and the characters are fun and interesting the visuals were also stimulating what with all of the different fish the drumming octopus and the beautiful city of atlantis just to name a fewthe jokes often seemed a little out of place however which throws off the viewer slightly jason moamoa does action and drama much better than he does comedyall in all this was a surprising movie the acting was good the story was originalish and complimented the characters nicely and the visuals were beautiful 710 only because i cant bring myself to give anything higher,fantasy
must watch  the best movie from the dc universe,fantasy
after wonderwomen the best dc moviegreat cgi and i believe not a bad plot for a superhero flick,fantasy
interesting story and the special effects are outstanding great cast also the looks like his for real  brilliant christmas entertainment,fantasy
after listening to all the positive reviews about this movie decided to catch it in the theatres since i was a lil skeptical about seeing another dceu movie after their previous disappointments i crossed my fingers when it started and also had faith in james wan but to my utter surprise i was disappointed againthe movie didnt have a mature script was the biggest drawbackcostume design was horrible of the supporting castfelt like a melodramatic bollywood movie at the end when all family members meet up at the end mom is still alive all this time and is isolated from the world and her son for last few decades emotions are good but dceu people are making it melodramatic most obvious was martha scene from bvs but they should come up with a different take to represent it in the story telling so that it doesnt falter the scriptthe lead guy playing the was the best thing about the movie cinematography was great and action scenes were coordinated properlyone time watch definitely,fantasy
 is so glorious i got literal chills every second of it jason mamoa is too good as arthur curry amber heard is so amazing and perfect as mera black manta stole the entire movie for me for being the most dopest character ever and ocean master is one of the best dc villain since general zod from man of steel watching in 4dx is the perfect movie to watch if you love to get sprayedsplashed with water overall i have made my conclusion for making this movie as best of the year,fantasy
the first dc film ive truly enjoyed since the dark knight series i loved the campy feel of some of the lines because any comic book fan knows a hero has some cheesyness to him it has non stop action great cgi and they did a fair job of revealing black manta though he wasnt the main villain its a great take on though they definitely have room to grow with the acting not perfect by any means but it was so fun to watch that i couldnt help but talk about it all night with my wife during the drive home will definitely buy when it comes out the quest for the trident was drawn out and the villain ended up being a hair too weakly contrasted for my taste still go see the movie,fantasy
i loved the movie adventure war love perfect endinga tremendous way to launch of the super heros by dcit was not a formality it was a perfect whole of a moviedone well dc guys ,fantasy
this movie was fantastic its been awhile since ive watched something that kept me entertained and wanting more the special effects and acting were superb and the story line was fun to follow along with highly recommend for a fun action film,fantasy
more bearable than mary poppins for kids of all ages,fantasy
the visuals in the movie are stunning the acting is good the story is good just some scenes could of been extended and some could of been shorter but overall a decent film,fantasy
this movie was a the best dceu film to date i loved wonder woman but this film narrowly beats it out it has an excellent story compelling characters and picturesque effects best of all its reinvigorated my hope in the dceu,fantasy
its a nice movie and something different from what we see normally nowadays its absolutely different and apart from the very long duration of the movie the content is great and graphics and sound effects are perfect  something that takes your mind and attention away for more than 2 hours  well done and it was superb experience,fantasy
this movie was visually stunning the action kept me glued to the imax screen i was in a complete trance watching the man i loved as khal drogo play the hell out of the role of this is by far the best recent dc movie thats been made i would even say this was better than a lot of the marvel movies ive seen lately thank you for finally making a dc movie thats just completely bad ass,fantasy
thought it was awesome story outside of black manta and the music score im black so i dont know if the over all origin of black manta was forced for sake of the comics 20 years ago or if he was thrown in at last minute for this movies sake but regardless it didnt fit in at all the animated dc movie vs wonder woman and otter versions of black manta have been better in my opinionthe score was garbage im one of those ppl who will literally go out and buy music based on the movie i at no time enjoyed any of the music classical type was fineall that being said it was awesome half bro was nicely cast the red heads father was great jason mamoa awesome great movie which seasoned with mythologyother than black guy and music great movie,fantasy
slowly the dc cinematic universe dccu is building its own world to match the colossus built by the mcu the next justice legend to get his own origins story is but quite when this origins story is set is massively unclear apart from a line of throw away dialogue however a quick search online informs me that events in take place after the events of justice league but it would be difficult to tell because events of justice league seemed to have very little bearinganyway the underwater realm of atlantis is being pushed to its limits by the surface worlds endless polluting of earths oceans this leads to a political discourse where atlantians decide whether to launch an assault on the surface world when the surface world debatable attacks both omocean master patrick wilson and nereus doplh lundgren the tribes of xebel and om join forces to destroy the surface worldthe only man who can stop them is arthur curry half man half atlantian who harbors a strong resentment towards atlantis for the execution of his mother as punishment falling in love and having a child with a human the only way for arthur to stop oms destruction of the surface world is to find the trident of atlan which is will give command over all ocean lifesuch is the legendary and mythological status of these superhero characters in their own universes it is not perhaps surprising that the story is is inspired by some of the most famous mythological tales in literature the most notable being the legend of king arthur the two even share names where king arthur is the only one who can pull the sword of excalibur from the rock much like how only arthur curry can wield the trident of atlanother inspirations include jason and the argonauts as our heroes face deadly monsters in their quest to retrieve the legendary item  be it the golden fleece or the trident of atlan its here that fault in the movie can be found as the various epic set pieces dont feel tired together by a strong script which in fact is as weak as soggy paper it feels too unconnected as the movie bounds to from epic set piece to epic set piece with the only breaks from the action used as exposition so that we can keep up with everything going on even if some of it was painfully obviousthe scripts jumpy narrative makes the film the bloated mess that it is however helping us through it is director james wan whose experience at helming massive franchises has been of great benefit to him working with a massive 200000000 budget wan has helped create some stunning underworld citadels that retain an element of awe even in his gci dominated movie universejason momoa less said his teenage counterpart the better is charming and engaging enough in the lead role but much of the actors performances are lost in the tidal wave of gci which whilst impressive just leads the actors and some great ones too to be swallowed up by the oceans of gci with nothing to anchor the film with a strong identity it just gets cast adrift in the vast ocean of superhero movies,fantasy
literally one of the best standalone comic book based movie ever madei had a doubt over james wan directing this movie at first ohh boy i was soooo wronghe definitely nailed it and made a huge impact over dceu first of all bow down to the people who made the action scenes under water and on surface world cinematography visuals are in top notch for 2 hours 23 minutes it was never a boring movieand mera ohhh she nailed the audience personally a great movie to watch more than once music of it gives goosebumps kudos to zack snyder to select jason mamoa for cast as in bvs,fantasy
i just reached home from the cinema hall o man i am telling ya you will enjoy every single second and its worth every penny,fantasy
good movie effects really goodeasy to learn the character even for those who didnt know him before,fantasy
we saw todayi give it 610 per the following  it was about 90 3d and fx my movie review criteriashould have a story that i can relate strongly to  i personally like actionadventure and heroes  be they human heroes or super heroes should cause me to relate personally to the charactersshould be visceral  emotionally stirring  powerful  gut wrenchinga good individual liberty philosophy is important to me as an objectivist admittedly thats in short supply these days as the school kids have been educationally crippled by socialist indoctrination since the 60s  producing the likes of ocasiocortez  and have grown the government to a point that now threatens our societys very existence and libertyif its a 3d movie thats mostly fx were all getting jaded to that and its getting boring without the above,fantasy
i expected to be entertained i did not expect to cry at a movie about talking fish people three timeswilliam dafoe and jason mamoa turn into waterbenders on land can we get james wan to direct a good avatar the last airbender moviefantastic,fantasy
this movie was absolutely awesome heck james wannever heard of him until now but im impressed the movie industry should seriously support himive not seen a superhero movie this good in years i watched bumble bee after but despite the hype the was still more gripping than the bumble bee moviejason momoa has come quite a long way from stargate atlantis hehehe he really pulled it off with this movie nicole kidman and amber heard as pretty as everwell done everyone for making such a great moviethe last time i saw a movie this gripping was probably gladiator or speedthanks for making the end of 2018 a year to remembercompliments of the season to everyone,fantasy
under water world was great acting was fine all the best jokes were in trailers rest of it was cringe movie was a drag at times but my main problem is that they misused black manta either use him properly or dont have him in the movie because we spent alot of time in the beginning to see black mantas story to only have a half arsed endbut his suit was awesome  people are saying that didnt focus on setting up sequels or anything all the scenes with black manta were shit and a setup movie could have been great if you cut black manta out make ocean masters intentions true to his cause the only way to survive is to finish surface dwellers instead of using the fuing inside job villian againbest fight sequence was the first fight in the light house it was the best directed sequence of the movie along with trench dive scenesound track was awfuland dont say is cool now geoff jhones had already done that,fantasy
just like rdj for iron man role jason mamoa is the aqua man thoroughly enjoyed the movie i think this might save th dceu from bankruptcy,fantasy
amazing movie and and wonderful story line and amazing cinematography and good action sequences and great casting and good acting by every characters overall movie is multiple times watchable and totally entertaining  dc blast on theaters,fantasy
acting was so good action was so good pacing was good felt joy the whole movie would see again,fantasy
the underwater scenes were spectacular momoa made the best though i thought momoa could have been giving better lines the movie over all was a superb action movie i feel the sequel will be even better,fantasy
its a must watch movie everyone is superb full of adventure full of animation,fantasy
some fighting scenes were truly amazing the great imagery and choreography made you feel like you were in some fights yourself however a lot of other scenes were the opposite the first few scenes always ended in some sort of explosion or chaos and it to me was pretty tiring and it was just so clear that they didnt rly dare to just end a scene ordinarily apart from that the input of music was in some scenes almost laughable to me i say that as a film student but i guess it was nothing youd think of that much if you dont focus on how they edited it all i all so think the start was way to hard edited maybe that was the point or maybe its cause they spent a lot of time editing it down as dc seems to have to do to all of their movies nowadays either way they should have just added some environmental shots and just shown where exactly we were at rather than just jumping into a sceneoverall it was a good movie especially considering the previous ones in the dceu but neither cinematically nor story wise was it anything amazing good movie though and you should watch it ,fantasy
james wans directing yaybeall and mcgoldricks writing nayi dont believe its materially doable for me to scheme into words how carelessly ludicrous is i cant declare if i positively cherished the campiness and nuttiness of this movie or if i positively despised it warner bros have blown their 200milliondollar budget on something ferociously miraculous but also something terribly disposablein simple terms was acutely runofthemill for me because all though wans supervision of the action yes to those onetake shots and furthermore the numerous of filmmakers tackling of the graphics flowed lavishly the writing and dialogue nonetheless ignominiously sinks to the bottomground soooo i suppose ill meet in the middle with this encapsulation and proclaim that this lunacy of a productionthat isis all in all mediocre is testosterone fueled mania suffocated with oceans of shirtless men shrieking their heads off while mounting gigantic fishes if thats what you like in your movies i recommend trekking alongside this motion picture but if youre seeking out a superhero flick with sagacity and dandy quality turn the other way ill grant it this though its rigorously an improvement from justice leauge and suicide squad and hey ill even tally extra points for the halo jumpsuits and the hardcore drumming octopus verdict c,fantasy
great plot and the best cgi in a movie so far makes you feel like youre actually underwater,fantasy
 5 out of 5 stars is an awesome bada superhero film that delivers on an epic adventure scale with action sequences visual effects and a great story i will consider this to be the best dc movie beating out wonder woman the character seems like a cheesy character to even be adapted onto the big screen with jason momoa performance as the character he makes the character bada and even when he achieves his golden outfitthe plot is a great adventure story it was not rushed nor overstuffed with sub plots it follows atlanna nicole kidman the queen of atlantis being rescued by a lighthouse keeper thomas temuera morrison they both fall in love with each other and have a son named arthur jason momoa who will soon become as decades fly by is found by mera amber heard who informs him that his step brother orm patrick wilson is trying to wage war against the surface people and he is trying to unite the seven kingdoms underwater to create havoc to the surface people with mera and nuidis willem dafoe help and needing to find the true trident of atlantis in order for to claim his rightful place in the throne he will fight against orms army and hired pirates led by black manta yahya abdulmateen iithe plot delivered an epic scale adventure travelling to atlantis that looked like a beautiful colorful city underwater was more astonishing than the avatar film the action sequences are big and well directed there is a lot of action throughout fighting against pirates in a submarine from the epic lifting the sub out of the water the fight scene with atlanna fighting against atlantis soldiers in the opening scene with one long camera take was well choreographed james wan direction of having the camera rotate around the action sequences worked so well he is known for his small budget horror movies like saw and insidious his action style from furious seven and this film was just awesome he delivered a great underwater chase scene that almost felt like tron legacy with the beautiful lighting vehicles and atlantis lighting and the chase scene in italy when and mera are facing against black manta and his soldiers was thrilling the climax battle sequence is breathtaking with and orm ocean master fighting each other was the best choreographed fight scene with the cinematography workthe visual effects are breathtaking when the action is underwater or on land it was great on an epic scale the cinematography work was well done that captured the action and choreography the music score rupert gregonwilliams was great and had a good score that made the movie feel like an adventure also the soundtrack with a few songs in it was great and fun jason momoa was great amber heard is beautiful and great as mera willem dafoe patrick wilson dolph lundgren yahya abdulmateen ii and nicole kidman were all great with their characters james wans direction was brilliant with making an adventure story and epic actionoverall is a great film i say it is the best dc movie out there i definitely recommend seeing this in the big screen in theatres if you are looking for an adventure story and exciting epic action sequences with beautiful stunning visual effects this is the film worth seeing,fantasy
this film made me cry and laugh and gave me goosebumps its an amazing mixture of genres a rich and colourful storyline brilliant acting 20 out of 10 ,fantasy
 was so much fun never bored me once black manta made me have sympathy for the bad guy but at the same time i wanted him to be over the vision and visuals were stunning love how it was an action film but had a lot of wans horror directions must see twice,fantasy
the cgi effects where overpowering the whole movie it was almost impossible to follow the anyway already thin storyline with all the cgi effects going round the whole movie was very predictable if they would have spend more time on the story and character development it could have been a good movie but this way you just see cgi effect everywhere and the story is getting lost apart from that sometimes the jokes seemed forced and cringe,fantasy
the soldiers cannot breath without water when they attack on mera and author in italy but the main characters eg mera atlana etc can breath anywherehow did atlana got injured and got up on the earth meet the lightkeepers,fantasy
the perfect actor jason to bring to life too much special effects more stunts and not on mexican actor its sad were the biggest movie goers plus im a mexican actor dc hope you hire mexican actors diversity but im a aquman now forget the big bang guys ,fantasy
i saw starring jason momoagame of thronestv stargateatlantistv amber heardmagic mike xxl machete kills patrick wilsonthe nun the watchmen and nicole kidmanpaddington batman foreverthis movie is based on a comic book character that was created in 1941 thank goodness their inspiration is based specifically on a more updated story line from 2011 and not the 40s 50s and 60s incarnation was not a real popular hero back in those days in fact lots of people would often make fun of his powershe talked to fish although their are several nods to those more silly yearsremember topo the octopus well he makes a cameo the movie is directed by james wan who is more known for his horror filmssuch as the conjuring  insidious  saw jason plays arthur curryakathe half breed created by a human father and an atlantean mother who learns he is an heir to the throne of the underwater kingdom of atlantis however he has no interest in the title and just wants to stay on the surface world nicole plays his mother jasons half brother patrick believes that he should rulesince he is a full blooded atlantean for the comic book crowd patricks name is orm aka the ocean master amberaka merashows up to the surface world to try and change jasons mind and come rule as the king otherwise patrick will declare war on the surface dwellers battles insue and its an action packed cgi extravaganza especially after another villain named black manta shows up there are a few cameo actors that pop upi liked the dolph lundgren oneand there is a scene just as the end credits start that hints at the next movie but nothing at the very endits rated pg13 for scifi violence action and language and has a running time of 2 hours  23 minutesi must admit is not one of my favorite heroes but i like jason and i really enjoyed this movie i would buy it on bluray,fantasy
theres no shortages of idiotic reviews from critics where no real issues are brought to light about the movie they all seem to complain about unavoidable expected occurances for a movie primarily based under wateroverall it is a well told story with a lot packed in it without the usually feeling of a rushed and jerky scene changes like orher dc movies have in the past jason momoa is perfect as the action sequences are extremely enjoyable the dialogues at times feel a bit off hence the 9 stars not 10 but apart from that id say its one of the best superhero movies out there,fantasy
how can this be was never good it was always a disregarding comics and tv shows so i was ready to make fun of it but no it is a good movie it is not boring at all you should go see it,fantasy
it baffles me that the overall rating is less than an 8 this movie was definitely a wild ride and renewing take on one of the most mocked comic book superheroes thanks to james wan and jason mamoa for bringing this character to lifethe poor reviews so far read like fake news the inconsistencies they attempt to point out like atlantians breathing above water are addressed in the movie so the bad reviewers need to check their hearing aidsi cant wait to see this movie again and again and again definitely a rewatchable movie that im look forward to buying when its released,fantasy
seems like dc and wb has got a winner here this is by far the best comic book movie dcwb has come out with even better than wonder woman the story doesnt meander too much and everything stays on point all the flashbacks are done with great effectiveness especially when speaks to the big bad ass kraken guarding the trident of all tridents and how could you miss with a unbelievable supporting cast comprising dolph lundgren  nicole kidman and willem dafoe also i didnt know the krakens voice belonged to of all people mary poppins herself julie andrews the visuals were amazing but did not overload the senses unlike batman v superman or justice league i hope the people at dcwb now realise you cant replace good storytelling and good acting with outrageous and overwhelming special effects it doesnt work that way it was indeed appropriate that our hero announced his arrival in our superhero consciousness with a commanding tone at the end of the show with i amps with all this momentum going for wonder woman 1984 has a lot to live up to hope it does make it,fantasy
where i come from the water washes away our tearsthe absolute best part about is undoubtedly and unequivocally nicole kidman she had the best lines the best story the best performance and truthfully she had the best fight sequence which sadly is at the beginning of the movie nicole kidman will regrettably be the unsung hero of this filmthe interjections of vulko and arthurs growing past was a lovely touch however zack snyder did a far superior job of that technique in man of steel james wans horror addiction was impossible to ignore especially given how literally the very first shot was a type of jump scare and i appreciated that trademark inclusion the kiss between arthur and mera was also a visual treatbut thats the thing with aqauman it suffers from too many cliches blended together cliches i do and did enjoy even in this film except for them being cliches done better before in other films except perhaps for arthur and meras first kissthe score was a bit scattered and uncomposed while still being satisfying at some parts it was like suicide squad meets green lantern the composition had this tendency of pulling you out of the movie and throwing you back in instead of completely immersing yousuit was not great at all and the atlantean warriors looked quite silly while the atlantean weapon orm gave black manta looked like it came straight out of power rangers and speaking of black manta i wasnt really excited by him unfortunatelyjason momoa is an awesome albeit an unrecognizable one and amber heards beauty more than qualifies her for the role of mera however her acting prowess felt a little out of its depth im a fan of patrick wilson and he did a satisfactory job as did willem dafoe is a fantastic attempt its worth it to see but im not certain it stuck the landing much like arthurs landings in the actual film or the humor except for 2 extremely distinct parts in the film the humor was sahara desert dry 6710,fantasy
the bad whats up with the power rangers constume the costumes were bad the moment the bad guys came i was expecting the theme song go go power rangers and whats up with that flycostume the underworld was ultrafantasy that i felt that was for under 15 movie as an adult 29 years old dont know it it was for me i felt this movies are not for me anymorethe goods great story that added up main character is an alpha male wanted more realistic scenes like logan more blood less power rangers style and all this ultra fantastic fake scene that spoil my dream,fantasy
 is good not brilliant not fantastic its good it might not be the grade it wanted to get nor was it the top it could have gotten but is in its core a good movie it achieves what it set out to achieve entertain and dazzle with stunning visuals and great performances1 the story is the first movie after the justice league debacle in all fairness to the cast and crew jl was not what it should have been so had to come up with a story that was not an origin story yet needed to be one be a sequel to a movie that disappointed hardcore dc fans and restore their faith and tell a unique and entertaining story worthy of the first ever live action movie strangely it succeeded in all of those fields the story is multilayered with a more than a few plots intertwining and moving forward simultaneously as well as the origin storyflashbacks alongside the atlantis originhistory this might sound convoluted but the way the story is told actually doesnt hurt the storytelling there are almost no plot holes and all characters with the slight exception of black mantis are given enough time to provide us with their background philosophy and motivations unfortunately the downside of this is the overall duration of the movie 143 minutes even though the movie doesnt feel very long and there are just enough action sequences to keep the dynamic going there were certain segments that could have been cut a bit short maybe for an uncut edition later on it would be unfair to judge the movie by its length especially because there were many points that needed concluding but a few more riskier editing choices would have made this movie and its story far superior also because of this the final battle that is spectacular in all fairness didnt have that necessary final epic kick this type of movie is known for everything blows up and all hell breaks loose but i found the oneonone battle afterwards to be much more satisfying and epic mainly due to momoas and wilsons stellar action performances2 the acting this movie rounds up much of the old school masters dafoe kidman lundgren wilson and a few very promising newcomers yahya abdulmateen ii heard dafoe was given a beautiful little supporting role that he embraced with such joy that it was a delight to watch him lundgren regardless of him being best known for bmovie action roles executed all of his lines and expressions with such ease and fluidity in such scholar like style that he actually awed me most of all even though erased almost halfway though abdulmateen ii did a decent job nothing spectacular but he set up a good character for the sequels also the sicily fight is one of the highlights of the movie kidman was unfortunately very bland and unceremonious her godlike posture and wooden acting took me away from her character most of all she also had no chemistry with momoa or wilson and her storyline was the one that could have been written and finished better the almost deus ex machina ending with her feels way to happy endish and took much from the dark and gritty fight between momoa and wilson on the other hand another performance for the acting school books is the one executed by patrick wilson his understanding of the character is phenomenal and his execution spot on no line is overacted no expression is unneeded all of his gestures the tone of his voice in every scene is perfect to the point of perfection he alongside dafoe gave the best performance in the movie heard was a bit underwhelming she has a beautiful character to play with but never actually takes her to new levels she took no risks in depicting mera and that is a little sad as she and momoa lead the movie and taking into account that his presence simply dominates every scene he is in heard should have done more like this she is just good momoa however had a dual quality his presence in the movie is breathtaking he lives and breathes with every cell in his body he has fun while doing it but he just does not have the same quality of acting as the others which is quite understandable given he is still a sort of a newcomer compared to the others every scene he is having fun and is telling jokes or is fighting or threatening others is a blast especially when he yells parts of haka but when he has to execute high drama like scenes he simply vaporizes put up against wilson or even heard he looses his intimidation as the acting of the other party outdoes momoas but as all of the dceu characters he is the best live action incarnation of put plainly he is awesome3the directing wan is a superhero he is a god a legend a titan a master even though his specialty is horror his masterful skill at keeping a movie like this so compact and solid is astounding he never looses his grip at what this movie is supposed to be every scene is fixed no improvisation with scalpellike precision certain scenes that seemed to be one take shots were so perfectly developed and performed they literally take ones breath away beautifully orchestrated in every sense of the word directing makes a movie worth seeing over and over again4 the music r gregsonwilliams does a great job he really got certain characters and their themes but it is noticeable that he had much more fun and much stronger ideas in creating the villain tunes than the hero ones simply put needs a better theme but a solid job was done altogetherall in all fixed most of the problems justice league created it also created a path the dceu should follow in a very very straight line and not deter at all this was a correction exam for the dceu and it passed is fun entertaining with spectacular visuals even though most of it is pure cgi and is a pure delight to watch certain characters could have had better execution some story lines could have been omitted or shortened and the music could have been a bit more innovative but all in all is simply a good movie that deserves to be watched over and over again in the highest possible quality and it will always deliver exactly what it sets out to deliver  a good time,fantasy
 is the best of the dc movies after christopher nolan has left us with amazing the dark knight series dc has always tried to copy marvel and this fight will always continue between dc  marvel fans that who is the best among two talking about this movie it is a visual treat to the audiences in 3d specially recommended as one starts feeling itself to be a part of seafor those who has done scuba diving and for those who hasnt its a must watch in 3d talking about the story atlanna nicole kidman is from atlantis an empire under the sea gets married to a man on earth  gives birth to arthur jason momoa whose becomes and is destined to be the ocean master now army from atlantis empire comes to arrest atlanna as she has gone against rules of sea world later on the story is about ending the war between sea world  earth by by acquiring trident of atlan which was owned by the first king of atlantis and now who will acquire this will be the master of ocean movie proceeds with run and chase on earth and sea and then war of sea world empires the movie gives us a visual treat which we will love to watch on big screen  it is a must watch for evry super hero lover but one thing is definitely there that every marvel fan will compare it with marvel movies as the fight between brothers for kingdom with a lot of audience around may be compared between fight shown in black panther the search for atlan in various empires and the sea world with gadgets may be compared to guardians of galaxy and a lot more for all this winding up all in one word is must watch rating 45,fantasy
warner bros and the dcu are no longer a one hit wonder and its about time did what wonder woman was able to do for warner brothers except bigger and better and with this movie under their belt the dc cinematic universe finally feels like its found its footing was a trip the story took us on an adventure unlike anything ive seen since indiana jones or the goonies while a big part of the aesthetic and story in felt very flash gordon or even star wars in its presentation the other half was an exciting treasure hunt reminiscent of an indiana jones movie the character design and world building are brilliantthe few negative criticisms i have are nit picks,fantasy
okay so the visuals in is the best we had seen in the whole dceuthe plot itself is a little bit meh not bad but not good eather and the characters is a little bit cliche especially black manthaone moment is when james wan is using his horror vibes intoand you really see that jason momoa enjoying every second as making it a fun popcorn dceu movie 710,fantasy
 was good ok great but the movie didnt have any great superhero moments too be honest must have done moments with the people of atlantis either kind of saving themtho better than other zack snyder films i guessnot a near film to batman triology sorry guys,fantasy
although this movie isnt better than wonder woman  but it do have give us what a movie needs  the cgi is very great though  and the music  dcs theme always kept it in our mind  and its great,fantasy
so i saw anddddddddd ehhh its not bad but its not goood let me just give you the bad first this movie is too long i kinda felt the same about wonder woman as well but i really felt it here you couldve easily cut down a half hour of this movie and nothing about it wouldve changed the story is serviceable but not new it bears similar resemblance to a marvel phase 1 movie so like thor 1 captain america 1 but it lacks the performances and charisma of either of those i like patrick wilson as an actor but king orm is no loki hes pretty one note and cliched as the movies villain the visuals were a double edged sword so for the bad i would say it just got way too distracting for me infinity war had tons of cgi too but i was invested enough to ignore what wasnt actually real and lastly im just gonna say it story is not interesting call me a hater but ive never liked im sorry theres a reason family guy keeps making fun of him all the time ok but whats good about this movie actually theres a lot of good things the movies visuals while distracting were colorful the dc cinematic universe has stumbled with the zack snyder look thats just gloomy lifeless and boring actually tries to course correct the ship by creating a really bright and well animated world through atlantis the action is epic and ambitious because i can tell james wan is a confident director he definitely gave this movie a nice look so kudos to him on that and lastly jason momoa i cant deny how much i love him in the role his character isnt written as well as it could be but he does what he can and hes so goofy i love it it sounds like i hate this movie but i actually dont it just feels like its trying to get out of their past mistakes by making a safe and marketable movie which is fine but i wanted something new and different heres hoping shazam can give me what im looking for from dc should you go see it well if youre not into superhero movies youre probably not gonna care for this one either if you want to see some good action and jason momoa doin his thing then id say its alright 710,fantasy
this film has got to be one of the most unique superhero films ever created i loved every minute a quarter of the way through and i was already in love the visuals the performances the story and all of the heroic moments in this film makes it a must see the underwater scenes especially the fight scenes are just beautiful if you were looking for an amazing superhero film to see this year this is definitely the one,fantasy
james wan did an excellent job with he he adapted the story from geoff johns throne of atlantis and used bad aery from the new 52 run and i liken jasons look to peter davids 1994 run long hair and beard and they didnt shy away from the silliness of the golden age if you cant tell ive been reading comics for yearsat its core is a love story of two people who had no business being together but through their union came a product that would bring unity between 2 worlds nicole kidman absolutely kills it she needs more action roles i loved the dynamic of arthur and mera jason and amber have great chemistry on screen i love that mera is pushing arthur to become the king even if he doesnt take the task seriously at first along it with being a love story is also a globe trotting adventure movie think indiana jonesromancing the stone they go around the world trying to retrieve king atlans trident andalong the way their bond grows stronger and i loved seeing it play out on screenone thing im a sucker for is an empathetic villainthis film has 2 orms motivation was understandable this film actually had an environmentalists message about how we treat our oceans and orm was not having it patrick wilson did an amazing job as always but to me black manta was more compelling its ironic that even though hes a villain i totally understand his motivation for wanting to kill when you see it youll know what im talking about im mad that his role was so small but it was definitely effective yahyas black manta was a straight savage black manta and had some serious battles over the years in the comics and this film laid some real ground work for that rivalry on the big screen in the first act of the filmthe action scenes in this film is incredible queen atlanna fighting off the soldiers lifting a freaking sub out of the water and taking down the pirates orm vs arthurs gladiator match in the ring of fire the chase through italy the final battle omg the final battle james use of the camera during these scenes is second to none also the scene transitions are greatvisually this is possible the best ive ever seen in a comic book movie this movie should really be considered for an oscar for vfx as well as sfx atlantis was beautiful the final battle was star warsesque but underwater men riding sharks with lasers sea dragons giant crustaceans and arthurs entrance in the final battle is my favorite superhero entrance of the year along with thors entrance to wakanda in infinity war james wan leaned heavily toward his horror roots during the trench sequence the creatures were truly terrifying as was the depth from where they came i love the underwater sound fx as well they put a really cool effect on their voice when they spoke and the wooshing sound it made when during the gladiator matchthis film has a little bit of everything it has heart i had goosebumps at some parts the humor was handled well it didnt overshadow the serious moments great action james wan and company did an excellent job with this one im definitely gonna watch it in imax on my next viewing,fantasy
 is great is it flawedyes but damn what a ride this movie has everything james wan is perfect in his direction and jason momoa is perfect black manta is phenomenal this one time that they kept the comic version for the big screen action adventure drama the movie has it all you will be entertained a for dc and warner brotherseven though they like to screw over the dcunow if only wb would let the directors make the movies they want they would have a successful dcu to rival marvel,fantasy
the movie was fun enjoyed it very muchthe cgi was greatthe action scenes were good but some of them unnecessarythe kingdom of fisherman should have been left out coz they dont have any value in the movie as we are told that they are good people who respect knowledge and avoid conflict it would be great if they saved them for the sequel overall it feels a little tiring at the endit stands at roughly 145 minutes which could be trimmed down to 2 hoursmomoa plays like a goofy guy but he has lot of charisma because he has a lot of chemistry with all the cast including dafoeheardnicole kidman and his father toothe moment in which he appears with the classic suit and the golden tridentthat scene is epicpure magicthe jokes were fine couldve worked with some little of themthe movie starts very fast but it slows a little bit in the middlethe villains were proper characters with a sense of personalityboth of them were distinctones motivation is ambition and the others is rage,fantasy
i just got back from a viewing of and iam glad to say that i got really surprised i went into it with really low expectations after the jl fiasco and now i can say that its one of the best if not the best dc movie ive seen got plenty of vibes of indiana jones and it truly felt like we went of an journey the visuals were also top notch and reminded me a lot of avatar with all the different colours,fantasy
amazing movie one of the best ive seen in a while great visuals very nice plot and you should totally watch it in my opinion,fantasy
it has story from start to end dialogue are well written very long movie but interesting trying to show greek mythology with modern way 3d effects are good,fantasy
dceu has been brought back to the surface world from getting drowned beneath the ocean,fantasy
i think this movie is the best of dc universe lololololololo,fantasy
best visually stunning movie from dc until now intriguing story jason mamoa nailed the role of,fantasy
the changing of the scene has a really amazing transition between them besides the love story of their parents in the end do make me tears up last but not least the thing i love the most is the scaring feel at an instant  sound effect  that james wan has added in this movie for the scene when an enemy pops up,fantasy
james wan did a hell of a job by bringing dceu back to the race this is the beginning of the dceu era i didnt expect that the movie would be good enough to entertain the audience but it was awesome with better graphics than other dceu movies some very funny conversations a good plot and a lot of actions it has all the features of a dc movie with a dark background the movie saved dceu from drowning and also provided a platform to reunite the dceu universe james wan just nailed it the movie worth watching multiple times so forget the past and hit the theatre and watch the under water adventure,fantasy
watched this last thursday near where i lived in got me and my wife tickets for last show of the day 9 pm local and what a treat it was easily the best superhero movie this year better than any dc or even most of marvel movies with few exception of course its hard to kind of describe it in a sentence or two but please take it from me whatever its worth this is a movie worth all the appreciation and please do not let those disneypaid fool you,fantasy
just watched it and have no words to describe the visuals music direction star cast great delivery by dc after the dark knight rises,fantasy
am big fan of mcu but after watching this moviemy mind get totally change so i can say that thus is a one of the best superhero movie i have ever seen ,fantasy
dont believe negative reviews great movie and really entertaining good story acting and amazing visual effects,fantasy
there is no denying that is a damn fun visual spectacle of a superhero action adventure film even if its a flawed one its worth watching on imax for its fantastic underwater visual effects and action sequences alone a lot of visual imagination is put into the underwater city of atlantis the action sequences are beautifully shot and you have a lot of different action set pieces that are a marvel to watch at the big screen is an ambitiously large scale film that tries to go through a lot of world building and backstories even at 2 hours 22 minutes it feels like the film rushed up some of it by mere exposition to save time the large scale nature of the film makes it feel a bit messy at times even if its basic story is simple the age old story of two brothers fighting for the throne one may have seen or read multiple times this one done in a reverse of the way black panther did jason momoa is perfect as the macho hero and has his roguish charm that carries the film amber heard as mera is jaw dropping smoking hot rocking the red hair sharing a nice chemistry with the herothe climatic final battle is pretty epic comparisons to avatar are warranted in regards to its cgi and world building its kinda sad and ironic that the movie in dceu feels the more grander and epic than justice league,fantasy
why you still waste your time here go watch this damn good movie now,fantasy
the movie is really good that will make you want to watch it more than oncebest superhero movie of 2018 after iw,fantasy
jason momoa killed this movie it was epicfyi james wan is a genius,fantasy
the movie is amazing on so many levels it has a nice continuous storyline the cast perform wonderfully throughout the movie and the overall outcome is visually striking thank you james wan as well as those who were involved in the making of the movie its so worth watching ,fantasy
the most beautiful thing ive watched in dceu but its not the best i can say its one of the best james wan really moved things in a good direction for dceu,fantasy
im gonna let others to talk about the plot cgi etc im just gonna comment on the final sceneending clips that was just awesome probably the most spectacular scene ive ever seen swims fast in the water and emerged to he surface with sheer power and sunset as background,fantasy
i went in expecting the best from james wan and i got it was a an action packed rollercoaster of a film with exelent camera work amazing action stunning visuals and well written characters go see this movie,fantasy
asusual some routine story with plot set beneath water world good movie james wan did a great work,fantasy
i watched this yesterday with low hopes as dceu was doing bad business except wonder woman but after watching i was totally spellbound with jasons acting and vfx jason mamoa amber heard and james wans creativity and the relationship between and mera and definitely vfx is what works with this movie the story is not new to me as i have been watching the dcau which is better than the dceu story is nothing new and dont believe the ratings who gave 16 and 910 it is not that bad nor it is that awesome it deserves 75 to 8,fantasy
this movie was absolutely fantasticfirstly after the disappointment that was justice league that i still enjoyed considering its flaws i was super hyped up for this this was my most hyped movie for year because of director james wan thats the only reason i was even remotely looking forward to itthen all the great marketing came out that i rewatched multiple times because the trailers were so good and didnt spoil anythingthis film was absolutely breathtaking and i put it up there with christopher nolans the dark knight,fantasy
finally a worthy dc movie to compete with marvel cinematic universecast storyline and cg are all great cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
i was forced to come watch as i wasnt really looking forward to watching i had no high hopes that this movie will surpass my superhero movie standards but man this movie is riveting despite all the cliches i thought fighting seahorses and sharks is funny but it all made sense great job for james wan,fantasy
best superhero movie jason mamoa shines amber heard is gorgeousin this movieone of the best origin storybut hope to see more black manta in future,fantasy
screen play is average  action sequences are excellent you may fell story is cliche but all in all movie is better than infinity  vfx are amazing,fantasy
this movie really shines in everythingjames wan did a fantastic jobits released in india a week ahead the international releasemanthe visuals and cinematography are so greataction sequences are amazingthe fight seuence in italy was phenomenalactors did a fantastic jobjason momoa is apt aswan gave equal importance to female lead mera played by amber heardshe is gorgeousthe vfx was greatthe story line is simple and marvel fans will relate it to black panther as both has similar story linebut the screenplay was fantasticthis is an adventure cum super hero movie which suited really wellkoodos to the whole teamwe wanted movies like this rathar than dull and dark themed snyder moviesjames wan revived dc,fantasy
boy oh boy what an awesome mind blowing experience it is visualy it is the best experience ive ever had jason momoa is so great as an its like this character was created for him i must say khal drogo has new identity now it is one of those movies you wanna keep watching over n over again coz you cant have enough best things i loved most about this movie are its action n cinematography,fantasy
insofar this is the best of dc in terms of presentation like cgi fx cinematography this is better than infinity war the film is very well coordinated from sound fx up to the smallest detail the experience of the atlantis is just awesomein comparison to other dc films in terms of origin story gives the briefest of them all unlike man of steel and wonder woman,fantasy
im still a tad bit confused this movie is beautifully shot well written exciting and funny this movie single handily introduces a bad ass atlantis to a new generation you see my confusion isnt with the movie my confusion lies within the critics hating everything dc and loving marvel i am an avid superhero fan regardless of which medium they appear but if movies like this are demolished in reviews by movie critics who suckled the mouses teet we wont have a chance to see these characters develope into their best versions awesome time watching would definitely watch again,fantasy
if you are masochist go watch itin short whole movie is full of cgi already seen in past movies tron avatar anything but with lower budget or they just dont care anymore having really bad costumography  got feeling i was watching power rangers not funny at all i mean really like someones messing with us full of bad acting  periodadditionally constantly ive been asking myself who wrote these idiotic dialogues or standards are getting lower or who da hell is this chick amber heard and why is she in the movie anywayoverall  2 and half hours gone with the wind ,fantasy
this movie is just to feed your ego it shows some kind of homeless man wild and crazy and assertively says i am no king and of course there is a woman who betray his tobe husband and go for this homeless man and say you should be king and a hero how great is that to make anybody feel like he can be like a king a hero and somebody who would steal another woman from another guy doesnt that make you feel good and of course blah blah blah he is just so good the important people such as the wifetobe and the counselor betray their king to help this guy and of course the younger brother who is opposing him is made to look like evil there is also a bad guy who after killing random people actually said that should have mercy and save his father when his father was trapped by a fallen object that was really fair and actually kind of thought maybe he should have saved his father too when and the betraying woman both fall and can get killed by the thousands of sea creatures for some reason they have the flame light to keep these creatures away so it was just a coincidence that they were able to see those flaming light device so what if they didnt see it then they are dead in silicon valley i see these wild crazy guys who thought they are like a hero all the time when they dont even test their software code and push to the web server and crash everything and then they backstab other coworkers it is guys like him that are made to look like a hero and a king and somebody who could steel woman from another man what kind of movie is this it merely is trying to feed the ego of people and make big money,fantasy
the movie starts off so well only because of black manta actually the only great parts were when black manta was on screenhowever this is just another dud for dc so meh and predictable is no thor because he lacks the charisma and dominance like thor has the bad boy of the justice league movie is absent in this movie he is a almost a beta but still a tough guyi could barley hear some of the under water dialogue the scene with atlantis on land i didnt get why it was destroyed most of the lines were just lame and genericthe costumes were good cgi and green screen were so obviousbetween justice league movie and movie i believe there were contradictions but who knows or has time to list them since both movies were boringthe brotherly rivalry sucks its no where near thor and lokionly positives are black manta and the giant lobster at the end i wasnt sure why there was a big fight at the end probably because the dialogue throughout the movie was greatly bad tries to be thor at the end and fun yet fails ocean master is more fit to be king despite his actionsdc is 1 and 5 within the dceu its best to skip shazam because it will likely repeat its predecessors formula2 out of 10 only watch if you like boring movies and want to sleep,fantasy
jason and amber are actually quiet good just wish that the story wasnt so utterly stupid lol the scenes are disjointed jumping around from plot points black mantis was forgettable and unneeded there were some strange music choices that didnt fit the film it was overly ambitious trying to cram to much in they should have given us the story of atlantis not this shamble of a war flick,fantasy
maybe for lots of ppl its bad but for me its very cool the visuals is amazing i like how they put like every genre of movie beautifully most ppl who hates it maybe have bad blood with dc movies or is a die hard fans of mcu well i like mcu too but its not that bad to the point of giving it 12 in the rating just to make it looks bad jason momoa literally is a prefect i really love the actions and the shots in the end of battle really so dc for me like everyone always judge the jokes is not that much and its not like batman cringey joke in previous dc movies and i dont think they tried to be like mcu maybe they just trying to find their own style to fit this future generation i actually thought some of it as funny for haters maybe you guys are just oldies try hard to be edgy people i still rewatch it at least 3 times since its amazing and have so dclike shots with that filter i actually felt a lot of emotions and heart throbbing time for a lot it may be overrated but for me i truly like it from the true fan  i think its one step to the future dc and the shots is elegant thanks tojames wan and the crew,fantasy
 is simply outstanding a must watch movie simply ignore the negative reviews if you like stories and a bit of action youre gonna love it,fantasy
what the hell did i just watch possibly one the worst movies ive seen in my 47 years wooden acting convoluted story its about 30 minutes too long bad cgi and corny not in a clever thor ragnarok kind of way dc set a really high bar with wonder woman and i was hoping that they had finally cracked the code the costumes were super cool however bad bad bad,fantasy
i didnt like this movie lame jokes same story told 100x times before cgi was weak the movie was passable maybe worth watching on netflix or cable,fantasy
being a fan of the dceu i had high hopes going into this film however after seeing it i was very disappointed and while seeing it i felt very embarrassed for dc the movie has its good moments here and there but overall the film was a mess the pacing was off the effects and cgi were overdone and mediocre the plot filled with holes and obscurity even for a superhero film and the dialogue was very weak the dialogue was lazy and cliche overall the movie was terrible one of the worst of 2018,fantasy
fantastic plot was amazing visualisation beyond our imagination action packed must watch film of the year,fantasy
stilted dialog boring exposition superficial characters transparent plot when is dc going to learn that superhero movies are more than just special effects and cool fight scenes they actually have to do some of the things any good movie normally does,fantasy
jason momoa was born to play he is perfect for this roll i have seen him game of thrones but this is the part he was made for the movie was great lot of action and drama in it the only par i hope that doesnt come true is his hand being cut off,fantasy
trust me this movie is one headturner from normal dceu movie with a twist cinematography and editing with utmost priority along with jason mamoas charismatic performance must watch,fantasy
i have to say this movie thoroughly surprised me considering it is a dc film i was not expecting much james wan does an incredible job with this film the action sequences are phenomenal the dialogue is good enough and this film does a great job of staying in its element what i mean by this is that it mostly focuses on alone and doesnt have too many subplots is it enough to save the dc universe probably not but as a stand alone film it is highly entertaining if you are on the verge of seeing this film do yourself a favor and give it a chance,fantasy
really good an entertaining explain another point of view of this superhero,fantasy
i was never bored and loved it the movie was awesome but the war scene were a bit mutchbest dc movie i have seen,fantasy
this is a great movie mera orm atlana and manta were great and james wan delivered an exciting movie thanks james wan,fantasy
not sure if its bots or people who are dcu fanboysgirls with massively rosetinted glasses but noway is this movie a 9 or a 10comparisons with avatar are a joke both films used a lot of cgi but thats where the similarities begin and endthere was some good comedic and charming moments here but they were few and far between overall the script and the storyline were so cliched that it was cringeworthy at times every plot twist was predictable and obvious from the outset which made the film boringthe lack of character development meant i wasnt invested and didnt care how things turned out  i was just waiting for it to end for the last 45 minutes of the movie the main villains  black manta and orm were onedimensional cliches and lacked any depth or personalitythe cgi was overused and at times the fight scenes got a bit silly  a few fish swimming through and destroying metal craft    erm sure thats totally believable ditto a man gets trapped under rubble which would have crushed his legs but when its moved he gets up and walks awayjason momoa was the best thing about this film  he played his role well but didnt have much to work with scriptplot wise,fantasy
after you watch it you surely want to watch it againjust like me,fantasy
lot of strategy is played to put in dc but failedhow  wen released they put spider verse to a fight so  so they can put dc down and pull its leg  but dc got really lucky to win and aqua is good  same old story but very different,fantasy
really good for mei like this movietis is just my opinion,fantasy
ignore all jealous marvel fanboys and go see the movie,fantasy
i went to this movie based on the reviewsyou owe me 50 i have not wanted to walk out of a movie for a couple years now but this was the one acting was good but plot and movie in generalbeyond words save money save time and save brain cells avoid this movie,fantasy
i dont recall much of of the original comics but somehow this is a bit too far fetched when you have a celebrity like nicole kidman in the movie as the mother of you know the whole story is a bit far fetched given she doesnt die but is made to have been the blood curling reason for to become king and fight his pureblood brother the whole story is just a little ott i guess the graphics were great but the fight scene between the crabs and the atlantis did not make sensehow about a movie that is more story one and less graphics,fantasy
im sure every 10 year old will give this 1010 but for adults its 310 i was expecting something like new marvel movies but this did not even come close go see with your kids they will love it,fantasy
i dont understand why people are so upset with this movie for me its completely normal and ridiculous the plot twist was so easy to guess that why when mom still alive me absolutely no suprises at all the script is pretty weird it made to become a coward because when he lost the battle but he was saved by his brothers fiance  i mean its so damn weird the circuit kept jumping and the man who lost his father i thought he would play a big role in making trouble in saving the alantis and he was defeated easily in spite of having a super armor and king orm is that right was much stronger than just because had a trident and he is the lead male so he won that made me unable to submit this result and the power of its suckmy english is not so good to make a long comment so,fantasy
we really enjoyed the difference in this  the cartoons we grew up on is a great addition to marvel comics updated ,fantasy
expect a bumpy ride because some action scenes were lit and memorable some cliches bored me to a standstill because it was used recycled somewhere earlier in mcu,fantasy
finally dcwarner bros has made a character other than wonder woman interesting their issue has always been batman is batman everyone knows him superman is superman everyone knows him has always been a joke as far as characters go but in this he is awesome even the villains have a reason for their acts not just to be bad just to be bad guys dc needs to do what they are doing now make the second tier characters yes wonder woman is part of dcs trinity but still a far third to batman and superman special and save the big guys batman and superman for justice league and team up movies hit on so many levels too fantastic visuals great action and even a tight story without being overly dark well done dc well done indeed,fantasy
hi elliot g jazz herestunning brilliant staggering flawless marvellous thrilling super superb genius magnificent fantastic inventive exciting unmissable wonderful joyous as you can obviously tell i kinda liked this fantasy superhero sci fi movie a bityes its great going to my weekly cinema fix and coming out feeling happy and fulfilled many times of which are rare these days especially with the well over 50 flicks i see yearly in cineworld from the very beginning till the end i was glued to those out of this world fx i said to my pal tam  how the hell do they do it  well actually i kinda know the effects are created using back engineering from the crashed ufo in rosswell in 1947 only kiddin a great hand to all envolved in creating those mind blowing fxat many times throughout the film i was reminded of many moments from and including great films i grew up watching namely that romantic boxing from it happened one night 1934 with claudette colbert  clark gable sean connerys wittly comedic one liners from the 60s bond movies and all those exciting moments from indiana jonesi like to think of myself as a wannnabee casting agent and after seeing the brilliant inventive saw 2004 i knew there and then we had a maestro of a movie maker by the name of james wan on our hands more from this terrific director please i loved everything about this movie the wonderful narrative powerhouse acting fx and so on it was also nice seeing the new zealand actor temura morrison who you may or not remember gave a powerhouse performance in once were warriors 1994 patrick wilson who was in the unsettling superb movie little children 2006 and hard candy 2005 more than most plays the charismatic good guy so its interesting seeing playing the not so bad guy i wasnt that keen on woderwoman which i thought was kinda boring and a little dissapointing  on the other hand didnt disappoint it was a pure blast,fantasy
 tries to be much things an epic and breathtaking blockbuster an environmental aware a romantic comedy an action film a hunting treasure adventure and so onit only accomplishes to be a good action film although the script and direction is kind of attractive doesnt disappoint much there are some plot holes and confusing decisions,fantasy
not terrible awesome cgi and decent action sequences but overshadowed by very cheesy acting and one liners overall i think its a great superhero movie for kids but amusing for the adult audience,fantasy
this movie sucks so bad do not waste your time i cant strees how bad everything is the ubercorny screenplay the horrible costume design the super sucky animation the incredibly boring storyline i understand they were going for kids but dude this is bad,fantasy
this movie falls on the tier of the better half of all dc movies and can be called the second best dceu movie the movie has one of the best cinematography of all time probably falling just shortly behind avatar the visuals are stunning cinematography aside this movie is quite dull in terms of plot it has an extremely thin plot and story buildup you will be left scratching your head at the sequence one moment a character appears another moment another character appears and the worst part is that it is highly predictable also character buildup is weak the villain is a villain for the sake of being a villain there isnt an extra motivation for why he chose the path of the aggressive but jason momoa and amber heard were amazing and their chemistry was magnificent the latter will especially be benefited for that jason momoa with his charm steals the show but we cant say the same for the villain and the plotnot a bad movie at all but not a movie to blow your minds either,fantasy
if you want a movie that is full of fight scenes with actual people as well as animated creatures action and animated villains is the movie for you however if you happen to desire a movie with a script a storyline and actual acting then you will pass by this is one of the worst movies that i have seen in years i cannot tell you the number of bad movies which i have watched hoping that they will improve before the movie ended however i knew that that would never happen with so i actually left with about 30 minutes to go so that my entire evening would not be a total waste of time it is therefore my recommendation that you save 143 minutes of your life that you will never get back and go to the movies to see something else other than,fantasy
i saw this movie in hz china i did not like this preview a lot and i saw this movie because many reviews said this is best dc movie1st opening scene was great and different than other supernice super hero moviesbut for rest of movie there is zero tension for 2hrs too much graphic and combination of other adventure movies does not save this moviealso i dont like ending like disney movie,fantasy
play it is fast and easy to view a good way to spend your time be the best,fantasy
lots of long loud boring speeches long long slabs of exposition lots of lame mission statements  go to the hidden blah blah and find the sacred such and such what no singing bush momoa is charismatic but wilson in not and poor kidman in that costume the worst dc movie so far,fantasy
neither the narratives nor the visuals are convincing the plot is simply a mess and lacks any sense of credibility the storytelling is awful with no buildup or climax the visuals are completely fake and do not look real at all james wan should go back to direct cheap horrors,fantasy
visuals great otherwise everything sucked if you dont care about plot than go ahead but if you care about plot forget it,fantasy
just i never thought i will see such an amazing film from dc  for me best dc movie yet,fantasy
fell in love with atlantis and also the princess jason mamoa makes everything better the movie was awesome amazing visuals and breathtaking battles overall an amazing movie had a great time watching,fantasy
seen this tonight  must say i was impressedthe storyline is pretty decent the effects are epic  dazzlingthe characters were pretty good  the action is pretty solidbut my complaint for this film is that it suffers from the draggingonitis which kind of let it down as it couldve been snappier  more rapid in both action  story tellingbut overall the film was pretty good  solid for what it was roll on auqaman 2810,fantasy
you have seen it before you have known it beforethe effects were good for surebut majority of movie there was hardly any excitementjasons character is not well developed and it is immature for almost most of the timethe love angle was little cringyafter 23rd i did get excited for a war but after that it comes back to being dull againhumour is okayishvisuals were greatall in alla movie you have seen before,fantasy
looking forward to this dc movie absolutely rubbish  cley shayed rubbish  stoped watching after about 20 minutes  also bad graphics,fantasy
this film felt long i couldnt wait for it to endthe characters were not that believable but the acting of the majority was goodfunny how younger brother looks older than himcgi was satisfactoryi liked the female led action sequences,fantasy
it was so entertaining and full of great visual effects just by a huge budget everyone could make these hard scenes,fantasy
reviewi was very excited for this movie and went into it with high expectations and it really delivered the dceu or the dc extended universe really need a life preserver after what was a cluster of mediocre films that started this up and coming franchise there were some hits man of steel and wonder woman and there were some misses batman v superman dawn of justice and suicide squad was a movie that needed to be a full hit and i believe it succeededthe movie starts out with a bit of background information with how arthur currys mom and dad meet who are played by nichole kidman and temuera morrison we understand why arthur is the way he is when we flash forward to him all grown up the movie takes place after justice league and story is told very well and explains the timeline in a subtle way thats its there but down being shoved down our throats the movies main focus is on arthur trying to stop a full out war between humans and atlanteans arthurs brother played by patrick wilson is the king of the atlanteans and is planning an attack on the humans and when arthur hears the news about the attack goes back to atlantis so stop iti have not been a fan of kidmans work at all and was going into this movie hoping she was just going to be in it for a minimal amount of time but ended up wishing her character was in the film a lot more temuera morrison does a great job being the human character in this family and brings a lot of heart to the role as for himself jason momoa i dont think anybody else couldve played this character and it be taken seriously as good as this man has director james wan knew who he had in front of the cameras and utilized him so good amber heard willem defoe and patrick wilson all do a great job playing these different side characters that help build this world and keep the story runningthe action in this movie is so good i was able to ignore my disbelief with some stunts that were being done because it was explained that atlanteans cant be hurt by human weapons the camera angle and color scheme of the movie really made all the different places  whether it be in atlantis a small fishing village or the desert  feel real i could have done without the relationship aspect between jason momoa and amber heard i didnt believe that the chemistry was there and it felt forced i also wish we could have seen more of black manta in this movie i understand they were probably just teasing us with the character and will see more of him in the sequel but he was better antagonist than king ormoverall if you are a fan of superhero movies then you can have a good time with this movie it tells a great story with characters that will keep you engaged the whole way through455,fantasy
not worth the money like the rest of dc movies theyre far behind marvel in all aspects clearly in this movie as well,fantasy
this is another hollywood formulaic superhero junk that completely misrepresents the core philosophy of atlantis jason momoa was behaving like a teenager with one liners and a cavalier demeanor throughout the movie bad acting overdone cliched story and romantic sub plot they make these kinds of movies for video game addicted nerds a disgrace,fantasy
bad acting especially by jason momoa hes really bad dont watch,fantasy
given the right material jason momoa can occasionally be awesome but not oftenas as he was in justice league he is awful he just doesnt fit the part and thats a shamein this standalone story hes surrounded by clicheridden setpieces bad dialogue nichole kidman bloody awful for a mother and a lame quest to find the trident yawn theres no danger no real motivation for anything and a villain who looks more like the robot from lost in space than a threat here we have yet another conquer the world tale told in an uninteresting way with overblown cgi filling the screen dulldc movies seem to be getting more and more dreadful with each installment as the brothers warner try to keep up with marvel dominating the box office forget this one save your money and 2 hours you wont get back,fantasy
610  despite a solid performance from amber heard innovative cinematography and impressive visual effects this one fell short,fantasy
wellwere do i start octopus playing drums is like manchild the dialog is like a disney teen movie and corny predictable warships and plastic thrown back at humans by destroying man made building wtf  politics and climate issues in movies does not workso stop doing itthis is the end of the dc moviesvisually it is fascinating 3 starsi hope this saves someone 220mins of suffering,fantasy
its alright cheesy in places definitely worth a watch to see background probably never going to watch again,fantasy
easily the most likeable and relatable character in the dcu seemed like a sure bet as a great movie and origin story he stole the show in justice league so i was so excited at the chance for his character to be given the justice of an entire moviethat lasted about 20 minsthat plot for this movie is about as watertight as a pasta strainer despite the generous liberties we take with regards to plausibility in superhero movies from the distracting and unnecessary underwater vocal effects to the complete and utter assault on your senses due to the visual overkill with the final big battle this movie quickly became a gigantic parody of itself the plot twists of the creature protecting the trident and ending up being ridden by into the final battle and his mother still being alive were things even my young children called out way before it happenedall in all this was just a jumbled forgetable and garbled mess yet somehow it filled seats im still looking forward to the sequel though,fantasy
it really isnt surprising that is one of the most successful dc movies they figured out marvel movies are much better accepted by the audience they tried to make one marvel style film and they failed miserably honestly this story needs at least 1 more hour to be told without rushing half of the scenes that are performed by jason amber nicole and almost every other actor are extremly cringey and i dont even want to talk about graphics that look like video game its beautiful but its unreal and i know its not supposed to be quite realistic but at several moments i was very disturbed by graphics the whole story is just bad and cheap and honestly if it wasnt dc movie and if it was done with less money everyone would see that it isnt that good is it the worst superhero movie nope is it the best superhero movie definitely 100 no is it good thats debatable in my opinion no but hey people seem to love it its just very disappointing,fantasy
please dont watch this movie when youre in the mood of watching a good movie its traight out terrible,fantasy
its just a massive dump of cgi and one liners surprisingly boring with mediocre acting but at least it is pretty to look at we are seeing way to many of these sort of movies lately,fantasy
wow  the story was well written and perfect the acting was fantastic  jason and amber were great and they did a great job  the cgi were marvelous i like the underwater scenes they really catched my eyes i had a great time watching this movie  and i recommend it to all810,fantasy
a combination of thor how to train your dragon godzilla and black panther,fantasy
predictable storyline embellished with eye candy cgi and the leading ladies kidman and heard,fantasy
my biggest problem with the film is the overall design is to be blunt a psychedelic blur with no proper sense of scope each section of the film has its own fundamentally incompatible aesthetic on their own each of the kingdoms can be quite beautiful but there was no thought of how they fit together more problematic the various sections are all by narrative descended from a single source but dont actually look they do i just dont see the connection between say the fishmen and the kingdom of the brine this gives the film a very episodic feel and the tone never quite settles into a coherent film the film is very ugly as a resultit doesnt help that the storyline is overly complicated a bit like black panther the film is rooted in hamlet and when it sticks to its royal drama structure it is compelling yet the film feels the need to inject the macgruffin questline and an rushed origin story for manta to pad its run time the characters are too often going from point a to point b with no time to breath i still am not sure what the extent of and others abilities are no one seemed to suffer from any flaws the story is a jumble of ideas and when such concepts as ocean master is part of the story it becomes laughable quite quicklyunlike most dc films this one doesnt suffer from the brooding humorless tone the character is at least engaging and charming he isnt saddled with just tragic backstory to be oh so dark now the film is still quite bad but at least dc seems to be aware of the problems hopefully they will one day make a good filmbut we are still waiting that day,fantasy
aside from the odd mix up of the arthur legend to atlantis the cgi was just too awful that it eclipses whatever redeeming quality this movie has if i were to rate the action sequences overlooking the effects obviously it was typical hollywood slam bang the acting was okay not one scene moved me but it didnt make me cringe either the glaring thing really was the terrible effects it was like watching the movies inside the ps games,fantasy
bad characters bad story ugly cgi bad movie wasted time,fantasy
rented this movie and watched it twice we really enjoyed it despite a few songs that were horrible a few cheesy moments but its a superhero moviethose are kind of expected was disappointed they changed his eye color though as it was ice blue in the justice league a storyline based on more icelandic culture wouldve been interestingi did like that he was down to earth no pun intended,fantasy
no really this beats 34 of the superhero movies lately its cheesy its stupid its not even acted properly but it works as a wholei watched it twice just to be sure stunning visuals not a moment of bore frenzy pace and a coolness factor turned up to elevenclearly the director knew what he wanted to achievemore movies like this and less like the pompous and boring avengers endgame,fantasy
a 9 for me is the perfect movie a 10 means it is pushing all the right buttons for me the 6 means it is really average but genrefans might like it a 7 would be a recommendation to buy the bluray but i certainly cannot recommend anything like thisfrom all the critics and the ratings i really thought this is going to be a good movie here are some points why it is notnicole kidman and the father have 0 chemistry why in earth would a queen be interested in this guy we will never know when they meet again at the end of the movie at the dock and run towards each other i actually laughedamber heard cannot act very well she is a beautiful woman no doubt but she could not carry her weight in the storyjason momoa cannot act good enough for a main lead he can act he has done a good job but there are way too many scenes where he fails miserably to transport emotions just playing the badass is not enoughwhat is up with the extremely colourful over the top cgi if i want to watch a big war like this i will watch a space opera not a single time i thought cool all the time i thought hey this is like shooting scenes in the 70s long drawn out completely meaningless without anything really happening for minutesthe story was completely predictable from minute one the only twist was for me that was not betrayed by the character of willem dafoethe costumes look so plastic the weaponry the armor here was a possibility to show creativity how would weapon and armor look like of an army from the deep sea the movies answer just like on land only colourful and plastique lookingagain 0 chemistry between momoa and heard why would they love each other because the script says soreally why is worthy because the script says so why should a creature that protects a weapon for 1000s of years without eating anything biology anyone hand that weapon over to because he is like king arthur and pulls excalibur from king atlan that was so cheesy and stolen it made me cringe in the insidei nearly forgot about the black manta when he was on screen with his ridiculously big helmet for the first time i had to laugh is there a more laughable ridiculous villain in any moviei am actually really sorry for the dc fans while wonder woman was a great movie amazing timing and good enough acting this is the only movie that stands out everything else is just not goodjustice league or are so far away from the quality of even average marvel movies it hurts,fantasy
i didnt like it much honestly however i admit that visual effects are amazing,fantasy
was very hyped for this movie but let down so badly visually it was top notch and jason momoa was surprisingly decent that said the story is atrocious the story is so bad that when i found the comic the film was based on i bought it to see how it compares let me say this if you had hope for this movie but were let down go read the comic because its brilliant they tried to take the whole run on that geoff johns wrote and shove it into one movie i feel like theres to many writers on this movie 2 people writing the screenplay and 3 writing the story seems like too many hands in the kitchen,fantasy
bad acting horrible cgi even a worser script than every movie i ever saw before a complet waste of time and money unvoluntarily funny during the serious moments and not funny when it supposed to be this is really an achievement sorry for my english its not my native language,fantasy
i know the 13 to 20 somethings are going to rave about special effects and action but the story is meaningless and while there is a good solid cast they were given very little to work with and the acting suffers for the poor screenplaystay homesave your money and your time,fantasy
was expecting a marvel standard of film this is way off the mark started off ok but quickly turned into an over cgied dull movie with terrible acting its a long film over 2 hours i lasted just over half way through before turning it off this has to be one of thd worst movies ive ever watched,fantasy
first off nicole kidman is truly rubbish painful to watch the costume we see her in at the end made me laugh out loudsecondly you have to suspend your disbelief with all superhero movies but this one just takes it too farand try as they may dc cant for the life of them get the same balance of action rounded characters and humour that marvel has mastered,fantasy
i have seen some truly poor movies in my lifetime but doesnt deserve to be in that category thats because i dont consider it a movie as to do so would be an insult to truly poor moviesthe special effects are so poor that this could pass for a cartoon plus im all for stretching the laws of physics in science fiction but human bodies even if they can breathe underwater dont fly backward into walls with such force as to break the walli felt like i was watching an underwater equivalent of the thor trilogy crammed into about 212 hours the humor was more than flat  it was dead worst of all this whole film was predictable i say it a lot that ive seen this story under different titles thats due to the dearth of imagination in corporate hollywoodthe kiddies will be impressed their mommies and daddies will approve of the nonsexual nature of the relationship between the two main charactersit can almost be said that theres too much story to tell and the writers had no idea of how to tell it  a dc movie trademarkmiss this title at all cost,fantasy
there are no amount of effects none zero that can replace good acting in this film there is no acting at all the action was soulless nothing special the story line is the worstspecial effects  bad acting  terrible filmnow where did i leave that old copy of superfriends oo,fantasy
looks more like a video game than a moviecgi overkillzero character build upcorny scriptalmost nonexistent storyline what there is appears to have been written by a twelve year oldmajor disappointment and frankly just plain boring,fantasy
hiring james wan to direct has thankfully injected some spirit into the dc universewith the dark and depressing first instalments coming from zack snyder and then a more upbeat effort in the form of wonderwoman wans film has elevated dc to be a genuine rival for marvel in terms of a cinematic offeringif you have the opportunity to watch on a 4k display with hdr then this is a must see movie more on that later tells the story of arthur curry played with relish by the charismatic jason momoa a film that my better half wasnt interested in seeing until she clapped eyes on a shirtless momoahe may not be the greatest actor in the world but he surely owns every scene hes inhis character is half human half from atlantis and his quest is to prevent his brother king orm from waging war on the surface dwellersits all a bit silly but still immensely entertaining and rather inventivemade so by some impressive visuals and direction by james wanset design and cinematography are reminiscent of james camerons avatarfrom underwater cities to breathtaking landscapes this is one spectacular looking movieevery scene is a visual feast and as i mentioned this is a must see movie in 4k hdrthe higher resolution will allow colours to burstfrom your tv and the added layer of detail help bring underwater kingdoms and creatures to lifehigh dynamic range is utilised here to reference quality a must have purchase on ultra high definition bluray if like i you are into home cinemacolours are so superb that this will be your new go to disc to impress friends with your set upparticular scenes such as the end battle show hdr to its full potentialdepth is pretty decent too which helps the underwater environments have a sense of realismsubtle details are finely renderedtake princess meras long flowing red hair for examplehdr allows her hair to be very vibrant whilst a grain free digital image shows every strand of hair on the princesses headcostumes are also superbly presentedevery scale on gold suit is distinctive and king orms purple chest armour is so bright it almost looks three dimensionalthere are some soft shots particularly when cgi is at its heaviest but youd be hard pushed to notice i found the scene on the cargo plane to be flawless a true 4k crispy imageif the picture quality is excellent then the dolby atmos sound mix is equally impressiveon ultra high def bluray this is reference quality toothe lfe channel gets deep down and dirty with some floor shaking bassthe scene in the trench will have your subwoofer working overtimethe atmos mix utilises height channels superbly allowing atmospherics to blend in seamlesslysound stage is wide and energetic making for a truly exciting surround sound experiencea good sound mix is one that envelops the listener without them being aware and this one achieves this impressivelywith a stellar supporting cast this film has a further ingredient to be a successat 2hrs 23mins james wan has sculpted a movie that flows just like waterenough time is devoted in fleshing out the characterssure more could have been done with the two lead villains patrick wilsons king orm and yaha abdulmateen ii as manta are possibly the most underdeveloped of all the cast but this barely hinders the sheer enjoyment of the moviejason momoa and amber heard as mera have a believable chemistry and hollywood superstars nicole kidman and willem dafoe bring the gravitasdolph lundgren puts in a second great performance of 2018 after his welcome return in creed iithe script and delivery of dialogue is punchy and jokes land with precision is well made in all aspects and takes the dc universe out of the gloomi have no problem with the darkness of batman vs superman i just believe that will appeal to a larger audience because its more colourful and funif its spectacle youre after then delivers big timeit may not be as deep as say logan or the dark knightit may not have the years of backstory that was dedicated to the avengers but is a vibrant treat that so far the dc universe has been missinglong live king arthur,fantasy
i was absolutely blown away fantastic action scenes mamoas endless supply of fresh charisma a compelling villain a romance that feels genuine what else could you ask for,fantasy
i gotta say i really enjoyed this film it was by no means perfect but i really appreciate the direction they took arthur currys character i wasnt really a fan of the character in justice league so i was a little apprehenisve about this film at first by jason momoas portrayal in this completely won me over hats off to james wan and everyone involved this along with wonder woman have really shown that dc movies and characters can be great ive always been a dc fan so its nice to finally have a couple films out there that show just how amazing these characters can be and how amazing the stories surrounding them can be its not a matter of choosing between marvel or dc both are awesome in their own rights so its nice to see dc making the movies that the fans and characters deserve,fantasy
its official it takes two to three years of movie watching to understand what makes a bad film compared to a good fileif you are under two yearsreviewed a very small number of filmsgave this movie anything more then a 7i will assume you are a bot or paid by the studiosif you respond and say you are not a bot or paid by the studios that will only confirm that you are a bot or paid by the studios,fantasy
the villains were substantially better fleshed out and you substitute a hot dude for a hot chickthis movie also took itself substantially less seriously which helped it out a lotfinally while being far from great this movie is at least tolerable on rewatch,fantasy
this should be categorized as comedyas its not i give it one starfor its ridiculous exaggerations and cringemaking kitsch,fantasy
star wars episode 1 though it was clever by being 99 cgi and then we all realised that was unnecessarily gross dc however missed the memothe original tv version of the power rangers was less cringeworthy and had less plot holes than this,fantasy
really poor bad script bad special effects  just crap in general funny how some of the characters hair moves underwater yet others dont move an inch dc really dont have a clue on how to make a really great superhero movie  when superman and batman actors quit  need i say anymore ,fantasy
its surprisingly good great acting from jason and amber brilliant storytelling and screenplay truly awesome  watched it for the 3rd time today possibly the best dc movie till date looking forward for the sequel,fantasy
first time in a long time i didnt get lost in fight scenes i was very surprised in a good way,fantasy
people who write screen plays know one thing how to make a boring movie they use one formula to create a movie which people will go to watch but then never want to see it again because the replay value is zeromovies with substance have replay value a movie such as citizen cane glory lincoln clockwork orange gone with the wind grapes of wrath dr strangelove or to kill a mockingbird all great movies which you can watch again to see a lesson in life about real people with real problems played by great actors and great directors and great screen writersyes is fantasy but it lacks a connection to being a person there is no desire to know the main character or cheer for them you already know they are going to win you already know they will succeed the writing is so bad that they show you the finishing move for the final battle which is never used at any other time in the movie its a copy cat script of several dozen other movies in the last fifty years where the hero is predicted to win while in the same breath told he cant wingee i wonder what is going to happen at the endyawnsure the action is good there are some good fight scenes but most of it was just a bunch of cgi thrown in for the big summer block buster formula it lacked any fight scenes which i would want to see more than onceanother thing which bothered me is the choice of casting is supposed to be from atlantis he isnt a half breed he isnt from the south pacific the story of the people from atlantis is from the mediterranean why do you think the atlantic ocean is called that its because of atlantisso in closing barf the movie sucks just another crappy movie pumped out by crappy hollywood,fantasy
best of 2018 movie i enjoyed seeing it i suggest you see it,fantasy
this is so cringeworthy and awful i cant believe that people are giving it such good reviews its corny cheesy poor acting and references every movie ive ever seen whoever signed off on this movie should be fired and find a new career path,fantasy
i wont ever get those 25 hours of my life back i would rather have spent then cleaning public toiletssfx equal to thay of avatar and thay alone garnered two pointsgenuinely poor i really hope nothing like this ever happens again ever,fantasy
the acting in this movie was horrible im actually shocked nicole kidman agreed to be in this movie the story line was cheesy my kids enjoyed it though,fantasy
i wasnt a great fan back in the sixties not like i was for the rest of dc pantheon the tv cartoon was part of the superman hour with that guitar dahhranggg sound effect on the big bang theory poor raj was left being because everyone else had their hero choice first the character was a real luser when it came to popularity then came justice leaguei hear you can talk to fisheverything changed holey underwear it turns out that is a bad assthis movie delivers on all points is human not just some strange prince namor submariner he likes drinking beer partying with tough guys getting tattoos and hangs with his dad he cracks wise while he cracks heads hes intensely loyal and hes very powerfulvisually its brilliant with incredible action scenes patrick wilson plays an arrogant leader who rules the kingdom of atlantis and has a plan to unite the undersea against the surface dwellers amber heard is the beautiful daughter of an allied kingdom temuera morrison and nicole kidman play arthur currys parents willem dafoe dolph lundgren round out a name cast lead by jason momoa and yes cgi is used and the cgi is extremely effective it gives a dreamlike appearance to underwater sequences which would be impossible to do as practical effectsthe story is top notch it follows a path that at times makes effective use of flashbacks while advancing the plot its very satisfying and concludes heroically yes its a fairy tale ending but what did you expect its a comic booksuperhero movie,fantasy
look i love momoa and im willing to overlook a lot of bad pacingactingsfx for entertainment but this is just an example of hownottomovie nothing makes sense in a bad way nothing is properly explained although the dialogue is 90 exposition there is no reason to be invested in any of the characters who are these people even its just meaningless cool scene after meaningless cool scene with no coherence also the costumes are atrocious who even made all these fake wigs blah expected better,fantasy
this guy is very cool,fantasy
ouch i was really hoping that this was going to be an enjoyable movie however i lost interest after around 20 minutes and then after about an hour i found myself skipping through entire scenesi really dont know how people can possibly rate this movie more than a 5 or a 6 at very best i love superhero movies of all flavors and this one just didnt work  far too much cgi and not enough character or plot developmentgive it a miss and use your bandwidth on something else,fantasy
is this a comedy because i was laughing those 10 mins i spent watching this trash god bless torrents no one really need to waste money for this,fantasy
i think dc make heros film alone beter than group for example justice leag was bad and btaman vs superman was worse film of dc comic but wonder woman or man of steel and is beter than them,fantasy
its a fine film it has all the elements of a superhero movie but it wasnt for me i wont be negative because i didnt really enjoy it much the movie seemed to lack for me that x factor that other movies of this genre have go see it the odds are high that you will enjoy it,fantasy
avatar and now this movie ppl love boring sea movies this movie was horrible,fantasy
although people might compare this to black panther but according to me this movie is 3 times better than black panther loved every single minute of this and damn those visuals were breathtaking sooo good dc did something good hope it gets better and better,fantasy
saw for the first time today on a family with friends outing was expecting khal drogo but throughout the movie jason momoa as won me over and he makes the best that i have ever seen i liked that this movie could appeal to a wide audience kids and friends loved the story and the visual effects action was fun and want to see it again i did see all types of reviews on this movie and did not know what to expect it was amazing and executed wonderfully honestly enjoyed it more than some of the other hero movies that came out previously,fantasy
if movie could give you cancer then you are at right placethis is the worst movie i sawmany stories at same time  nothing happening  no homo  after 2h everything happend in 5 min and endsoooo stupid  overrated  please dont make next part  just dont pleasei lost 2h and 10 min on this movie and it gave me cancer,fantasy
whoever is giving this anything close to a 610 is either working for the film company or 10 years old and excited by the fact they shouldnt be watching it getting a 7410 is simply misleading to peoplethis film is bad in so many ways bad and over used cgi think star wars attack if the clones levels of bad cgi usage the story stinks as do the characters who are all high level hollywood pen pals who look like they have been swimming in botox together its ok to have wrinkles miss kidman it trys to be funny when its not remotely funny at allworst of all had to be the bad guy or one of the bad guys hes on some kind of revenge mission which i actually forgot about until he popped up later in the film hes really really good at pulling mean faces thoughi suggest you watch finding nemo if you are that keen on a sea movie was never going to be able to carry his own film hes even less interesting than the flash,fantasy
ive already dogged the entire dc universe multiple times  now im going to do it again i will admit i was hopeful this film might be fun but then i saw the trailer  then i saw the later  longer extended trailer  one thing i can confirm if youve seen the last extended trailer youve seen the film jason mimosas snarky take and one liners were not born for this character amber heard still cant act  throwing nicole kidman patrick wilson  willem defoe into this heap of garbage is frankly disrespectful to their skill set im honestly at a complete loss of how to save dc i will note i am huge wonder woman  dc fan  had great hopes this universe could be salvaged somehow but honestly i dont think its possible anymore ill hold out that ww1984  joaquins joker will be of interest but 1 billion dollars does make a turd shine no matter how much elbow grease you put into it,fantasy
horrible movie too bad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaad,fantasy
this is hands down a solid reason dc should just roll over and leave it to marveldont get me wrong i grew up reading both sides of comic books and then some but this is just mostly painful im afraidloose plot loose acting at best loose story line and dont even get me started on the amount of goofsway too long for what it really isit actually does have some minor good points for me at least some of the movie really does hold itself together pretty wellbut for the most part ive pretty much forgotten ive watched it already,fantasy
i wanted to like this i mean aqua man is always the butt end of jokes because he really doesnt have much for powers but after watching this it proves once again that marvel is just a step ahead in every way over dc62,fantasy
effects are very weak and artificial especially in fight scenes nicole kidman and father makeup are very bad they wanted to make them young but they messed up funny dialogues are not funny at all fights are boring and too long i slept after an hour and watched the rest of the movie later i dont understand why people liked this movie and gave it 1010,fantasy
sorry my brain shriveled up and cried for the whole 25hrs of this movie the 1010 votes here must be from the popcorn munching teenagers who grew up on this mindless drivel i give it 10 stars for cgi and take 7 away for the pain this movie caused me as a human being jezus hollywood what are you doing,fantasy
ive always wanted to see an movie and finally its here just like with wonder woman i love that they tried to interject some humor into the storyline instead of being overly dark and dramatic,fantasy
 is an amazingly entertaining movie with breathtaking underwater battles and great visual effects my score of the movie on imdb is deliberately set to 10 with the hopes to increase the overall rating of the movie certainly the film is not perfect having some plot holes and some other inconsistencies with the characters this film focuses only on showing origin story combined with amazing battles  and it accomplished its task on a high note some of the other reviewers on imdb mentioned negative aspects such as weak dialogs or rushed character development i believe these aspects are not important for this kind of film one of the main goals is to be entertained and we all are highly entertained is definitely not a characterfocused drama it is instead a fantasy adventure based on the characters from a comic book so taking this into consideration just try to have fun and enjoy the movie,fantasy
jason momoa has easily got to be the most engaging action hero of 2019i guess the comedies like family guy  simpsons and robot chicken are feeling pretty stupid for all of their jokes about how lame is right about now was not supposed to be cool this was so fkn coolthe movie is totally epic 1010 bigger  better than black panther  wonder woman  crazier than wolverine combinedthe dc universe have smashed it out of the park it really felt like they had a 3 movie plan and just said screw it all inamber heard was smoking and dolph lundgren patrick wilson temuera morrison nicole kidman all slayedjames wan take a bow in an era of logan infinity war deadpool and black panther stood very tall,fantasy
miles better than anything that has come out of dc in a long time and even better than my previous favourite thor ragnorak to spectacular visuals particularly in imax3d probably the best film ive seen for utililising this mamoa is excellent and probably the most instantly likeable hero of all time kidman and heard were also fantastic whilst even lundgren whilst unrecognisable puts in some of his better work wilson also performs his role superbly already can not wait for the next instalment and hoping for many many others after this,fantasy
grafics and underwater world are amazing story line is very bad bad jokes and horrible music,fantasy
 is such a blast from start to finish and an epic ride that feels like its on the same level of ambition and scale as avatar i am so happy that james wan got to direct this film because if youve seen furious 7 where the action sequences in that film were extremely wellshot and impressive you wont be disappointed by the fight scenes hereyes the cgi is impressive especially towards the end of the film but i feel that special praise should be given to the incamera fight scenes ie the handtohand combat sequences that involved very minimal to no cgi this is some of the best action in the dc universe on par with zack snyders batman fight and patty jenkins no man land sequencejason momoa is absolutely fantastic and is a lot reserved and sincere in his performance contrary to his reallife persona where hes always wacky and energetic and a bit crazy but here hes fantastic patrick wilson is also great as the villain ocean master and he has a very thrilling and menacing presence in a lot of the films scenes nicole kidman and amber heard were amazing as well in their performances as well as dolph lundgren for heavens sake hes not in it much but he gave a surprisingly good performance and the same can be said for willem dafoe who ever since spiderman ive been a big fan of him as an actorthis feels like an epic fantasy picture and should definitely not be missed if anything it just goes on to show what a talented director james wan is,fantasy
its very difficult to satisfy the world of comics especially james wan truly earned his right to join billion dollar clubcasting was great i was really terrified after hearing that jason mamoa  amber heard is going to lead 200 million dollars project they both stole the show jason is really played arthur character nicely director  writers definitely knows what theyre doing they didnt do like comic book arthur currys character they have created their own version of who is going to lead more future dceu movies mera is beautiful queen and badass heroine my man black manta has definite character development to hate dolph was a big surprise williem dalfoe was perfectly casted as vulko at first time i thought king orm character was under utilised but patrick wilson stole the entire show while i watch this movie for the second time i can see clearly what james and writers did to this character origin of ocean master best thing about in this whole movie is love story between temuera morrison and nicole kidmanoh about music some moments took my breath away just like blade runner  avatar awesome soundtrack for the record dceu movies has awesome soundtracks till now except suicide squad which i dont rememberjames wan admires everything equally story cringy comic stuffs showing earths 70 of underwater atmosphere as real as fantasy atlantis and other kingdoms and importantly global warming issues and embracing the real sea creatures only thing bugged me in this movie is that scoreboard showed just before their gladiator fight some critics complaining about plot shifting pitbull song flashback characters vfx for me those things never bugged medefinitely ive enjoyed this movie more in my second round were in the era of jason bourne action style christopher nolans reality style of fantasy blockbuster fever for past 6 years of mcu  star wars movie which did the job in its own way people have forgot about 80s adventure movies  90s action movies james wan brought that back as epic action packed fantasy adventure movieswitch off your book mind  open your comic book mindyou will sink inside this movie is definitely worth watching with the whole familyoh i forgot to mention thisthis movie is second best imax visual ive seen in big screenps my first one is mi fall out,fantasy
 gooooooooood moive  nive one go a hed,fantasy
james wan rocked itby far the best dceu moviei just hope james is given more movies to directhe had taken the universe on the next level,fantasy
i can not really understand those people who from my point of view very easily threw around those 2s and 3s aroundfirst things first my reasons or expectations when i choose to go along with dc or marvel movies are never about the narrative or the storyline having laid my hands upon a few of these comics in my time i mostly know what they are about they are about those alter hero egos that we have and thanks to ever evolving technology visual effects and to see how the movie team envisioned the settingbecausewell helloooo the stories the character backgrounds archvillians were delivered long time ago aaaand plots over plots have been worked upon already in the comic series this is not a political thriller or mystery movie where you will find stomach churning twists around every corner that will dazzle you in ways you would not expectso what i likedi found to deliver a good job when it is about visuals i very much liked the technological gadgetsvehicles of the atlanteans and specifically enjoyed the underwater scenesvisuals and the daft punk like music that accompanied it which kind of pleasantly reminded me troni also liked the fact that jason momoa was chosen to be the lead actor him being from hawai ascend and a few times in the movie throwing in gestures coming from his culture was neati also liked the scenes with the kraken and how he gets the trident like arthur gets the excalibur or conan his sword it had similar flavours but in a pleasing wayas the villains go i have to say patrick wilson also does a good job as king ormso if you have no prejudice on dc and realistic about what to expect from these movies i say nails it in a rather good way i have to admit one of the best i have seen recently and yes including deadpool 2 or avengers infinity war 1,fantasy
this movie at times was cringeworthy the dialog between actor seems to be written with 5 year olds in mind the cgi was good but at times overdone leaving one to thinkyeah right going into this movie one has to turn off your brain and accept it for what it is to get through it,fantasy
its funny the first review i saw after coming to imdb page was of a guy who says he was so annoyed for people reviewing the movie they watched before he could watch ill never know what he meant by that he repeatedly days he loves dc in his review but any sane person can read through his review he hates on dc im just citing this to tell you people please dont listen to people like him they just want to degrade every other comic book movie thats not part of mcu they even did that that venom which is a marvel character but not in mcu which wasnt tied to mcu which by the way was hugely successful despite these miscreants badmouthing the movie people are getting the fact that even so called critics are useless they also have a bias that they cant just take their word for it if you want to know how good a movie is ask around the people you know who have watched it my honest opinion on film is i went to without a lot of hope because james wans any of previous films werent cbms i wasnt sure well he be able to pull it i wasnt much excited too i only went and watched it because it was a dc movie yep i love dc more im not gonna lie  but i was really surprised by what james wan had to offer with it had an amazing pacing to the story no lag or what so ever what we saw it trailers is nothing compared to actual movie visuals were amazing its something thats unique its made in a grand scale if youre gonna watch it  it better be on the biggest screen you can find if you dont its your loss youll know when you watch it on dvd or bluray that damn i shouldve watched it in theatresmy review is applicable only to general audiences who enjoys movies for their quality but their brandcertain fanboys will disagree with it because they dont like good competition,fantasy
i found this movie to be rather predictable and filled with swear words and i do mean filled if i was a masochist i would see it again and count them at least marvel knows their audience and limits the use of profanity i watched thor ragnarok and counted 3 total swear words i will be very careful before i take my grandchildren to see a dc movie,fantasy
ok im not gonna say it the most gripping and realistic superhero movie ive ever seen but if your like me and really enjoy lots of good fight and action sequences mixed with some comical and even touching moments then is for you however something about this movie and especially jason momoas character just makes me wanna watch this movie again and i just left the theater he brings a real and authentic feel to this hero that you can relate to i hands down fully feel this is without a doubt one of if not the best film ive seen all year go see it now,fantasy
best dc movie ever i can watch it like 4ever the actors and the action is amazing and unbelievable,fantasy
i mean its fun im glad they made it fun but christ the genre changes with every new scene i think people like this movie because it does everything  every cliche every movie genre every visual and audio choice possible im pretty sure people are just so overwhelmed and they remember snippets of the things they like and are immediately concussed by everything else cause theres so god damn much so they just walk out of the cinema in a daze cause it isnt humanly possible to accept this movie in one sitting the biggest thing was the cringey dialogue really put me off the character development cause i couldnt accept a real human being would talk like they did in this movie its jarring to say the least but jason as was a really great choice and im glad he was in it im numb to everyone else its worth seeing if you like fun and if you can stand the romantic comedy movie genre if not this movie will just be cringey i liked it but wont be seeing it again,fantasy
this moovie should be watched only in 3d preferebly in imax all bad reviews are written by people who watched the cinema on their laptops visual effects are stunning i have waited for a decent visual effects after avatar and here is the moovie that is similar or even better by visual effects are you missing pandora then go to imax and watch it in 3d,fantasy
i loved every single minute of non stop exciting special effects with a great story line good character development and back story telling,fantasy
neither cool underwater effects nor jason mamoas unbridled enthusiasm can save this flick at times bad greenscreen poorly timedwritten exposition crappy songs pointless fight scenes  too much plot drowns this overlong mixed bag,fantasy
i continue to watch dc films with the hope that some day they will develop movies of the standard of marvel sadly i fear that day will never arrive not only do dc continuously have bad scripts but the story is weak is better than most mainly due to the lead actor mamoa however the script and story base is still poor from an adult perspective although youngsters may love it,fantasy
jason made for some good eye candy though and heards character had a few impressive stuntsbut overall really boring constantly forcing a punch first ask questions later mentality into which didnt really feel very naturalalso can we stop the obligatory straight romance side plot its getting old,fantasy
this is a 11 rate movie perfect movie i love everything in this movie,fantasy
stunning special effects a delightful story and at his bestmale and female characters working together no one overlapping just for gender issues mera is super and carries her own weight throughout the movie is trained and thus we believe that he can do all those amazing things and the villains feel like they can tip the scale to their favor and win at any given moment super movie  go and see it ,fantasy
i honestly dislike most dc films then wonder woman came out and i was impressed this ranked right up up there with it great film great acting story visuals and so much more dont let the critics on here fool you its worth a watch if you are into hero movies i cant wait to see what more dc films have to show us,fantasy
dc is apparently getting better at this whole family enjoyed this from beginning to end,fantasy
to be honest i have never read the comics for but honestly this is what us french canadians call a crote which pretty much means mediocre after seeing so many super hero movies btw i really dont care if its dc or marvel i dont know what the fanboyism is about i just want a good movie and actually movies in general i had some pretty low though expectations but this this was horrible the plot was extremely flawed i wont spoil it but if you watch it you might know what i mean from the very beginning of the movie and some elements just not making any form of sense with previous events also the acting was at its worse seriously ive seen better acting from secondary school students doing a forced movie project by an english teacher everything the characters said was so emotionless and directly recited that it was cheesy and outright seemed unprofessional which stunned me coming from such a large studio with some usually very good actors the most dramatic moments were so badly interpreted that they were funny even if you do like the story assuming you have read the comics you probably will be shocked by the low quality of the acting and the cgi oh boy the cgi when i watched it i had the constant feeling that i was watching some cheesy mr clean commercial from the mid2000s the movie revolves around cgi pretty much half the movie happens underwater so obviously and does a very poor job at it however even if pretty much 90 if the movie was terrible the fight choreographies are decent and if you like very classic movies or are with a kid you might end up enjoying it i was with my father who was a huge fan of the comics when i watched the movie and even though was one of his favorite super heroes he thought the same as me to sum it up i absolutely do not recommend going to the theater to watch it but i suggest to consider watching it when its going to be available on streaming platforms if you want to laugh at the movie a bit or to watch some underwater fights,fantasy
anyone who rated this movie less than a 7 just wants to bicker i thought it was great right up there with wonder woman if not better jason momoa doesnt disappoint and the action is none stop some of the scenes had the theater in awe great mixture of comedy drama and action definitely one of the best of the dc movies,fantasy
i just dont get why this is rated so highly its ridiculously cheesy makes so many cringeworthy one liners it tries to be funny on so many occasions but falls short the music is repetitive and it is ridiculously cliched the graphics werent amazing it is now where near as good as woman woman i just cant believe it is scores so high on here when there are so many other quality comic book films out there to compare it to,fantasy
the new comics have been fantastic and this movie plays off of the new line of comics that is also the downside to this movie  it feels like a string of comics smashed together it was missing a solid overarching thread to keep everything pieced together it also felt like they missed out on some scenes that really would have added some depth if they lingered on them a bit more but instead they raced to the next action scene i think they wanted to keep things moving but they missed out on some major scenes to connect with the characters there was a heavy use of cgi in this movie as is common with dc movies but it was definitely blended better and not as much was used as has been the case in previous dc movies it was better put together than many recent marvel movies which are beginning to just feel like cliche michael bay films id rate all recent marvel movies between 47 out of 10 stars for perspective,fantasy
thoroughly enjoyable visually captivating and well executed,fantasy
this movie was excellent it was full of action and a little romance it had a hint of comedy i highly recommend this movie to any one please go see,fantasy
dc ready to rock best vfx good story linebest vfz movie i ever seen,fantasy
 is just purely a great time  the special effects in this movie are some of the best i have ever seen  the fighting is on another level  the flow of the movie just keeps you thoroughly entertained the whole time  this is definitely a must watch  i loved it ,fantasy
ive always had a soft spot for and this movie was pretty much what i expected it to be stunning visuals with a mediocre scripta lot of the dialogue between arthur and mera was so disconnected which made it hard to believe there was any sort of genuine connection between them as cheesy as the rest of it was it strangely worked and felt consistentthe soundtrack was decent except for the random pittbull track yes thats right pitbull which set up the following scene to be more jovial than it should have beenblack manta was a great concept but yahyas performance left me wanting more dialogue and less soap opera dramatizationoverall the film was fun full of stunning battle scenes and seeing jason momoa in the old school getup was well worth every second,fantasy
while not perfect i would put this one at the top of the dceu alongside wonder woman 2017 an underwater story of king arthur borrowing elements from thor 2011  black panther 2018 that brings us an entertaining adaptation of the new 52 storyline by geoff johns  ivan reis its impressive how much atlantean history they were able to include without bogging down the narrative the underwater sequences are really impressive with the scale of this aquatic world brought to life with nearly every bit of the film shot in imax the acting was fine although the stiff  expository dialogue made it obvious how much they are banking on the foreign market for this film the cgi is well done but it still suffers from some shoddy green screen work that seem to plague the dceu the score by rupert gregsonwilliams stands shoulder to shoulder with his work on wonder woman but some of the soundtrack choices are distracting all in all an impressive entry from dc films  a fun super hero flick,fantasy
i loved the movie dont get me wrong it was a thrill ride however the lack of script development was unfortunate i also have to note that some of the musical selections were glaringly out of place bright spots were scenes between and his father because i actually felt history and deep connection between the characters that resonated in me momoa has a way with improvisational speech that works to anchor the bad script but everyone else seemed to be reading sparsely populated cue cards lots of eyerolling cliches all over the place meanwhile the action and visuals were spectacular including one breathtaking scene of extreme peril near the end of the second act of the film there was plenty of fun and funny moments and even the cartoony stuff was on the good side of ridiculous so yeah 710 because the movie does its job in the superhero sphere bringing some camp some heart and some awesome visuals but can we sprinkle some whedon dust on the next installment please i have a feeling he can craft the more complicated dialogue that should have been explored in this origin storyi saw this on imax i highly recommend watching this film on imax,fantasy
all i can say is jason momoa was hot but the movie was not,fantasy
every part of this movie besides the cast was awful  the writing was cheesy and sub par the ocean cgi was cheap the music and plot was predictable and plastic this movie was so bad that if it were worse it would be better,fantasy
it was better when vinnie chase was the lead and with james cameron directing,fantasy
am wondering how are only main characters can breath outside water while others cant,fantasy
before seeing i kept in mind dcs track recordand despite all its flaws its a fun movie just dont set your expectations too high yes lack of character development and predictability were always present which was an obvious disappointment as far as really being able to get engrossed in the actual story and characters themselves however jason momoa delivered and yes the special effects were amazing definitely one of dcs better movies giving a 10 is absolutely a stretch and a1 is a bit brutal its definitely entertaining and the effects themselves is worth the watch if youre going to see it be prepared to be entertained but sorry dc not blown away,fantasy
these movies have been created very well the use of special effects is good you can say that marvel has got a good competitor,fantasy
i cant say its a great movie but jason momoa looks the part and hes quite funny as well theres a little something here for everyone and its certainly different from most other films for once i would recommend imax and if mr momoa thinks he can go off his diet hes mistaken theres definitelya2 on the horizon,fantasy
this move is clear a prove that hollywood superheros movies are in deep crisis is like there are no more fresh ideas so in this film they stole the main argument of king arthur legend they put some flying robots like iron man and some kind of star wars troopers too the main big monster was like a godzilla inserted in a scenario of return to the center of earth it is totally ridiculous to see all this combination on this film but at least its fun,fantasy
 was always one of my favorite comic books as a kid i so wanted it to be great but i found this one to under utilize the potential of jason momoa and patrick wilsonthe good stuff beautifully visualized underwater universe gorgeous colors and interesting use of sea creatures cool cgi effects kids will love thatthe not so good lazy dialogue uninspired score and most melodramatic villain weve seen well since justice league patrick wilson is a stellar actor and even he couldnt quite elevate the character of king orm beyond a dundunduh villain i had really hoped for some great smart aleck comedy from arthur but his character seemed too overwhelmed to deliver on thatat first i thought it was just me but my teen son ie the fan base was bored sorry dc this one was not on par with wonder woman as an origin story in my view,fantasy
the number of cringeworthy scenes in this movie is astonishing but then again it is dc i was crying laughing when amber heard played that little wooden flute on the boat though,fantasy
background story explained well without the long drawn out process it was quick but effective visual imagery was stunning and the battle scenes exhilirating exciting times for dc,fantasy
the plot was terrible was there anything unexpected nothere were two female characters one was mother of the main character and one was the love interestthere were two black characters both evil and one died at the begginingdoes dc know how physics works apparently notalso nobody died i mean it would have been fine but when a mortal human falls down and crashes into three different cliffs they cant just survive that im not even going to talk about jumping out of the plane to a desertoverall it was just not interesting and terribly made the only good thing was the design and originality of creatures,fantasy
better than the majority of marvel movies by far slightly predictable in places best cgi acting and storyline out of any superhero movie i have ever seen 1010 would recommend,fantasy
it had its plot holes it had too much cg too much indeed some unnecessary cheesy lines a few but then again was it what a super hero movie should be yes yes yesone negative no cameo from the justice league trinity unless it had a second post credit scene,fantasy
although black manta was not handled well the family issues kept me interested cinematography and visual effects are spectacular with a predictable yet intriguing plot and strong performances from momoa and heard you wont regret seeing this film,fantasy
loved every scene n moments throughout visually stunning with exc fight sequences must watch,fantasy
james wan director extrodinare of the saw movies goes beyond cutting up here in an adaption of which would make its creators proud if they can see it rip a lot of people worked on this film done in 12 filming locations and that shows very much in the finished product it sticks with original themes and characters and manages to get some humor into the film this is the best warnerdc effort in a whileit works well because the script is better than a lot of dc films have been recently it is predictable all the way to the sequel sequence during the credits but it is going to take some extra effort to make a better film than this one it does have the one drawback many cgi movies have no matter how much dirt there is in a sequence the stars always come out squeaky clean with even a hair out of placenicole kidman age 51 are you kidding is very good as the queen of atlantis amber heard is the red haired princess who helps the light house keepers son become the hero we are all in need of the thing good about this film is that there are no wrinkles or curves thrown at the viewer the flashbacks make sense for once and all the script makes sense toomajor spoilerwe all expect the queen to still be alive even after we are told she is not finally finds his mom and it is a satisfying moment in this one after all moms treat their hero sons the best,fantasy
good movie its long but i appreciated all the content good acting and being a dc movie i expected it to be pretty fantasy looking but the animation was a bit too much,fantasy
this is one of the best dceu films ive seen but i dont think its yet to be saved this film has a really good action scene in the middle of the film with the chase sequence which is a highlight but there is good cinematography in this aswell which is always a good thing in the dceu apart from suicide squad and justice league so thats what i have i guess its good and you should all watch it,fantasy
well done dc i really enjoyed this one my daughter bought us tickets to see she knew i was curious and wanted to see it from beginning to end i can say i was completely immersed in the story good story too never a dull moment this movie is really about family its about doing the right thing for the right reasons arthur doesnt really want to get involved with the problems of the world on land or in the ocean especially at first and thats what makes it more interesting the lead actor does a great job at portraying mera is fantastic as is orm and also atlanna all the cast does a great job in my opinion  they seem to be enjoying themselves and that shows through the screen the underwater world is amazing they did a lot of good stuff with the story development there  and i want to know more about itpros characters story acting fun visuals music was great heroismcons not much for mesee it for yourself and decide i want to see it again soon,fantasy
ill be honest had this movie came out a few years ago before we started getting a superhero movie what seems like every 4 months id have given it an 8 or 9 its got a good plot good acting and cgi fun to watch but its really just more of the same which is why i went with a 710 it did feel a bit long but id recommend it,fantasy
when i went to see this movie i had rather low expectations its a dc cinematic universe movie and there are a bunch noteworthy for being terrible suicide squad was bad and batman vs superman and justice league were major letdowns but i enjoyed myself this time the movie had great visuals its funny interesting and definitely not boring i recommend this to action film fans not just dc fans,fantasy
this review might be a little biased since i love all things nerdy however i can say for sure that this movie was surprisingly great i prefer dc to marvel in terms of characters and comics but its obvious that marvel is the king of superhero movies i actually hated justice league even though its my favorite team of heroes comicwise i enjoyed wonder woman a lot despite its pretty awful 3rd act and i think it is the best dceu movie yetuntil is a goofy movie theres no denying dont go in expecting a movie like the great infinity war that is mostly serious and dire no knows that it is pretty silly and thats what makes it excel the overthetop visuals fights and overall scenes make the movie seem straight out of a comic book at times and i loved it though i could see how hardcore mcu fans wontthe fight scenes with the amazing directing by james wan are the best ive seen in a superhero movie so far they are well choreographed and have a good use of slowmo shots that make it seen very theatrical and utterly badassthe plot is pretty straightforward but had some spots where its not super clear whats supposed to be happening also it was a little too cliche the chosen one going to find an ancient artifact in order to take his place as king to unite the people pretty sure weve seen or read it a thousand times but thats whyit worksthe only flaw in my opinion is the dialogue the acting was pretty top notch ive never been too much of a jason mamoa fan bc i always thought he acted through gruff an brute strength instead of emotion but this movie proved me wrong he did really great with this role and it helps that it seems the role was fit around him the beautiful amber heard did really great as well and i really loved her character i thought orm was going to be cringy and awful going in but i was actually convinced of his acting and motivations in the movie tamuera morrison will always be jango fett in my book so no real complaints there so even though most actors did a great job delivering their lines the dialogue could be pretty weak and very cheesey at times some were bad enough to break the immersion and make me look at my girlfriend and laugheven with all of these flaws i had more fun watching than i have in a suprhero movie and a long long time ca civil war and infinity war are definantly my favorite superhero movies but theyre not necessarily fun to watchmore engaging and emotional than anything kind of like solo being compared to revenge of the sith i was never bored watching bc there was always some action taking placeend notes black manta was awesome and i cant wait to see him again in the next movie and when came out with his new suit that scene not only gave me huge goosebumps but ranked up to the top 10 moments in cinematic history for me,fantasy
best superhero movie ive seen best dc movie and better than the marvel franchise great story great ending great special effects only read it got a 9 was because of the swearing still overall a great movie that i would watch many more times,fantasy
predictible sarcastic commentsdialogues characters lacked depthbut good visuals although sometimes it was weird seeing atlantis with star wars technologies,fantasy
this is by far the best dceu movie to date theres action throughout the movie and a few laughs along the way james wan did a terrific job the conjuring was a masterpiece but this just proves he can direct a epic superhero movie if you can make sure you see it in imax or dolby or anything like that makes a huge difference highly recommend ,fantasy
dc movies have disappointed me so far the justice league movies even wonder women werent that exciting and despite its flaws james wans is one fun ride its a beautiful movie  i mean literally the cinamatography is fantastic  beautifully shot background score is good and the action scenes are really well made james wan as always brings something new to the action scenes interesting camera moves and angles the only flaw is that the emotional aspect is a hit or miss at times and felt a bit rushed early scenes does not give an emotional connection to the love of s parents and the love between and meera also seems a bit rushed but those are the minor flawsjason mamoa is great as overall a decent movie and a real fun time in this festive season,fantasy
 is the sixth installment in the dc extended universe starring jason momoa in the title role it proves that dc films are experiencing a resurgence and will likely prove to be healthy competition with marvelone year after the events of justice league arthur curry jason momoa learns he is heir to the throne of atlantis an underwater kingdom populated by sea life and humanoid lifeforms known as the atlanteans however arthurs place as king is challenged by his half brother orm patrick wilson who intends to invade the surface world and reclaim it back for the ocean being halfhuman and halfatlantean arthur must try to stop orm from succeeding in his genocidal plan and give atlantis the ruler it deserveshigh spirited and likeable thankfully gives the dc extended universe the much needed push it has needed for some time similar to how wonder woman did in 2017 there is a comfortable balance between comic relief and serious drama but never so much that it feels like it is ripping off or downright plagiarising its style from marvel in terms of plot the film feels like a hybrid of thor and black panther and its only major issue is that the story occasionally becomes muddled in its exposition scenes which does affect the pacing at times jason momoa is without a doubt the perfect actor to play the titular hero as he effectively elevates the character beyond being the laughing stock he has been among comic book fans for many decades his scenes with mera amber heard were great fun to watch and were the source of some of the films more lighthearted moments willem dafoe was also used well and wasnt merely reduced to being a cameo and in addition to this it was quite unusual to see him play a good guy in a comic book film be sure to stay back for an important midcredits bonus scenei rate it 7510,fantasy
the movie is a visual spactale it is definitely better than the other dc movies barring wonder woman jason momoa is very good and lives up to the stature of being the blunt instrument the movie takes some time to build and then hurriedly sprints towards the end the action sequences are amazing and james wan did a good job in the directors chair overall it doesnt suck and it is a fun movie to watch,fantasy
there was 30 minutes of a fantastic movie in between needless conversation dragged on far too long with boredom setting in far too soon,fantasy
all of the under water scenes are just amazing and very interesting story and cool villans,fantasy
some of the humor dont land but its action packed and very story driven,fantasy
 deserves a 10 star by itself already watched twice in imax yes please go watch imax version it is beautiful from the scene song story pace and the imagination the performance  everything you can see james signature surprising moment from time to timei give a 9 star simply because i believe there is more james can offer and please let him do it,fantasy
its like hiring a professional to fix the brakes on your car you get your car back smelling like lavender and covered in glitter but the brakes dont work and the mechanic couldnt be happier,fantasy
went in with low expectations but walked out loving it great action great visual affects and great storytelling im ready for 2,fantasy
i was always a dceu fan and actually enjoyed batman v superman and justice league so i had high expectations for after watching it i can say i was fully entertained dc movies were always great on spectacle and this was no exception in even managed to create a new world that could be enough to make a franchise in its own right with james wan at the helm this movie does not feel like a dc movie it is not moody nor mopey and had lots of fun the sea creatures were great and the underwater world was breathtaking jason momoa proved he could carry a movie despite his hulking presence and badass look momoas is a quite a character he is charming witty and persevering but he is not broody like batman or superman nor is he a doeeyed idealist as wonder woman during wwi he is a relatable character who just happens to have superpowers besides momoa patrick wilson was excellent as a villain unlike previous dc villains he is interesting and proves a worthy nemesis to momoas though his performance is not as compelling as michael b jordans killmonger we can still see understand his characters motive as for other supporting casts dolph lundgren stole the show he chews every scenery he is in that is not to say amber heard and willem defoe were terrible but i just enjoyed lundgren more in the end is a superhero movie done right and does not aim to be oscar material a great piece of fun entertainment,fantasy
hats off to james wan for bringing to life one of dc greatest superhero the acting cgi character progress cinematography score are amazing seeing the suit for the first time give me the goosebumps and mera is hotjust ignore the critics or anyone that said this movie is boring go see and experience it yourself,fantasy

really great spectaclefun ride jason momoa has great comedic timinggreat supporting castpatrick wilson plays a great villain in his comeback role dc baby,fantasy
 this isfascinating on of the best dc movies ever madecontains a lot of action and the visual effects are astonishing voila,fantasy
yeah it was good but not good enough lol wonder woman still champion for dc and marvel still champion of the movies,fantasy
i like this movie the acting was superb and jason momoa is the perfect however the movie dragged on and on i cant help but feel this couldve been condensed into an hour and a half i will say its the best dc comics movie made since the original batman with michael keaton wonder wonan wasnt bad though,fantasy
now i really believe those critics are so biased to dc films it got only 64 on rt while thor got 77 and antman and the wrap a 88 mindblowing haha the first antman is really good though  jesus that is so wrongi have tried to look at those reviews with different opinion and sorry they are just laughable to methis is no doubt one of the best superhero movie i have ever seem it really deserve more recognition than it already had,fantasy
beautiful movie a magical world created by hardworking artists animators and visionariesloved the touch of humor epic action sequences and well executed time jumps to tell the storygreat message hope people really hear it,fantasy
this is a treat to your eyes woow just woow amazing vfx showdown and the story and action keeps you gripped to your seats nowhere in the movie i felt bored thanks to the action sequences and gorgeous amber heard i like the fact that they have shown her strong and have given her good amount of action cgis scenes and is not just a one man show by ending couldve been better i felt but no worries ill buy it for now good job and thanks for this spectacular,fantasy
after avatar this movie had the similar best visual effect,fantasy
i dont like marvel fans writing reviews just so dc will look bad i am a dc fan but i also like marvel movies too and they are great for entertainingthis movie is one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen the difference between this one and the rest of the superhero movies most of the actions are underwatercgi so it makes more difficult to do cgis but i have to say they did a great job on therethe only critic would be where the hell jl were while all these happening ,fantasy
i usually dont compare films but with comparison with both wonder woman and thor yields interesting thoughts first however is a recap of the plotlinethe story of our halfhuman halfatlantean protagonist is introduced through firstperson vo starting with the story of his parents and bookended in the same way for full closure the tale is familiar atlanna nicole kidman tobe queen of one of the seven kingdoms of atlantis fell in love with lighthouse keeper tom curry temuera morrison and gave birth to arthur jason momoa when grown up domesticity bliss alas was shortlived as she was soon found and commanded to return to consummate the marriage to save the life of her husband and son she did and bore the king a son orm patrick wilson when grown up atlanna the audience is made to understand was put to death after fulfilling her mission of bringing an heir to the kingdom in the meantime good guy the councilor vulko willem dafoe with first loyalty to the queen secretly mentored arthur developing everything he needed to be an atlantis royaltybrought up on land but with the other half of his identity secretly nurtured by vulko arthur has a personality that is nowhere near to royalty as he occasionally performs some heroic deeds such as rescuing the crew of a pirated soviet submarine but on the whole he is just an average funloving muscular guy until a dazzling redhead appears in his life she is mera amber heard a princess in one of the atlantis kingdoms a crisis is brewing underwater as the various monarchs and leaders vie for control of all the kingdoms as a prelude to taking on the world on the land surface it seems that arthur similar to his namesake in camelot is the one who is truly capable of this supreme leadership for peace not war there is even an excaliburlookalike scene towards the end of the moviearthur needless to say wants nothing to do with this nonsense but when circumstances make him owe mera for saving his fathers life he has to humor her then meeting vulko upon arriving at atlantis he begins to see the situation more clearly following tradition he challenges his younger halfbrother now king orm and losses wielding their fathers the deceased king trident orm breaks arthurs trident inherited from their mother atlanna mera saves arthurs life but at a cost of losing everything herself because she is in fact betrothed to ormthe next sequence is also very familiar hero and heroine on a quest in search of the legendary trident that only a true king can lay claim on the parallel trajectory is also familiar  consistent bickering blossoms into romance the rest is paint by number with a twist that you will not see coming only if you have watch less than five movies your entire lifethere is a subplot in the aforementioned rescue mission leaves a fatherandson pair of pirates to die in a sinking submarine the fathers selfsacrifice saves the son who becomes black manta yahya abdulmateen ii the secondary villain in this movie he is vanquished by midway through the movie but survives and appears again in the postcredit teaser likely to become one of the villains maybe even the lead villain in the sequelnow to the comparisons while atlantis is underwater and the islands of themyscira are not both and wonder woman have a heritage of an alien world that is however still on earth the marked difference is that while is brought up on our world wonder woman is not cultural difference whether in real world or in fantasies has always been good fodder for levity in movies in wonder womans case she is herself the direct object as in her shopping scenes when she first set foot on london with this role of being the subject of levity is given to mera while he has the role of an earthman enlightening her good examples are aplenty such as using 6 oclock to indicate direction a concept which is entirely alien to mera another example is the reference to pinocchio when they hide in the belly of a whale the significance only comes to light to mera in a later scene when she stumbles across a copy the childrens novelwith thor the comparison is obviously sibling rivalry but with marked differences thor is true blue royalty while loki is not even blood sibling on the other hand is only half atlantis purely from a logical angle orm has a more legitimate claim another interesting thing is that the persona of the two younger brothers are widely different loki is the god of mischief and that says it all orm on the other hand is not only all seriousness but also projects a classic and composed image neither of course is the stereotype villain we usually encounter in this genre is arguably the most spectacular rendition of a superhero story on screen the set pieces take full advantage of unique underwater environ but then one scene may make you for a second think that you are watching planet tatooine star wars or the trailer of dune filming as a matter of fact wouldnt be started until 2019 the best set piece however is on land in a picturesque sicilian seaside village marriage of best action and best scenerymomoa with cool posing and jawdropping moves is a credit to the comic character he is recreating recreating because the original dc in the comic book looks very different heard complements him well kidman elevates the otherwise runofthemill scenes to fitting emotional levels defoe handles with professional ease his paycheck role as opposed to his role in florida project last year that was oscar caliber,fantasy
i love orm hahaha its the first time the villain has all spies from hero,fantasy
i went to support and watch jason momoa i ended up enjoying a movie for a big fan of momoa i barely noticed him caught up in the glory and lights of this movie the emotion caught me and got me involved and as a writer for once it didnt feel like i knew where it was going after having watched many superhero movies with basically the same storyline this one felt fresh and attention keeping i loved how they took time to build all the characters and didnt just give them minuscule reason for fighting also that the main antagonists shared moments of grat emotion being half brothers i was heavily entertained and believe jason momoas take on will forever remain the one to beat and the one to reach he did a fantastic job and ive never seen such perfect acting he managed the impossible drew me away from his visage into a story,fantasy
anyone who is working positive reviews is either lying or has brain damage this is the worst comic movie ever worse than green lantern 010 if i could unwatch this i would i dont even want to get into details because im trying to forget this like of garbage the best part is leaving the theater and taking about how bad it is jesus christ how do you mess up this badly,fantasy
well directed and edited movie paying respect to the movie goer forking out hard earned cash enthralling storyline and good characterization makes this a must watch holiday movie and a must must watch superhero moviemovie has a good balance of humor seriousness and reminders of the futility of war and human consumption waste  we are over polluting the oceanssuperb performances allround with standout performances from kidman and heard nicole kidman was a fantastic as the mother of she would have made a much better pepper pottsvisually the movie is best in imax 2d nor 3d does justice to the special effectssome of the fight scenes are horribly violent so obey the picture ratingmovie has scenes that reminds one of pacific rim star wars indiana jones and the game halolastly to raj from the big bang theory  does not suck,fantasy
not the best movie though it is cheesy here and there the story has plenty of plotholes however the pace the action the dialogues the overall experience that this movie provides is top notch probably the most entertaining movie of 2018 sorry infinity war,fantasy
is a great movie the action was amazing and the chemistry between arthur  mera was great loved the fighting sequences and cant wait to see it again,fantasy
i liked this movie i felt the actioni kept things interesting as is par for these types of movies you dont go see an for a compelling story i felt the pacing was good too i wasnt bored really the fight and chase sequences were well shot it was bit cheesy at times predictable violence was kept in check the intro to manta could have been more compelling but it fit within the pacing of the movie for you ladies you have plent of shirtless scenes with mr to fantasize about and for us guys two wordamber heard this lady just oozed the sexuality wet or dry her face and body are just flawless great movie great eye candy soso story line and did i mentionamber heard,fantasy
this film takes us on an epic adventure to an unexplored dimension wan did an incredible job directing this film dc definitely has one on the board with this one great job by the actors also,fantasy
action as usual in a sauce of mystical sea creatures not sure if it has been better more fun or more serious style somewhere in between nowgood all scenes with nicole kidman all scenes with redhead amber heard fighting in sicilia,fantasy
see on the biggest screen possible as its absolutely stunning to watch breathtaking in every sense of the word it also has a heart a very charismatic jason momoa in the lead a great supporting cast nicole kidman rocks in her limited screen time and an amazing soundtrackdont listen to the stuffy negative reviews this is an movie so just have fun with it i was grinning most of the way through its sweeping 2hr 22min runtime if you grew up like me loving the original star wars trilogy indiana jones and christopher reeves superman then youll appreciate what james wan has deliveredi definitely look forward to spending more time in the ocean at a future date bring on 2,fantasy
its not easy to write a story with a character like and be able to make it look good not be a silly mess and to be serious enough to engage peopledc really came back and did a great job with this movie they didnt inject any political junk it was wellpaced and acted the story was good the effects were greatim a marvel fan mostly but i love the dc characters as well and it made me happy to see dc put out something so entertaining i really hope they can keep it up because they have so many awesome characters that need movies that do them justiceamber heard did great even she would have been a better choice for captain marvel imoi give this a solid 7510 with no real complaints,fantasy
amber heard turns out to be hottest girl in dceu with charismatic performance jason momoa in did not do justice to the character in jl a light hearted character was destroyed visuals were amazing 3d element was on pars dialogues did miss the element of surprise and turned out to be too predictable william dafoes return to superhero genre was well potrayed james wan made this the best dc movie with fun and excitement on the heap throughout the movie although some parts of the movie did seperate the entire movie out of the dceu,fantasy
after all the depressing and dark dc films lately its a refreshing breath of air to see a superhero film that is both inspiring and fun to watch the film is visually spectacular without all the drab scenery and dark lighting some previous dc films have relied on just like after seeing wonder woman this film has you leaving the cinema feeling entertained enthusiastic and hungry for more superhero asswhooping,fantasy
wonder woman was the best now is the best movie from dc,fantasy
ive been waiting for this film ever since it was announced because i originally like and because i was curious about what was expected to be an interesting version of him and the film didnt let me downfor context my favorite modern super hero movies so far were wonder woman thor ragnarok and black panther if that illustrates my tastesvisually its a treat in every way the cinematography the underwater world the action the striking beauty of jason and amber this movie is absolute eye candyi liked the acting manta was on point even if he was a bit underutilized but i can understand because hed be well set up for a sequel and it doesnt get too crammed since you have orm as the main antagonist rather than trying to showcase both manta and orm and falling short or getting bogged down manta becomes an anticipated part of the sequel were surely getting orm also was well played although i have to disclose bias ive had a crush on patrick wilson for years that said i think he did a good job he had a couple lines that were kinda iffy but he pulls them off and his scene after the final fight with arthur is very movingmera does not disappoint shes an awesome character and shes well serviced by this film and as a fan of the arthurmera ship im happy shes not sidelined in the plot and action but also the romantic aspect is not shoved in your facearthur is trapped between wanting to help people and refusing fo be king he just wants to save he world thats all hes understandably reluctant to go for the crown but his journey being pressured by dangerous circumstances and accepting his responsibility was beautiful to witnessplot wise i was expecting the impending threat of an attack on the surface the dead father revenge the brothers showdown because as much as i avoid trailers it was kinda hard to miss completely but i was shocked when the trench dwellers appeared i was on the edge of my seat because im a scaredy cat and the trench gives me the creepsis this the exact arthur from the comics no but its a damn good one and theres room in my heart for all,fantasy
im so glade dc might have a take and raise up this movie was not a disappointment absolutely worth watching i got to see a an early screening for sure will be going to see it in imax 3d had the best visuals so far in the dceu,fantasy
nowadays super heros are being popular than real heros is another instalment from the line this is from dc house and seems to be popular like marvel studios characters it is a good movie for adventure lovers jason momoa is perfect casting for his towering height 64 and muscled body gave a real look to this new under water super hero other casting like of nicole kidman willem dafoe amber heard and dolph lundgren is okay amber heard looks slim and a little dull than previous and having dimmer charm dolph lundren is lost in his makeup i actually did not recognize him for a while story is as required by an adventurous plot for comics however photography is super various kingdoms like desert kingdom atlantis kingdom and other are amazing their sets are fantastic and filling real good you will definitely enjoy from watching brilliantly portrayed those kingdoms though this is comical story for children it is also watchable for parents also with their kidsi impressed to see a scene where an octopus is drumming with his all hands how a unique idea it surely will take you to notice this highlighted part of the movemy recommendation is just go and watch no read any review further it is full of enjoyment,fantasy
before you call me a dceu fanboy you should know that i hate suicide squad and found justice league incredibly disappointing a dceu fanboy would think that all six dceu movies are masterpieces that being said i have loved the other dceu movies and i am not a fan of the mcu i find most of their movies bland obnoxious superficial and soulless on the other hand is none of those things it has heart a good arc for the main character its villains have a little more depth than most mcu villains its vfxmusic and cinematography are easily superior to every mcu movie the soundtrack is easily one of the best of the year amber heard and jason momoa have great chemistry and the supporting cast are all memorable the best part about this movie is that while it does have humor it never cuts into the emotional moments like wonder woman before it is sincere and allows its drama and action scenes to play out without every character cracking jokes every five seconds another thing does well is that it gives its villains plenty of screen time the movie isnt perfect its pacing is a little messy and its story is predictable but it commits to its tone and because of that it works i think that the anti dceu bias is obvious considering that it has far worse reviews than most mcu movies the vfx alone would make this a better movie than black panther but the likable characters good actingproduction design music directing and tone make this the second best live action superhero movie of 2018 behind deadpool 2 in a fair world would receive oscar nominations for vfx score production design sound mixing and sound editing in reality it will receive none of these things while black panther which had horrible vfx and sound design will receive tons of technical nominations and even a best picture nomination oh and my review will receive tons of down votes because mcu fanboys cant handle the idea of dc even trying to compete,fantasy
dc comics finally put out a movie worth watching with all the stunning visual effects you would only expect from marvel this film was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish and even brought a tear to my eye at the end good job dc,fantasy
simply fantastic the movie makes you understand the origin of the superhero has evolution has music has photography has history  best dc movie of all time congratulations ,fantasy
this movie is so good the best of the dc universe by far id like the storyline and the special effects everything on is entertaining,fantasy
if youre just looking for a movie in which you can sit back relax and just watch a fun action film with beautiful graphics then is that film its wellshot perhaps the biggest scope of scenes and locations ive seen in a superhero film lately its lively tone and layered action scenes wont leave you bored with its swift pacingotherwise its by no means perfect the film is your standard superhero narrative with not much changes to the formula other than some ties to adventure genre its mood is quirky and character motivations seem onedimensional watch it if you just want to not think too much about the film and see something fun,fantasy
redemption thats how to describe this film doesnt follow down the dark path that films like batman v superman and suicide squad did and failed miserably and goes on to deliver what films are supposed to be in the first place entertainament has all the ingredients to be not just the best dceu film in the lot but to be one of the best superhero films in the genrejason momoa plays wonderfully even if the script can get spicy at times with his lines he dominates the screen and is a joy to watchhis sidekick mera played by amber heard is a memorable and gracious character to go along with not only does heard play as the character in such a rich and tasteful manner making it all look natural but mera herself is a well written character in this filmi cant say much for the villains they were mostly alright and did their part in the film its also nice to see dolph lundgren and willem dafoe in a superhero flick being a fan of the original spiderman trilogy its great to see willem dafoe in this filmthe cinematography is one of the highlights of shot in beautiful locations including newfoundland canada sicily morocco and underwater itself its usually difficult for films to have underwater sequences and make them entertaining one of which include james bonds thunderball 1965 which dragged the film but this is were talking about and he has no problem handling the watersthe script itself is good and the cast dominates it but it can get spicy at times there can be scenes where theyre supposed to be serious but then breaks a curse word or an insulting remark something that while it might go with halfhuman personality it sort of underminds many scenes its not enough however to become a serious problemthe music is not very memorable while it does its job none of it seems catchy at least to myself its usually a long road when it comes to making a hell of a theme for a superhero film such as john williams superman theme or danny elfmans spiderman the score fits the film but its not much to brag aboutthe use of cgi blends in well with the film the only times i noticed obvious cgi was at the beginning with atlanna the fights stunts and such are obvious but other than that the cgi ushers in beautiful visuals of underwater action and scenery which fit in well with the world and plotall in all succeeds as a superhero film its a great action adventure flick and an entry you just cant miss if the dceu continues to produce such great films it will be in good terms with its audience after numerous bad entries,fantasy
the best dc movie since the dark knight risesslows down a bit near the beggining but overall very enjoyable,fantasy
superrrbbb movieverrrryyyyyygoooodd vfxosm,fantasy
for me is a character which i thought was made for a feature release ever since i first heard his story 8 years ago there was something about him that made me gravitate towards him by being born from two different worlds but comes to be rejected by both is a brilliant starting point and his ties to atlantis and the various stories are intriguing his film might not have been what i had thought it would be but it was still excellent regardless of my initial thoughts on what an film should bethe film does a great job setting up arthurs worlds and the perils that he faces below and above blank manta was slightly stronger for me only because this is also his origin film we see how he comes to hate and why he want to make him suffer and it comes from a natural place neglecting to save someone once that happens in the opening i was on board and could completely see why this pirate would trade in the possibility of riches and take the revenge plot instead ocean master is fine he just comes off a little bit sillier from the whole pollution idea i know it ties into social and environmental issues at this time but it just didnt feel the same for me nothing against patrick wilson who was great at conveying the unyielding wanttobe rulerjason momoa and amber heard were just great at their respective characters jason was a standout to me in justice league so to see him getting his own film was great and well deserved while i was worried at first casting he combines is physical presence with his fun loving side to make the character his own amber is a big surprise for me i knew she would be good as mera but she exceeded my expectations her curiosity and relationship with arthur was great and whenever she used her powers i kept wondering when her film comes outthe cinematography and visual effects are out of this world it reminded me of avatar seeing this world brought to life that looks like it was straight off of pandora all the credit goes to james wan for putting together a film which is satisfying to enjoy as well as look at the only nitpick i can really think off is with the quest for the trident while fun and giving us those fun iterations between arthur and mera it does drag and feels like it belongs to a film like national treasure i dont know if it was a leftover from a previous script but it just felt that way to me thats from the plane ride to the beginning of the blank manta fightoverall this film was amazing good performances stunning visuals and a mostly great story for me as a fan of the character this film was well worth the wait,fantasy
 was a stunning suprise with a cohesive and easily understandable story line and brilliant cast members which defy expectations held even by myself ever since i saw the very first trailer back in july i knew that visually it would be a joy ride but everything was just awesome to watch and i do not get criticisms made about the octopus playing the drums and the comparisons to thor it may be slight similar but if you just look at basic comparisons between movies that criticism could be universal plus in ant man 2 there was an ant playing the drums yet octopus is where you draw the line,fantasy
the movie is hell of a ride to begin may be the best visually appealing comic book movie i have ever seenit is already a big hit and the reasons are1 wans take on the characterdirection2 momoa as meraamber as well3 visuals better than lotr and infinity war it could win the most coveted oscar award4 set on the premise of star warslotr universe a worlduniverse in makingthe story is also good there are a few great actors in the movie dafoe and kidman are awesome a triology is in the linethey all love number 3the world wants to see more of so called b list comic characters thats why wb is working on all the characters but batman and supermancant wait to see 2 and 3,fantasy
reel nerd reviewby nelson nantanapibuldirected by james wanstarring jason momoa amber heard patrick wilson willem dafoe nicole kidman dolph lundgren yahya abdulmateen ii temuera morrisonbeing an amazon prime member i was one of the lucky viewers who had the opportunity to see an advanced screening of the film from the conjuring director james wan is a jam packed high fantasy adventure that has call backs to films like indiana jones clash of the titans 80s90s action flicks and the harryhausen films of old except substitute claymation with cgijames wan had a lot of heavy lifting to do with this film due to the fact that the dceu or whatever theyre calling themselves these days is in pretty dire straits after the box office and critical disaster that was justice league in my humble opinion james wan did exactly what he needed to do in giving the audience an entertaining thrillride of a comic book film that looks and feels different than most comic book movies out there wan infused a lot of color and humor and action in his film which is something critics have complained was missing in previous installments in this shared cinematic universeyou can tell momoa is having a good time on screen and because of it we as the audience have a great time along with him mera heard tracks down arthur aka to help her take down his half brother orm as he wants to launch a full scale war against the surface world for the atrocities they have committed upon the sea dwelling populace via pollution and war and only arthur can stop him as he by birthright should be the true king of atlantis think of orm as an environmental extremist if you will who will at any cost exact his revenge upon the worldof course its not as easy as all that and arthur must go on a quest to find an object that will help him in his bid to become the new king of atlantis momoa is a force of nature who brings charm wit and vulnerability to his role as arthur curry amber heard is enchanting as mera the daughter of king nereus lundgren one of the heads of the seven kingdoms of atlantis who joins orm in his bid to take on the surface worldlet me say how happy i am to see a renaissance in lundgrens career giving stellar performances in two back to back films this year creed ii and now the whole cast was just stellar form temuera morrison as tom curry arthurs dad and nicole kidman as his mother queen atlanna its this love story that helps drive the film forward and i like how they bring everything back full circle by films end i wont spoil it as officially the film doesnt open until next week and many of you have yet to see ityahya was so awesome as black manta and from certain events that take place very early on in the film you can at least partially empathize with why he has such a searing hatred for arthur and he is hot on the heels of arthur and mera as they are out and about on the surface world the action sequences that many of us saw in the trailers where manta and his men are chasing down and mera throughout italy was even more amazing to behold on the big screeni attended the hall h panel for at san diego comiccon and the excitement and enthusiasm from the cast about the making of this film was contagious wan jam packed this film with iconic villains friends and lore and some may even find the film overstuffed and to a degree it is with varying tones and sub plots and stories but i feel wan successfully merged everything together for the most part some of the character arcs could have used some fine tuning but thats what future films in this potential franchise are fori loved the action sequences in the film and the epic battle that takes place in the third act was a spectacle to behold i think this is the film that the dceu has been desperately needing that will help solidify this universe as a worthy competitor to the disneymarvel universe i am so happy that i had the opportunity to see this film early i absolutely loved it and i highly recommend it to all of you reading this blog,fantasy
i cant believe that dc took so long to try this kind of writing instead of their usual dark stuff with that being said this is an enjoyable film i had fun with it the best part of it would definitely be jason mamoa he steals the show every single time and he is very charismatic the rest of the cast should also be praised they did their roles well the plot basically follows the story in the comics and i applaud them for not going overboard with the plot james wans direction really impressed me because this could couldve gone really really wrong but it played out well the thing that kinda bugged me was the visuals its not necessarily bad its just very heavy majority of the scenes here rely on cgi and sometimes it doesnt work they sometimes come across as cartoony the pacing here is also weird its way too fast it just keeps transferring from one scene to the next without us getting a breather to soak in the scenes and the characters look like an hour passed even though it supposed to be daysall in all i thought was a great film it was run and is certainly not boring it is a film that i dont mind watching again and again a little too much cgi but still passed to be a good film,fantasy
i felt like this movie didnt have much plot in it and the jokes were kinda unfunny however jason momoa was right there wet and halfnaked during half of the movie which kept me extremely entertained giving this an 8 because of those abs only,fantasy
honestly it felt like i was watching black panther however still enjoyed it better than the last couple of dc movies that came out and flopped,fantasy
one of the best movie for dc in the last years full with action and gd film maker,fantasy
it feels like watching a bunch of cutscenes from videogames not saying that that is badits quests that leads to new questsi do not know if there are plotholes as the concept is a man who can talk to fish and with like superman powersthe film is somewhat silly where there shark with lasers but the action and visuals make up for it,fantasy
great movienormally not a dcjusticeleauge fan but it was pretty good good balance of humor action and a lot of interesting story was told great casting of arthur and meraa lot better than the other dcu movies should be a stand alone with some sequels,fantasy
based on a true story  ok maybe not but it is truly visually stunning obviously loads of fun perfectly cast hot wet people  ok maybe not willem dafoe and his atlantian french twist  meras hair is more distracting than black mantas canonical helmet  jason mamoa is the embodiment of the best spin on this character and entertaining in every scene unnecessary to be familiar with dc universe or to have picked up a comicbook to be pun intended immersed in the story but director james wan takes many comic tropes and turns them on end well done,fantasy
this movie has everything you want and need in a blockbuster film comedy romance story and last but certainly not least action jason momoa is the perfect man for the job he and all the characters worked out so well on the screen and i think that was one of the most important things to make it such an enjoyable film black manta was my 2nd favorite character behind in the filmhe did such a good job and was a perfect covillain behind orm i think im going to watch it again but on imax to really get the full effect of the beautiful cinematography only thing i would change and im nitpicking right now is the scorei feel some of the songs didnt fit but other than that i really enjoyed the film and cant wait for part 2,fantasy
2018 reviewmy rating 8310the movie is the far different from its predecessor dceu moviesit seems that dceu have learned from their mistakes and understood the taste of the common audience the movie follows a medium tone which is a heartwarming visual treat makes a slow progress in the first half where we get to understand altantis and its people but it is not at all boring due to the beauty of altantis which is a major highlight in the moviethe second half is the heart of this movie filled with action sequences which have the potential to provide goosebumps especially the classic suit scene and climax fight is one hell of a fightjason momoa has brought to life his performance as cannot be defined in words william dafoe and dolph lundgren have served their purpose of portraying two strong supporting characters of atlantis nicole kidman and amber heard succeds in enhancing the beauty of the movie and proves their might as atlanna and mera patrick wilsonking orm and yahya abdul mateen iiblack manta provides the seriouness that the movie deserves at some point they are excellent in their roleson the whole the movie is a must watch in 3d for its visual effects and strong acting performances james wan have provided us with a visual feast which is filled with action sequences comedy and wan also adds his special touch by adding some horror element using the trench monsters the movie has a mid credit scene please dont forget to see it,fantasy
cinematographythis time round in action scenes in particular the camera pans around the action and its really cool to look at shaky cam is also used effectivelyvisualsthe best cgi and visuals ive ever seen in a superhero film maybe action too this film offers the most beautiful underwater adventure although on land the green screens are quite noticeablestoryplotnot exactly the best story it drags around the middle but its watchable and does have a good conclusionvillainbetter than most mcu and dceu filmsoverall is a must see and you should take on your own opinion and dont assume it will be terrible,fantasy
the film came out unusual i did not see jason as however the actor was able to convey the inner world of arthur the plot does not float but smooth and winding locations are vast and incredible,fantasy
if this movie doesnt get 8 overall you all must be mad great movie in every aspect only lose to civil war,fantasy
this is best dc movie i ever watch the cinematography visual story plot and the scene are amazing good job james wan ,fantasy
is the savior of dc or merely that fishboy from the tv well its not perfect but its actually better than expected it seems the character has gotten some justice now with a grand scale movie thats solely about his story jason momoa still goes around with his surf attitude but he ends up growing by regretting some mistakes and assuming responsibility however there are cliches and storytelling tropes which cant be escaped luckily it doesnt bring everything down as the action is fun and the visuals are a feast to the eye its a movie that will entertain to the max an element i was happy to see was the usage of mythology especially greek mythology in this case ive always been endlessly fascinated by what legendary mystic stories could be explored in the profoundness of the sea and that tone was transmitted nicely to the screen i loved the depth in the cinematography youll see the sunlight reach the corals while the characters swim across its vibrant warm and full of life so the visuals were big standouts the story was decent yet formulaic i could have gone with less explaining and skipped of some of the obvious jokes but most surprisingly it finds moments where clear human purity is brought out the tale about arthurs parents his training with willem dafoes vulko even his relationship with mera doesnt come across as annoying considering its super obvious that theyre gonna be together it somehow works on plain simplicity its nothing too much just clear and simple enough that you can see the sincerity thereits bloated given how grand james wan wants to go with the story you better stay awake for two hours because this thing moves like sharks chasing their pray the action is always energetic except for when they decide to throw a character into a wall the parkour setpiece was a lot of fun partly with how well thought out the shots were and where the next part of the sequence would lead to and this is coming from someone who thought it looked stupid in the trailers loved the look of the bad guys manta has been one of my favorites and its amazing to see him adapted properly on the big screen i wanted his part in the plot to be even more integral ocean master is ok at best his costume and helmet are great but the guys a bit of a shakespearean villain cliche i will give him credit for at least having a motivation i understood and agreed with his solution to his problem however thats where the villain aspect comes to play i would also have trimmed out some levity that felt pandering some of the characters didnt get enough development to make you undertand their place in the story i was kind of confused as to who mera was and what she was up to during the first act but to be fair that may have been because she looks so otherworldly it drew me away anyway it is a fun movie and a lot more decent than i thought it would be just be ready for some stupid bits here and there or very convenient plot points but the visual spectacle delivers with some imaginative underwater worlds and creatures better than justice league which doesnt say too much but i see this being very enjoyable on repeat viewings,fantasy
the movie starts off with action scenes which balance crazy camera angles ith onpoint physics its immersive from the beginningthe character devolopment is wonderful  we see black mantis devolop as does through the movie the chemistry between jason momoa and amber heard is endearingthis is an adventure movie at heart the feeling of exploration never leaves the world building is masterful and every place momoa goes to is elaborately constructed its like playing an rpgthe story builds do not expect a movie along the lines of justice league1010,fantasy
obviously the special effects budget was off the chain momoa was great heard was great the lines and frankly performance of kidman were terrible im a big fan but something was wrong for her in this movie it is her exceptioni buy and watch marvel and dc movies as a rule but maybe on this one,fantasy
thanks to amazon prime i checked it out tonight is crazy fun momoa and the rest of the actors are super great yes it definitely has some amazing visuals and very cool fight scenes james wans world building is sooo good it makes you want to see more of atlantis all of this is what you want in a film about a superhero i hope wan continues to make more sequels,fantasy
great movie exceeded my expectations good start for on the big screen,fantasy
just watched it and i was blown away by the storyvisualsits a full package,fantasy
my ohh my from the trailer itself it was evident that this will be entertaining  but the only doubt was that will it have all the unwanted witty moments they tried to put on the movie likejl naaah itstead james wann had thrown me and also most of the viewers back to the childhood days of comic books jam packed action amazing visuals pretty strong character development even on a movie where there is little time to develop characters yeahh there are few medium rare charectors  but we can forget that all just for the sheer fun the whole movie gives us jason mamoa as is my favorite super hero period what a flawless performance my him  grace and command is just oozing from him on all frames and mcu has to step up their game on female leads coz after wonder women we got 2 strong female leads on queen atlanta and mera  nicole kidman is gorgeous as well as powerful  so is amber heart great visuals  strong performance got more than what i had bargained for  long live the king  rules,fantasy
the most epic movie ever in my life my eyes my earsand my entire body got blessings by this amazing movie salute,fantasy

one of the most beautiful super hero movie i have ever seen james wan did awesome job with vfx and camera work characterisation of cast is also top notch and best part of this movie is entertainment with most stunning visual is like apple for your eyes i loved it so far for me best movie after dark knight trilogy just bit further than wonder woman but i like it more than ww thats why else both are awesome movie dc surely has mad mistake by releasing justice league before solo movies of those individual characters cause so far i loved all solo movies man of steel wonder woman those movies are awesome,fantasy

dc has done a nice work after a long time i thinkhehe,fantasy
as a die hard mcu fan i must say you need to watch this movie and you need to find your local theater that has the best imax system to watch this moviei watched every single mcu movie within the opening weekend and i never found such enthusiasm for dc movies hence why i only watched now almost a week later the last comic book movie that made me feel this good after first time viewing was the avengers that was the moment i realized my beloved marvel characters had finally come to life just gave me the same feelings for dc characters since the dark knight10 years ago i watched avatar in imax 3 times sure the plotline wasnt anywhere near special but it was visually groundbreaking since then i never truly found a movie to be its worthy visual successor and now such a movie finally arrivedthe third act of is beyond anything i have ever seen the battle scale makes infinity war looks like playing house yes im kinda salty about it endgame better up its game i dont know what they did to the sound system at one point i felt like the theater was about to take off the ground was shaking like a leaf like i was sitting on top of a dualshock controller stuff like this reminds me why i love going to the theater so much it completely immerses me into another world full of imaginationsim going to watch it again the next tuesday morning when nobody is in the theater ill sneak in some homebrew latte and enjoy the movie all by myself,fantasy
that is a bang from dcu  like literally in honest opinion i felt this movie was better than the movies offered by mcu  what an action pact movie with fantastic graphics unbeatable  im so much impressed and happy and wish for dcus huge success ,fantasy
fed up of these super hero science fictional films of hollywood,fantasy
cheeeeezy terrible sound track and every line was predictable,fantasy
essentially 2018 is an adaptation of the animated justice league throne of atlantis 2015 except its twice as long twice as sloppy and generally just twice as bad doing less in its onehundred and fortythree minutes than that film does in its brisk seventytwo and only making changes for the worse some of which have to do with the fact that this film somehow comes after justice league 2017 funnily enough its around the time that pitbulls new africa cover starts playing that the film really takes a dive as its here that its macguffin treasure hunt really sinks in leading straight into a conventional and oldfashioned feeling superhero story that even at its best which is a decent sicilybased actionscene floats along providing nothing more than a shallow level of engagement if this is the best that dc can conjure up were in deep trouble 510,fantasy
no comment,fantasy
 is a total badass in this the visuals are amazing and the fight scenes are sooo good story telling is little eh but villain has decent motive which isnt very common in most movies some parts didnt make sense but all in all a good first step for dc,fantasy
this movie is directed by james wan who is previously famous for directing movie saw back in 2004 which im pretty sure black manta has no idea of otherwise he would have saved his father since he got guns and swordsalso in one scene you can see princess mera chased by a bunch of cooked lobsters but if you see carefully enough you will find they are actually stormtroopers wearing crab shellsand finally we who possess the most advanced technology on this planet choose our leader by bloodline and through fistfight wakanda forever,fantasy
i can tell the with a sentencei saw really poor visual effects it was pretty similar who find the mother in different univers in the movie you know i mean antmans second movie im pretty sure we will see game edition for because movie like a simple adventure gameif you are not 12 yo do not waste time for this movie,fantasy
france would be proud of the amount of cheese produced in this movie its oozing left right and centrepoor acting lame lines and lazy directing,fantasy
i saw this movie in theatres with one of my good friends and let me tell you this movie was bad we are both marvel fans but are also interested in dc comics and i want dc to succeed this movie just set dc farther back from marvel than it already was everything from the cgi to the score was so unbearably awful that all we could do was laugh in the first scene when the queen was awkwardly eating a fish out of the tank i thought okay i guess that could be funny if you think about it and then the militaryguard people came to take her back to atlantis and their costumes were so horrendous but still i thought i will give this the benefit of the doubt and im sure the movie will be better than this however i was wrong it gets so much worse than i ever would have thought there were so many plot lines to take in at once it was just so confusing some people might say well if you read the comics you would already understand a lot of it but thats not how an origin story should be i would understand if there was multiple movies before this that i needed to watch in order to understand but there wasnt this is an origin movie dont even get me started on the music what the hell were they thinking the love story was no love story at all they looked at each other sexually twice in the movie and at the end i guess theyre in love or something i dont know at the beginning of the movie seems to be invincible and gets a grenade launcher shot at his chest and hes fine but then later in the movie he gets stabbed and almost dies maybe i missed something i probably fell asleep from boredom bc this movie dragged on and was so hard to follow do not waste your money to see this movie it is unbearably awkward i have much more i could talk about that is wrong with this movie but im tired of typing i dont know how this movie could be watched by producers and movie makers and actually be sent out to theatres you have been warned unbelievable,fantasy
excellent movie with wonderful vfx and choreography loved it,fantasy
this was one of the worst movies ive seen in awhile the story was horrible and the music was just awful extremely predictable too cant believe i wasted 2 hours of my life,fantasy
this movie is together with wonder woman man of steel and justice league a true competitor for the marvel universe great storyline combines with the directors visionary mind done an amazing performance for this,fantasy
yeah i admit the dialogues and the plot was pretty bad but cmon everything else were overally good right the special effects were really charming and acting of jason momoa was brilliant this movie seriously deserve more good ratings,fantasy
how many cgi bioluminescent jellyfish can fit on a movie screen dozens and dozens what i remember is monotonous cgi fastaction undersea battles for 2 hours and an evil power ranger dressed in black with a big bug head shooting lasers from its eyes  thats supposed to look scary its absolutely cringe worthy no character development at all  a real lost opportunity since a lot more could have been explored about origin and being different trying to adapt in the human world his emotional struggles etc instead theres 2 hours of cgi battles no dialogue with soldiers riding on shark back chernobyl crabs and squid ships firing laser beams no actor could save this movie and jason momoas talent and charm were wasted,fantasy
wow i thought i was watching tin tin for the first 30min so bad the reviews must be from ladies who love khal drogo,fantasy
plot holes everywherewhere is the reason for him wanting to become a herowhy is he as strong as his brother when he lives on landwhy can he fight so well underwater when he was trained to fight on landchances of his mom surviving and finding the trident impossiblewhy didnt she die when trying to get it clearly everyone else didwhy can some atlantean breathe on land and some cantwhen and mera and walking in the desert with no supplies how are they not dehydrated especially since they are atlantean somehow they randomly find the entrancelooking thru a bottle on a statue somehow points the way how the hell does that pinpoint anything its a direction they dont know how close or far they need to gothere are so many problems with the story i can go on for a while simple things overlooked in the script how can this be considered a good movie it was so bad,fantasy
the is great movie i watched it coz jason khal drogo and love itonly i wish that amber wasnt in itif there a 2nd movie plz change her to another actress for the same rolethere is alot who can do better,fantasy
it is awesome if you love superhero movie i am giving it 8 coz it is better than justice league animation 810 story 7510,fantasy
what has happened to the marvel films first ragblock infinitesimal wars now this its just an expensive kids a film right absolutely dreadful dialogue and acting real cartoon stuff,fantasy
is film is very badi dont know why james wan directed this filmthis film is the worst of james wan works,fantasy
this is the most epicest movie ever if you dont see it you dont love epic film a must watch for every epic person to ever epic,fantasy
how this is anything above a 50 is beyond me what a hot mess this is genuinely a terrible movie from the acting to the cliched nature of the film to the overthetop usage of cgi oh wow was this ever garbage,fantasy
director james wan and actor jason mamoa have done what many considered impossible theyve taken the comic book character of long considered to be the lamest of comic book heroes and turned him into one of the coolest action stars on film not an easy task and yet together they make it appear easythe film opens in the past when a wounded queen atlanna nicole kidman washes ashore near a lighthouse in maine in 1985 thomas curry temuera morrison the lighthouse keeper finds her and takes her to his home nursing her back to health the pair fall in love and soon have a child together they name arthur but the forces of atlantis searching for atlanna have found her and come to take her back failing to do so when she battles them off realizing the only way to keep arthur safe is to return she does soyears later a group of tech pirates led by jesse kane michael beach along with his son david yahya abdulmateen ii attempt to steal a russian sub killing those on board they encounter but their plans are foiled when the now grown arthur mamoa lifts the sub to the surface boards it and takes out the pirates when a hand to hand battle finds david fall arthur is shot by jesse only to rise again as he attempts to leave jesse shoots at him dislodging a missile that pins him unable to lift the missile david pleads for help and arthur refuses leaving them behind david is forced to leave his father behind to die and swears revengeonce more time passes and now we move on to the undersea world of atlantis where king orm patrick wilson is trying to unite the undersea kingdoms to attack the surface world in retaliation for the constant damage they do to the seas by his side is advisor nuidis vulko willem defoe who has secretly been training arthur at the request of the now dead queen before orm can unite the various underwater tribes mera amber heard the daughter of king nereus dolph lundgren king of one of these tribes seeks arthur for his help in stopping ormarthur refuses saying he wants nothing to do with the undersea kingdom mera warns him that this wont stop orm from attacking the surface world as arthur drives his father home a tidal wave hits the shore and only the assistance of mera can help him save him this is the first launch of orms attack and causes arthur to reconsidertraveling to atlantis he learns about a long lost trident that only someone worthy is supposed to be able to wield he just needs to find it before he and mera can set about their quest they are found by orms men and a faceoff between the two stepbrothers must take place all of this and were not even half way through the movie but it sets in motion the search for the trident arthurs change from superpowered mortal to potential ruler of the sea and the possible salvation of atlantis and the world not bad for a first solo outing for the characterso what makes it exceptional im slowly becoming a movie goer who is tired of the overuse of special effects in films but at the same time im aware that movies about superheroes lend themselves to special effects just to present them properly and this film does exactly that using them to surround the action and not take over the undersea world of atlantis is a view to behold a combination of light and texture fueled by color that delights the eyes wans experience with effects in previous films lends itself well on that count the entire team behind the film has done an amazing jobbut if the character comes off too corny or too serious the film would fall flat as well mamoa does a fantastic job here combining the right amount of humor with the muscle bound super heroics needed to bring the character to life he does so with ease making the character not only believable but actually cool in the process he even makes the much mocked orange and green outfit associated with look greatdc films havent fared as well as the marvel films in the past and the main reason ive always felt was their compulsion to portray their comic universe as dark and gritty even the bright colored costume of superman somehow turned dark with wonder woman and now this film theyre taking a new direction and the box office has shown its working hopefully theyll continue down this path is an adventure a love story a comic book hero tale and a movie that doesnt overdo the message about pollution so much that it damages the rest of the film kids will love the character moms will drool over mamoa and dads will enjoy the action its a movie that the entire family can and should enjoy more than once i know it will take a place on my shelf,fantasy
mrs shullivan and i spent our sunday afternoon waiting to relax in front of our tv while watching and when i plopped the disc in and started to get involved with the characters we were both quite impressed nicole kidmans performance as queen atlanna who falls in love with the lighthouse keeper tom curry temuera morrison was a great start the birth of their son arthur and his eventual maturity into our land and sea hero jason momoa was very entertaining as wellwillem dafoe who plays vulko as both the principle advisor and conscience of the selfannointed king orm patrickwilson as well as the battle weary instructor to king orms half brother is also a key role in the storylinemy interest started waning when we were introduced to the cartoonish raven haired sea queen mera amber heard who although she was promised to wed king orm is obviously smitten by and his constant grunting it is about at this juncture when mera and are teamed up with vulko in an effort to stop king orm from proceeding with his diabolical plan to join all the sea kings under his leadership against the earths surface humans to wipe us off the face of the world when we realize a battle is brewing up until this juncture the use of cgi was utilized sparingly and with good taste as the two half brothers king orm patrick wilson and jason momoa are pitted against each other both feeling the presence of their missing mother atlanna nicole kidman the film takes a sharp turn to the left and the writerproducerdirectors take the cheap way out and rely mainly on cgi computer generated imagery to complete their epic story line so much of the same crash and burn cgi as in many other prior marvel films it is quite frankly a boreas the last ten 10 minutes of the film ending kind of redeems the preceding 45 minutes of far too much cgi if a sequel is to be made jasom momoa as patrick wilson as king orm and nicole kidman as atlanna are worthy of a repeat but i strongly urge the producers to forget about mera amber heard and replace her with a more energized and realistic female lead that can act boy was she baaaaadi have assessed the overall film with a decent 7 out of 10 rating the first half is exciting  the second half is mostly cgi and a bit of a let down not like in the ocean but similar to a stinky toilet flushing,fantasy
dc perked you upwith coffee dont you have enough of your exs moula though your red hair looks fantastic what a bad movie all around basic plot basic characters the only thing interesting is the amount of computer work they put into this i cant see why people really enjoyed this other than the fact the culture mind you whore fighting for the metoo movement are salivating over jason mamoa who really couldnt act his way out of a paper bag anyone know who the grunter in film is well hes the perfect example the star whose built so you take their shirts off and make grunts i think the message behind the film should have been more prominent keep our oceans clean folks its another world in its self one last thing why was harry osborne even in this movie none the less actually a core actor the guy has the opportunity to do anything he wants now from antichrist to making great career choices if warners had him under a magical spell why would they choose this movie make him the villian of suicide squirts 2 and replace jarred letgo,fantasy
the plot is really nice since i didnt read that much of comics back in the 80s i dont want this movie to be exactly the same one thats been written in the 20th century because we have evolved since 1941 and this is not a history movie i dont like the movie to be so complicated so those who are studying cinema or working in the editorial fields enjoy it it is not a graduation essay it is an entertainment movie and was that not entertaining well it was for mei initially wanted to put 8 stars but i added one star for the underwater cgi craziness and for those haters to enjoy it i mean if you are serious politicalnewspapers reading type of a guy dont watch superheroes movies if you want pulp fiction go watch pulp fiction if you are not a teenager dont watch teenager moviesetc but dont put 3 stars for this movie and dont reduce the rating because the only african person in this movie was the villain the black panther movie is rated much higher because or that i mean compare both movies which one was much more breathtaking yet both movies have same ratingthis movie was breathtakingly amazing and joy to watch i watched all marvel and dc movies up to date marvel was ahead by far but this movie returned my faith in dc since bales batman i think this one is in par with infinity wars knowing this is an underwater movie that makes it x10 times harder to make you believe it visually and it did,fantasy
really disappointing film with heavy reliance on graphics and almost no directorial talent seems like a teenager has made the film because the acting the editing and to a large extent the story suck the actors do a great job of making you want to watch something else anything else amber tries to look like she can act for the first half of the movie whereas most other characters are as useless as they come i dont do reviews but i want these precious minites of my life backdont get me wrong i love scifi fantasy but this is beyond comprehension good acting and direection can make up for a lot but this team has made sure people will not watch 2 i certainly wont,fantasy
what a silly campy movie bwahahahahah i cant believe people hated man of steel but are praising this crap plus amber is ugly af,fantasy
after a cameo in zack snyders 2016 car crash batman v superman dawn of justice and a teamup appearance in 2017s equally disastrous justice league the time feels right for one of comicbook lores goofiest superheroes to receive his own standalone origin story after all jason momoas hulking tattooed fishwhisperer was one of the surprising standouts of dcs flop teamup event and with the campy orangeandgreen costume replaced by a longhared and shirtless kiwi adonis the character can now be played straightfaced wonder woman proved that dc could produce quality with the right director pulling the strings and they pulled off a coup with james wan a filmmaker whose talents i have long admired despite many of his films missing the mark for me so it pains me to say that is yet another tonally uneven and bloated effort from warner bros that never quite knows if it wants to make you laugh or feel with a marathon running time which by the time is gets round to its umpteenth climax is about as welcome as a fart in a wetsuitin 1985 lighthouse keeper tom curry temuera morrison comes across a beautiful woman washed up on the shores of maine the woman is atlanna nicole kidman a princess from the underwater nation of atlantis who has escaped an arranged marriage and a gang of atalantian stormtroopers tom takes her in and the two naturally fall in love resulting in the birth of the halfatlantian halfhuman arthur when her enemies come calling atlanna must return to the ocean leaving tom to bring up young arthur on his own the baby grows up to be the beerswilling gymdevotee we saw in justice league but there is trouble abrewin down in the depths arthurs halfbrother orm patrick wilson wants to unite the kingdoms of atlantis and wage war on the surface who have been polluting their home for decades but orm knows that he will never be accepted as the true leader while arthur who has no desire to take the throne is still alive mera amber heard the daughter of king nereus dolph lundgren comes to warn arthur but they dont stand a chance against the might of atlantis without the trident of atlan a magical weapon buried somewhere in the sahara desert certainly isnt short of ideas the problem is that wan doesnt quite know how to cram them all in we are taken across continents on land and to multiple kingdoms under the water with a desire to capture the adventurous magic of romancing the stone and indiana jones the film actually trips over its own ambition squeezing in side characters such as atlantean mr miyagi vulko willem dafoe and the fearsome pirate black manta yahya abdulmateen ii as well as a variety of underwater races we are expected to remember and littering the story with clunky cgi smackdowns wan crafts a colourful vivid world full of giant seahorses and advanced technology but it shares more in common with the weightless computergenerated locations of the phantom menace than the tangible flamboyance of black panthers wakanda yet all of this could be considered a mere niggle had the leads been up to the task but momoa and heard have all the chemistry of two strangers making awkward smalltalk in a lift momoa is an impressive specimen and possesses the charisma to bring this character to life see justice league but here he is denied a moment to have that quiet moment of reflection or to reveal the flaws to his character that would help make him interesting a wheezing confused and sickly borewwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,fantasy
today i will be talking about the movie 2019and give you my impressions about it how arthur curry goes on a mission to find the trident from the first atlantean king atlan how he falls in love with mera amber heard how he faces both black manta and his halfbrother orm marius the ocean masterbefore watching it i didnt have a good impression about the movie judging by the justice leagues movie that i didnt like and also because theyve chosen jason momoa to be i was like drogo will be that will never work every time an actor is cast to interpret a character that he doesnt resemble i get bad vibes at least in my mind he wasnt a good choice the movie proved me wrongi still cant get over the fact that they chose to change personality dramatically i think i have to grow used to it in the comic books is a very formal serious knowledgeable character and thats the exact opposite of how the character is portrayed in the movie in the big screen the character is immature dumb showoffthe characters felt like real people with real motivations i didnt feel forced to swallow anything in it regarding they being who they were both heroes and villains were really well put together the two main antagonists have in common the hate they feel towards arthur orm marius the ocean master brother who sees him as an inferior half breed and david kane later black manta who blames arthur for his fathers deaththe female heroine in this film mera has all the features female characters nowadays showcase in movies they know everything they are extremely strong and super powerful they have an answer for every situation we dont get to see flashbacks of her training or anything about her growing up this narrative dumb impulsive male character plus knowitall female character is getting really old its the biggest clich in the 21st centurythe last scene will leave you without breath the action sequence is just too eye candy and hypnotizing the movie was a whole lot of fun and beautiful experience the ticket to watch it was a good investment i believe the movie is a complete package with all the elements you might like in a movie such as romance that seems real the characters really look like they love one another both couples mera and and arthurs parents the fight scenes were flawless visual effects are amazing everything looks so exotic and attractive the villains were also great the whole plot regarding and ocean masters mother atlanna nicole kidman was really movingi would like also to point out the relationship between vulko willem dafoe and arthur he taught young martial arts including how to handle the trident he was supposed to go after to claim his throne one day and all the history of the atlantean peoplehopefully we can see in a new justice league movie this time with a better script and i also have my fingers crossed so they cast somebody to be the green lantern so we finally have a real justice league movie because in my humble opinion without green lantern the league is not the league it feels more like 6 characters joined together but not the real jlathe movie does a fantastic job both giving new life to the characters legacy and being respectful to the original source material do not miss the chance and go watch it if you havent yet i didnt feel the time passing when i was watching it,fantasy
awesome jason momoa really played his role at its best the other characters didnt disappoint too the movie itself was phenomenal with eyecatching  mesmerizing visual effects i loved the fact that it did not lack funny moments it had a mix of action tranquility and laughter i enjoyed it so much,fantasy
if you thought dcs batman vs superman was awful this one is worse there is background story good now the bad stuff the bad guys in the first scene are all black what yes there is one reason why one bad guy might have to be black but really there is a battle scene every 10 minn there are physicdefying underwater scenes has dc even heard of physics the atlantians enslave creatures of the beloved realm and use them for war the carnage is ridiculous this is like thor without plot humor the romance is predictable and contrived but was the most interesting part when the romance is the most interesting to me you know it is bad gack dc gack,fantasy
wow james wan was the one who dc wants badly his direction is good but there is a problem with story though which was quite niche but we can ignore that due to the best vfx and granduer sets jason and amber did good job i loved the climax which was quite colorful and extravagant in every aspect and particularly that trident thing thank you wan for giving this film to all dc fans out there thank you,fantasy
 sucked so much i couldnt get passed half the movie himself is a cool character at time i felt the movie did not do justice to the actor like it set itself up to fail it also did not give him much airtime and set him up with silly little one liners some of the action was very good and i enjoyed watching nicole kidman kicking ai would recommend watching it it had potential to be one of my favorite superhero movies i am excited to see the main actor in future movies as he definitely has potential to be something3 stars,fantasy
i am watching for the second time just because my brother begged me to watch it he hoped that the movie would grow on me but i still maintain my opinion in this save your money and ditch this movie weak storyline and mediocre acting the only reason this movie has a 2 is because of the cinenatography and the sets anything other than that is a big mess,fantasy
visually impressive and nonstop action unfortunately this action is generic bad guys miss every shot and good guys just happen to survive everythingstoryline is complete generic trash theres a couple of okay scenes bar scene with the dad was wholesome dive into the trench is awesome giant cthulu crab thing was cool black manta could have been cut from the storyline and the movie would have been better off for iti am convinced that the high scoring reviews for this film were from film staff as there is a massive amount of 1010s posted weeks before the films release which has skewed this films rating significantlywait for dvd release dont waste your  seeing at the cinemas,fantasy
really nice action movie of course it wasnt amazing avengers was better there are some boring scenes where people are talking too much and when action is starting the scene is overcrowded and its very hard to fallow the plot sum up very nice dc movie worth to watch 810,fantasy
 is a much lighthearted dceu movie than weve previously seen more so than wonder woman it has its pros and cons of course pros would be that you werent taking the movie seriously and cons would be that the comedy just fell flat at timesthe cgi looks pretty good i absolutely love the colors they used but parts of the story was actually pretty horrible manta is one of the most stupid characters in this movie and his story was awful plain and simplemanta and his father murdered innocent people on a submarine saves the remaining innocent people mantas father is trapped manta begs to save his father who mind you just killed a bunch of people when doesnt save his father manta has the audacity to be upset really piss offanother small issue i had with the movie was the kissing scene between and mera while half of everyone youre there to save is dying in the background youre busy smacking those lips for half an eternity theres probably time to kiss after the whole ordeal is overyet another small issue i had was some songs that were extremely misplaced i swear i heard pitbull somewhere and thats never a good thingthat being said i really enjoyed the movie,fantasy
the cinematography is amazing but the story and the writing is ridiculous and kept taking me out of the movie,fantasy
this may well be the worst superhero film ive fully sat through  bvs and green lantern didnt finish total cringefest everything about this film was done so poorly its honestly a joke the script might have been written by a 7 year old the plot was so thin and unbelievably predictable the majority of the acting was unbearable even my guy momoait blew me away just how unoriginal and generic this movie is and sincerely implore you to save your money the villain ocean master is the most cringe and one dimensional character ive ever seen that goes for all of them as this movie has zero character development other than the clich maturation of the protagonist the cgi and visuals are extremely overdone it might have been decent if they didnt go so overboard with making every suit and city so over the top and what is with the totally unrealistic terribly acted news segments in every superhero filma number of things dont make sense but work out anyway because movie logic they didnt even try to put any effort into the romantic arc other than have the two spend some time together,fantasy
i say sensational in addition to what i expected but that i felt i had the ability to be an unforgettable and incredible film in all its details,fantasy
greatest cgi i ever saw in the theaters thumbs up,fantasy
cuz im not a teen anymore and probably have seen to many movies this movie isking arthur pulling the sword from the stone and his knights of the round tablelots of lord of the rings stuff giant stone statues giant monsters of various sizes including a kracken etcstarwars stuff flying ships through lots of tight spaces even if underwater a space battle with lots of dogfighting fighter ships and battle ships all underwaterif they can swim so fast why do they need ships or even the boata bit of harry potter with the hidden world of the undersea people and even some moana stolen plot lines of the bottom of the ocean air bubble and its creatureswhen are they going to have an actual hero that sought out and wants to be a hero and not someone who is resisting and has to be trained while everyone else who is completely trained and educated sit around waiting and dyinghow many die in the battle only to have the two leaders have mommy make them behave themselves and shake hands to be friends again i thought was just as story killing as both of them have a mom named martha even if she was mom to bothrules of physics kept changing sometimes the tridents could go through metal without any problems other times it didnt even scratch the same metal can jump out of an airplane a thousand feet up and not get hurt falls a few feet and gets hurtgirl beats the crap of out the guards without any problem then runs like hell from another guard just like the othersin the beginning the sub stolen by our bad guy to shoot at who the guy who he already has a deal with to start a war so that the shooting sub will make him want to start a warlike i said this movie is great for younger teens logic is out the window so many times but its a lot of fun to watch if you ignore that if you can ignore that i couldnt if this was a one off never seen before first of its kind i would have blasted it more than i already did  as a well informed adult with to many movies seen i give this a 55 out of ten 9 out of ten for everything visual sfx acting dialogue etc minus 4 points for the plot holes and that is being generousit wasnt at all the i saw on tv cartoons as a kid nor in comic books i missed how much he relied on the animals of the seas for help and him not his girlfriend using waterballs as a weapon and there was no hint not in the late 60s and early 70s when i watched and read about this character of an entire underwater kingdom one that could easily outnumber the surface world it is 3 times its size and the tech they got we wouldnt stand a chance but like harry potter they give the right of way to a bunch of ignorant morons like us i doubt it they would rule our asses off and probably better at it too,fantasy
dont want to spoil it do keeping it short and sweet this movie was epic from start to finish fight scenes are huge effects are amazing and holy cow the underwater end battle was worth imax alone,fantasy
a superhero origin story with an aquatic avatar star wars war and indiana jones treasurehunt adventure rolled into one it makes a seaworthy splash amidst all the superhero fares a swimmingly rollicking actionpacked fantasy adventure,fantasy
plot has a little of king arthursword in the stone a little indiana jones  and a lot of avenger type materiel movie is visually stunning cgi is incredible director wan is newest hero of the genre role was made for momoa and momoa was made for this role kidman was believably queenly wilsons performance was valiant  even though he typically comes across as the nice guy from next door a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience plan to take my grandchildren to see it with me for a second viewing,fantasy
by the numbers cookie cutter super hero movieeverything here has been done before and betterwas hoping james wan might bring something different with his back ground but sadly not,fantasy
 is the best science fiction film ever made there are no argument,fantasy
a major spectacle in terms of cgi but the dialogue was a tad cheesy my friend described it well as 7 movies in one the little mermaid red hair sea woman jurassic park dinaosaurs star wars storm trooper like soldiers and more who selected pit bull for the soundtrack bad choice add cheesy music the best part of this movie is jason mamoa,fantasy
after readinghearing about it i was excited to see it but the entire thing fell flat for me jason mamoa seems like such a nice guy but the acting overall was subpar at best it was super cheesey and cliche and the underwater talking to me was just weird and made no sense im a fan of scifi and super hero movies but this one was a big flop in my opinion seems like they just focused so much on the cgi stuff they forgot to entertain you in the process ultimately if you have the time to kill and want to see for yourself go for it but youve been warned,fantasy
okay i was like eh or meh before watching this movie because come on we know how bad dc are about the movie adaptation of their amazing comic storiesbut but i swear this will make you feel like what tha fork as it is really really really amazingi mean of course it has those clichs scenes for example the actors run and there are pewpew gun shootings but somehow they never get shot and that kinda stuff yet it brings all the emotions during the movie and it does it very smartly also what we really needed was seeing different kinds of places in superhero movies i mean arent you tired of seeing the characters in new york or that kind of popular places well i amso this movie really satisfied me by taking us different parts of the world and making it rain underwater i dont even know what im saying it must be because of my happiness i really feel thankful for all the crew everyone who dealt with effects and everything god it is truly amazingwatch it and enjoy the 3d,fantasy
and i love jason momoa i thoughtwell at least ill watch him half naked for the next hourbut not even that i hate the whole movie the explosion resource was way too much used every 15 minutes you get an explosion it was hilarious at some point well yeah if you wanna go to watch a movie and have a great time laughing this is your movie we were laughing for every super cliche escene it really seemed it was a parody the performance of the actorsactresses were awful i cant believe it had such good actors and at the same time so terrible performances how did they accepted to do it so much money should be involvethe best of the movie is actually jason momoaif you are a fan of him well yeah you could wait to wash it at homedoesnt worth it to pay for the cinema,fantasy
before watching this movie i got impression from netizen that this movie will be sux like one of the quote even get a movie from deadpool which i found deadpool 2 is pretty deadwhile watching this movie i found its actually a good movie i like the whole setting action story and dialogs between jason and amberjust that when jason gets the trident its anticlimactic thought there is something more than just whats in the movie also amber red hair is a bit distracting in some scene i got into more focus on the hair rather than the acting,fantasy
after all of these years justice has been brought to the character great story action sequences and visually stunning,fantasy
 is an amazing film it has a great plot cast cgi and visual effects i definitely recommend this movie to those who are into superheroes and those who are looking for a film that they can enjoy with their family,fantasy
after the promising first scene becomes long  silly and predictable it thinks we will be satisfied by a series of computer screensavers to highlight how poor this movie is the impressively looking jason momoa almost fades into the background because of how ridiculous it is no not even he can save it the best part of the movie for me was the goat,fantasy
underdeveloped story and mediocre acting makes for a mediocre movie,fantasy
i wanted to enjoy this movie but about 50 minutes in i gave upi couldnt stop thinking ive seen this movie before then atlantis with its multicolored bridge and im out jason was nothing but comic relief the whole time i had to keep reminding myself amber heard is not scarlett because seriously she sounded just like her sometimes the visuals were cool but they felt recycled and outdatedi mean some musclely long haired snarky guy fights his younger brother for control of a throne by using a magical op weapon he has to be worthy ofdc went for this because it was an easy win and i can appreciate that but that doesnt mean i have to claim i enjoyed it like everyone else who rated this movie,fantasy
deserves a 1010  big jason momoa fan epic film was glued to it all the way to the end  loved it ,fantasy
honestly this movie was very exciting i loved the action sequences the visual compositions and the cinematographyits worst part was that the story was very very similar to how to train your dragon thats not too bad though because it was noticeable to me only after the ending it couldve been unintentional tooanother letdown was the unrealistic cgi even though the visuals were stunning at some points the cgi cancels it outif i were to nitpick id say the villains the ones who attack the surface and always need some supply of water costumes looked cheap and the music sometimes didnt matchbut overall as i said before it was very exciting i was very engaged with the individual events in this filmim just wondering why they casted amber heard i think shes very beautiful but she kind of ruined the moment in the end with a not so convincing announcement,fantasy
now may be one of the best movies of 2018 but did have a thing with the black manta thing the action is amazing the effects were great this was a fun time black manta just didnt work out now not the worst but he had less screen time and it feels weird how that black manta didnt win again when he has way more power doesnt make sense,fantasy
dcs the 6 film in the illustrious dcu is a boring lifeless slog buried under an aggressively rough second act full of more sappy forced romance and exposition than one mere mortal can withstand sure the cgi underwater mainly looks great mostly and wan does pull out some tricks with the action scenes but its just far more flash gordon and far less thor ragnarok and black panther sorry but i just gotta make these comparisons guys sorry,fantasy
this movie is awesome i actually had low expectations but after watching it im totally satisfied,fantasy
i enjoyed the movie good action with quite a good storyline yes it had the fairytale ending but lets hope they step things up another notch for their next movie,fantasy
story line is weaknot as expectedbad actioncostumes is badin the middle of the war between armies they have a time to talk and kissingreally bad,fantasy
it seems like a lot of people on here really liked this film i am not one of them if i wasnt watching with friends i would have given up like a number of people in my theatrewatch it make your own choice but it is really corny and there are teethmarks on all of the sceneryit seems like this movie was written for 10 year olds by 10 year olds,fantasy
best super heroes movie i have watch for 20 years of my life,fantasy
best of best storyline  vfx everthe storyline was really so much good  perfect i watched the movie 17th time but my excitement still working for this moviebest dc film ever they madewe want aqua man 2345we want a aqua man seriesplz honorable director sir james wan make aqua man 2345thank you for the movie,fantasy
i give this a 910 only ripping a star due to the fact that i am a flat earther and the writers should have been a little considerate towards us otherwise its a great watch and goes well beyond my expectations,fantasy
on the verge of a global conflict between the humans living on the surface and the ones from the bottom of the ocean a not so ordinary man whos been avoiding his roots must change his perspective and try to avoid the unnecessary conflictits a superhero movie which focuses on the character which possesses incredible strength and is able to speak to animals underwater featuring a complex story with many twists more or less predictable it manages to keep interest throughout its entire length its full of action drama and even romance to make everyone happy its characters well described and put into play are credible and enjoyable thus being easy for the viewers to empathize with them the actors who play them are also very well picked fitting perfectly within the required characteristics my only complaint regarding the story and the main fact which made me lower its rating was that it follows some stereotypes which are quite hard to ignore take for example an event which happens in the beginning of the movie the one at the end of the scene with the sinking submarine which afterwards brings a new big threat to the protagonist just because of his decision im trying to avoid any spoilers here so i assume youve seen this movie in order to understand my complaintin terms of visuals the movie looks astonishing from the underwater landscapes to the intense action parts you can clearly see that a lot of work has been put into this department thus the end result is simply impressive its great soundtrack also contributes to the unique atmosphere being there when needed while providing a big plus with every appearance i find it very hard to criticize these two aspects regarding the filmits a movie which i personally like very much this type of a one man army simply leaves me breathless only when thinking about it let alone seeing it in such amazing details i liked the story i enjoyed the characters and i definitely liked the actors i was also impressed by the visuals and the music it had i small letdown in terms of story made me lower its rating a bit but overall its a movie which deserves to be seen and enjoyed by comic fans and nonfans alike,fantasy
dc successfully approved they can against the industry film after year and year congrats,fantasy
many things have been said about this movie that its generic formulaic predictable but most critics neglect to mention what an entertaining and visually stunning spectacle this is granted its got some cliche dialogue and some of the humor falls flat jason momoa is a cool guy and very charismatic and despite his obvious departure from the comic book look short blond hair and blue eyes hes got the physical attributes to sell the part amber heard is also a very interesting addition and shes got some of the coolest underwater superpowers from any of the characters in the movie and along with michael shannons general zod we get one of the strongest villains in the new dceu patrick wilsons king orm strong cast very good cgi but what really takes the cake here is the production and costume design the level of detail and the obvious amount of work that was put into recreating every last detail of the underwater kingdoms specially atlantis is breathtaking 3d viewing of this movie is mandatory if ever there was a movie for which this format was created this is it in short a very entertaining and amazing looking film,fantasy
this is the movie the dceu needed a movie with a one set tone and they made it work james wan did amazing with the character of and the action oh the action is just phenomenal see it more than once also i love the villians,fantasy
the origin story of the aquatic ace jason momoa folds into a somewhat incoherent tale of the titular submarine superhero saving us surface dwellers from extirpation by his villainous halfbrother and selfproclaimed ocean master orm patrick wilson while simultaneously dealing with supervillain black manta yahya abdulmateen ii who looks more like a fruitfly than his namesake batoid fish accompanying him is bottleginger mera amber heard a warriorprincess with the ability to manipulate water in whatever way the plot requires needless to say the two atlanteans meet cute and then follow the standard relationship trajectory from swapping insults to swapping spit while agreeable eyecandy in her fishy catsuit i found the mera character to be the worst part of the film and the quippy trite relationship with to be more irritating than endearing momoa is fine in a not particularly challenging role the standardissue wisecracking gruff heroic demigod as is the rest of the cast william dafoe as trusted mentor nuidis vulko is given a little more to work with than the rest of the 2d tropes after a reasonably good first act the film begins to stretch even the most generous suspension of disbelief when and mera jump out of a plane and hit the ground with no more than a grunt and a couple of quips there are lots of heroic poses three point power landings overly choreographed and unconvincing fight scenes all set to a pretentious soundtrack and cumulating in the expected climatic showdown between a bunch of characters that we havent been given enough time or reason to care about the film is spectacular to look at and the 3d cinematography in the version i watched was reasonably effective i probably would have rated the film a point higher if i had watched it without sound but a point lower if i thought about it more i am surprised at the scarcity of points in the goofs section considering the extreme cartoon physics of most of the underwater scenes,fantasy
i hope producers and directors will follow the people behind because its one of the very few superhero movies thats really well madethis is not the case of many superhero movies where the writers directors and producers want to save the best for the sequel there wont be a sequel if the first one is not goodevery movie should be treated like its the only movie and the people behind the film should not be lazy nor should they just think of themselves on how they could make a name on putting some senseless stuff into a movie to call it their ownits not your movie people are paying you the movies belong to the people we are not here to help you build a name that would automatically come when you think about the people who are going to watch just like this moviethere has been high praise for director james wan and rightfully so other superhero directors should follow suit do not create movies for yourself no one is going to watch that but create them for the fansthis movie has become my favorite superhero movie of all time,fantasy
was a waste of time  should say the beginning was good and it was getting worst and worst at the end really boring actually i felt a sleep several times waste of time and money,fantasy
i had to watch it twice and i thinking to watch it again haha,fantasy
james wan is the manthis movie is the most funny of this year with a lot of actioncomedyadventure and a little of horror blows your mindi already watched it 4 times is just amazing go see it and just enjoy,fantasy
this movie is poorly written and directed the only saving graces are momoa and the visuals its a pretty movie to look at but the plot needed more depth,fantasy
too complex storyline going too fast no grip worth 45,fantasy
avatar meets the clone wars meets jurassic park meets underwater godzilla meets what is happening yeah the cgi was cool but who cant create cool effects anymore thats not a standard were still trying to set besides no matter how good your effects are they cant make up for rushed and unrelatable character development bad dialouge forced humor which was painfully obvious and an overbearingconfusing storyline so much was happening and there were so many strange inconsistencies what was with the underwater lightning portal that took them to the center of the earth where there were dinosaurs overall i left the theater feeling like i had been cheated out of two and a half hours of my life and 20 bucks if you can ignore the core parts of a movie that gives it substance and meaning than yeah it was an action packed film with over the top special effects however i personally am not so easily besieged by such deceptions,fantasy
this is an incredibly fun film very faithful to the source material and very well performed by all actors involved photography and visuals are beautiful and though its full of cheesy dialogue and a very poor choice for some of the songs chosen for the film overall its a very entertaining film,fantasy
dont listen to the bad ratings from others ive read quite a few and half the time it didnt even seem like they paid attention to the movie or even saw it this was a great movie visually beautiful great action and decent acting was it the greatest movie ever no but it was supremely entertaining and fun to watch i really hope stupid critics dont ruin the future of this movie,fantasy
this was enjoyable entertainment and a fantastic job done by everyone involved with this film i cant speak too much on the dc vs marvel thing i always liked and saw him on par with superman and batman i found him interesting because he was part of the sea for years i heard rumors of a feature length film and was happy to finally see this one it workswhat made the film first was the visuals its great to see and i saw it in 3d i will eat my hat if this team doesnt garner an oscar nod they deserve it then theres jason momoa as and he fits the bill so much that you cant stop watching him has the difficult feat of being on land and sea and jasons portrayal gives you that struggle and that thing about that he can talk to the fish he can it was nice to see the beginnings of thatpatrick wilson nicole kidman amber herd wilem dafoe and yahya abdulmateen ii rounds it out great as an ensemble cast and then theres james wan the director who made all this work  the actors the special effects  what a wonderful triumph once it got going i could have watched more is entertaining its family oriented and visually brings the undersea world to life,fantasy
would say this is a good movie the movie is pure drivel with few redeeming qualities 610 maybe 710 if youre a fanatic with no discerning critique abilities and a 6 is definitely stretching it,fantasy
well  where do i start  cgipredictable plotcgiwhat was the point of black mambanice looking cgi  really good in fact  but wasnt sure if i was watching an animated film or notblack mamba  looked more like a character out of power rangers what was the point of him  take him out of the plot  and it makes no difference to the film added nothing but a nostalgic nod at the comicslove interest  looked like ariel the little mermaidthe plot  arent those atlanteans stupid when they are meant to have higher intelligence etc  and where were they hiding in the previous films they could have helped against zod terraforming or agains steppenwolfe  bizarreanyway  nice looking but boring,fantasy
amazingly done great actors great effects the best superhero movie so far beautiful story well told finally a true hollywood classic,fantasy
its entertaining funny and has a good story the visuals look good and its not too dark all the time it is a good movie you will not be disappointed,fantasy
one of the most compelling aspects of is the underwater superhero himself while his initial casting was rather controversial jason momoa absolutely nailed the role of arthur curry right off the bat momoa sold his performance to audiences as both a badass and charismatic character that everyone could root for he had the perfect balance of snark that made iron man such an entertaining character and fervor that has made batman such a bigscreen spectacle even with these qualities the future king of atlantis was still a flawed protagonist he wasnt a perfect character which really only made him more compelling as the story went onwhile the actual plot of the movie may have seemed incredibly familiar being another one of the brothers fighting for the throne stories like thor black panther and the lion king it still did a decent job at making it stand out from the competition while there were certainly familiar aspects that were similar to those other movies like the duelling scenes in black panther still kept some originality in the matter in order to keep things unpredictable additionally the movie did a great job of avoiding copout deaths in order to trigger emotional reactions from the audience with all of the emotion in the movie developing from the story itself rather than from these cheap tricks that many superhero movies have ridden on recentlythe absolute best feature of however had to be its visuals whether the scenes took place underwater in atlantis or in a city in italy nearly every shot of james wans was absolutely breathtaking while previous dc movies like batman v superman dawn of justice had clever framing the shots didnt really stand out like the shots in the main difference that made this dc adventure stand far above batman v superman was the color pallete previous dc movies attempted to have darker visuals with a desaturated look whereas wan and his team pushed the limits of color throughout the movies entire duration its color and visual effects were even better than guardians of the galaxy vol 2 which broke records with the amount of visual effects put into itall things considered is a huge win for dc and warner bros pictures its narrative is compelling the protagonist is well developed and its just a whole lot of fun to watch from beginning to end this is definitely a movie that you will not want to miss in theaters as the big screen is truly the best way to experience the visually stunning look that this brings to the table at the end of the day may just be the best dc movie we have seen in years possibly even better than last years wonder woman hopefully this fantastic storytelling becomes a pattern for dc movies going forward,fantasy
this movie is only good in a comnercial point of view its like a movie about jason momoa being jason momoa they thought that they could do whatever they want because momoas popularity would make everything betterthe movie flaws are huge starting with a poor music  soundtrack choice its an annoying mix of every type of tacky music wheres the leitmotiva poor screenwrite bleeds all over the scene a lot of clichsthe mayority of the characters were bad and the acting was a jokethe cast had 0 chemistryonly dc can make superheroe movies this badgreat action sequences and special effects tho,fantasy
this movie in my opinion was the best dc film yet since if this even counts lol christian bale batmans very well put together good visuals good acting manta was a little cheesy acting wise but tbh a very good movie great humor and jason frikn kills it i highly recomend,fantasy
it was good not great i am somewhat confused why the movie had parts of 5 other identifiable movies ranging from thor to karate kid not actual schemes from those movies but when you see this movie youll know what i mean did they really think people wouldnt notice the relation so you paid someone to write a script that took bits of other hero movies and such things and twisted it a little and called it your own no wonder dc movies fail usually hint hint hire the people from marvel to make you a movie that grabs your fans attention and leaves them wanting more,fantasy
visually stunning well thought out and entertaining as any super hero film could hope to be great comeback dc go see it,fantasy
this movie is more like star wars underwater than a superhero movie the villians are great and developed too,fantasy
an exciting dc movieits more colourful than another dc moviei love the story the cast and the viewthis film make dc movie to another levelbut the fire effect when a flight got a shoot in the oceans not match for meafter all this movie is great dc movie n u must watch this,fantasy
i enjoyed but its not even in the same realm as batman begins dark knight or dark knight rises to say this is the best dc movie is ridiculous with that being said i thought was visually stunning and a lot of fun,fantasy
the 2nd best dceu film behind wonder woman wooh honestly this was a bit better than i thought it would be jason mamoa does a solid job here amber heard is a goddess literally and figuratively and james wan shoots a beautiful looking film aside from a few weird cgi uses the story is pretty similar to black panther but its not that derivative there were some cool action sequences and ill admit official suit was pretty fricken sick but the music choices were baffling at times im not ready to say this film or character can save the dceu its a very solid superhero movie but if it was set in the mcu it would certainly be one of the lesser entries kudos for not making a film that sucks though choosing creative directors like james wan will be key to dc regaining some of its former glory,fantasy
after the moderate man of steel just okay wonder woman and a pair of hugh misfitsthis is the movie that dc neededthe ultimate breakthroughby far this is the best entry in dceuevery aspects worked perfectlythe story cinamatography acting direction all of them were excellent jason momoa was born to do this rolei dont know whybut he and trident together its something elsealmost spiritualcouldnt picture anyone else besides himperfect matchand a topnotch performancehats off to james wandidnt imagine a horror film legend would save dceuwhat he achieved so greatly and perfectly is thisthis is the only dceu film where i didnt get bored even for a minute what critics blabbered about this film like they did with other dceu flicksis thatthe running time was too longbut herei left the theatre wanting moreover 2 hoursfull of action adventure and dramabut still i wanted morestill i didnt get enough of atlantis and its crowned heroand why this stands tall than any other dc films except the dark knight trilogybecause for every possible reasonsjust in terms of visual spectacle it is much more beautiful than any of themas a fan of superhero filmsi can profoundly saythis film can surely go toe to toe with any of the mcu filmseven better than some of themgo and witness the revival of dceu,fantasy
first of all its such a shame this didnt get nominated for vfx of the year wan somehow managed to deliver a world never approached before and the cgi and rendering was executed so incredibly the movie itself was so exciting to watch constantly arthurs upbringing brings himself to come forward as king to his nation and jasons interaction with characters like mera and orm was truly something marvelous to watch,fantasy
as promised delivered huge success in its opening weekend and its total profit for a week running it seems as though this is leading dc in the right direction and without wb tampering with their movies the movie was absolutely so fun to watch blink and youll miss something interaction between characters were truly compelling and dont be surprised if you say to side with their antagonists bm and om whether youre a die hard marvel fan or dc you cant not help but enjoy the hell out of this movie,fantasy
just watched the movie tomorrow im just speechlesswhat a story awesome vfxjust out of the worldsuperb directionsuperb acting by all actorsmust watch movie,fantasy
amazing movie good story and great action acting was great graphics were believeable,fantasy
fantastic movie in my historyi never seen this type of movie,fantasy
this is an unbelievable movie with great performances and amazing effects in the water i enjoyed every single minute out of it i never enjoyed dc  marvel movies that much but this movie is exceptional and i loved it so much,fantasy
 spoiler free reviewso im going to gush over this movie pun intendedwhere to start oh i know james wan is a directing and producing genius and the only man who could pull off the perfect moviethe cinematography for this movie is something i never expected but had me in awe all the way through with movement and camera pans and angles that my mouth open saying wow all the way througha multi genre storyline that crosses from fantasy sci fi comedy action and suspenseful horror everything i was not expecting and surprised bythe story is a mix match of every comics origins managed to make every single one connect and work coherentlythe cast is perfect not a single actor is out of place and feels perfect for the role i especially liked patrick wilson as ocean master who gave it his all along side jason mamoaspecial fx and cgi so im always a stickler for cgi in movies but this time i cant say this the put down in this movie is due to props  but only in the costume department where some of the costumes look like outcasts from late 90s power rangers although very aesthetically correct to the comic books some costumes look a little cheap and look slightly cosplayishmusic wow that music i said wow that music a great mix of genres once again that work within the circumstances of the scene tthey are put in to with a mix of orchestral synthwave rock rap this films score works on every levelto sum up this movie had me smiling all the way through it is dcs best movie better than wonderwoman and i love wonderwoman better than batman the dark knight better than watchmen yesbetter than one of my favourite adaptations evergo see this film 910,fantasy
a super hero from atlantis who can talk to fish was never going to be an easy film to make a cohesive plot with so clearly the makers of have decided the best way to cover this is to make it big and spectacular they succeed with this you are never bored whilst watching this film and some of the underwater imagery is beautiful to look at having seen justice league last year the small underwater segment within that film gave some considerable concern on how this film would look what was a dogs dinner twelve months ago is startling and impressive in this filmthe film itself is best viewed with your brain in neutral as several aspects dont stand up to close scrutiny and i am sure the goofs part of imdb will get plenty of inclusions when you start to overthink the film all ill say is that the whole premise is ridiculous so just go with the flow youll enjoy it so much more if you do,fantasy
a movie that contained everything i had high expectations but i left the bion and was more than happy really worth seeing ,fantasy
honestly one good start for dc universei loved the plot lines of man of steel bvs  wonder womanbut after tjustice league  sucide sqad it was pretty difficult to understand despite of having a strong story how can they create massacre in cinematic universe is a good start where we get to see our dreamed atlantis for realoverall a good movie  good to watch good storyone more best thing about the movieyou get to see the badass black manta,fantasy
i didnt think graphic would be so awesomestory is good enoughi dont like father and mother at the ending scene they act weirdanother thing is why you use monster from ultraman it destroys the whole thing it just looks so fake to me,fantasy
its a movie whose sole reason of existence is entertainment and i loved it for that despite its many flawsnice visuals and action pieces heard wilson and kidman are great i didnt like the music and the script couldve been polished a lot better,fantasy
it was awesomei didn t expect thatmaybe is the best movie with super heroes respect,fantasy
mainly watched it cuz my wife wanted to watch it and im sure it was for hinself lol but was surprisely good i enjoyed was a good movie,fantasy
spoiler free reviewi didnt know that james wan could direct something like this the direction is on another level the action sequences are way to much awesome well choreographed and the camera movement is just incredibleeven the first little fighting sequence has the kind of cinematography which i have never seen in any other superhero movie ever james wan is a wizardim sure warner brothers hired aliens to do the vfx for this movie because the animation is just so so so beautiful and unbelievable being a 3d generalist i know how much hard work is there behind making all these scenes possible and it just made me emotional after watching this moviewill watch it again next week,fantasy
i have never seen anything like before what was that i saw this movie more than 5 time,fantasy
just saw the moviei have always been a fan of dc comics never thought they would make an live action movie this was amaizing  the story the characters the cinematography everything was on point will definitely be watching again,fantasy
amazing movie i just dont know where to start im gonna see it at least 23 more times in theater the only take away from this movie is paying homage to the comic boom version of the suit gold and green doesnt go well with jason mamoas features even with that said i still give it an 1010,fantasy
this movie is the best of dceubreathtaking underwater visuals excellent background scorestupendous acting by the team and most importantly a very good story nice effects and a movie worthy to watch again i am already waiting for the 2nd installmentkudos dc,fantasy
now thats what cool stuff is made of do not listen to either positive or negative reviews go watch and rate it yourself every superhero movie fan must go and watch this welcome back dc,fantasy
cant find any word to add review this movie is greet just i cant find my word thx dc for this movie i cant wait to see another movie from this studio,fantasy
 delivers for sure great cgi and acting but sometimes it was just to conry for my taste with the whole kissing scenes and the corny jokes imo but sure go for it the animation will definitely not disappoint you,fantasy
this movie was truly a delight i had previously thought in the jl film was a bit of a let down however in this standalone origins film this all changed with a stellar cast including dolph lundgren julie andrews william dafoe and many more it is a visual effects marvel with some of the best battle scenes rivalling star wars you are continually blown away by the effects and the fact none of this was actually filmed underwater the film equally matches avatar for the effects the movie is long and over two hours plus the usual extra bit after the main titles so dont miss this jason m needs to be careful of not becoming too flippant in movies and be a little more serious in one scene where he talks to his half brother the first line is quite good and delivering and then he ends it by saying but i now know your a dick its not keeping with the rest of the film amber is stunning in her various outfits and probably puts down the best acting delivery of her career i didnt realise just how tall nicole kidman is standing taller than jason all in all this is fab movie and definitely sets up for a sequel marvel now need to look more closely at what dc is doing another superman movie with the fab henry cahill and dc will have overtaken marvel i highly recommend seeing this film enjoy,fantasy
congratulation to james wan he made this movie more light heart than batman v supermancinematography  1010  every single shot great view music  song  7810  some music had a techno beat it doesnt match with movie pitbull song not suitable for this movie acting  1010visual effect  1010  good job ilm character design  910  i dont like soldier design it is too futuristic tone  1010  no more dark in dceu scene  1010  i love some emotional part choreography  1010  great camera movement and fighting storytelling  910  simple but not too complicated worth to watch,fantasy
a fantastic movie and and absolutley incredible effort by james wan and a great soundtrack by rupert gregson williams,fantasy
james wan has created a unique visual experience never seen before good storytelling solid acting nothing amazing but everyone pulls their roles off well only weak point is the writing it could have possibly been better in the script but it could have been edited to fix the writing flaws but it wasnt  overall a very good movie it deserves to stay at 81,fantasy
vfx was so good and the action and story line and making of the movie was awesomeamazing acting by the cast and james wan had done exceptional work with out the second thought the best superhero move if the yeari t deserves an oscar for vfx,fantasy
this is the dc movie that we are waited for james wan give us exactly what we are expected maybe more than that the visuals and the sound effects on this movie is just outstanding dc is just rising up from the dead,fantasy
firstly things i liked the action sequence cinematographyi have to say the cgi works and graphics were too good which makes the empire of atlantis and the unimaginable sea life into realitysome of the music choices were weird some of the jokes didnt land and didnt even need to be therethe storyline would have better if made for an animated viewingi didnt feel a connection to,fantasy
avatar like visuals epic vfx and imax watch is a must,fantasy
it will keep u tethering at the edge of ur seats u and the entire theatre are gonna keep cheering each time momoas does his ass whooping  this is one bad ass movie with jason momoa and james wan steering it into the right direction for dceu at last it was mindblowing spectacular hunk of a movie guaranteed its long but worth the time and money,fantasy
i just loved for every single pointbeginnig of the story the cast underwater mesmerizing scenes fighting ending and everything about the movie is incomparablethis is a kind of movie that marvel can never give us all thanks to james wan for all those engaging sceneswhen i was watching this movie i felt like just going on and oneveryone should go and watch this movie on theaters otherwise youll gonna regret what you have missed,fantasy
i turned it off when the octopus started okaying tbe drumsjeez the old comic writers and artists must be turning over in their graves this old comic fan has had enough,fantasy
i ask just one thing if a superhero movie entertain methey are meant to be fun this wasntim not quite sure how they managed to squeeze in so many clichs plot holes stolen imagery moments from other films and blatant twists but they managed itnothing made sense nothing flowed nothing was viable the cgi was very hit  miss the script was lazy and weak the action sequences especially the black manta fight looked like they were straight out of an early 90s power rangers episodecreating a world is always going to be a challenge and for that reason i will excuse their iteration of atlantis but when they actually make real world locations look like low budget film sets it worries me about the quality of the footage that hit the cutting room floorultimately i wanted to like this film i wasnt optimistic in the slightest with dcs current strike rate but i hoped it would be good in the end i would have walked out happier with dying at the end because at least i wouldnt have seen it comingthis film makes suicide squad look like a success i genuinely wouldnt sit through another showing of this film if i was given a free ticket and free nachos,fantasy
the overall experience of is akin to a watching a mash up of the little mermaid and avatar and unfortunately i didnt like either of those movies these dc efforts lag so far behind the mcu as they attempt to cram far too much backstory into the already excessive running time are far to reliant on cgi toms hair and the wild camera swings and zooms make it incredibly difficult to tell who is winning the current fight scene especially in the ring of firethe movie is the epitome of a tidal wave big loud and tries to throw a lot at the viewer but ultimately little sticks,fantasy
already knew the movie aint that good from the beginning how come the torpedoes didnt blow up after so many grenades and that bomb,fantasy
i honestly cant believe the high rating is this a set up im giving 2 stars because the special effects and visuals are spectacular but everything else was a steaming pile of fish guts that have been rotting on the pavement for days roasting in the hot sun is like a teenage adolescent trying to flex his tiny nut sack in front of anyone who will give him the time of day hes so unlikable i actually wanted his brother to destroy him and all the annoying surface dwellers polluting the ocean darn that would have been a welcome change of pace missed opportunity,fantasy
dcu has been struggling and comparing this to the rest of the universe is a disservice is the first true dcu hit not taking away from wonder woman which paved the way for this this film has everything and seeing black mantra on the big screen is a dream come true crazy film that has an 80s feel this was a strong success for obvious reasons dcu looks to be heading in the right direction,fantasy
i never thought this movie would be this good amazing soundtrack theres no boring scenes non stop action greatest movie of 2018,fantasy
 is the best dc movie since suicide squad its a breathe of fresh air beautifully done acting is amazing so unbelievably good i cannot wait until the sequel,fantasy
 no wordsdifferent story different worldthe ocean king risenfinally,fantasy
i dont know why i ordered this dvd the plot belies stupidity the cinematography is harsh the acting wooden a total cgf of bad even the most childish will find nothing here avoid this stinker if you need a replacement find a bad comic book,fantasy
there arent enough actresses in hollywood we have to be force fed nkidmans stiff and stilted acting again,fantasy
terrible actingterrible storyline terrible case of the runs,fantasy
a simplistic cartoon of a story with shallow twodimensional villains and predictable cardboard cutout heroes speaking painfullyfeeble dialogue between the frequent and overblown fight scenes the superhero genre doesnt have to lack nuance and depth to this extent as several of the marvel movies have demonstrated so i assume the film makers were deliberately aiming at the most undemanding undertwelves with this movie for everyone else the artists and designers involved have worked hard to compensate for the lack of any emotional weight and anything even approaching an interesting plot  so theres a wealth of gorgeous visuals to be distracted by but there are scenes that are so excruciatingly awful that no amount of trickery can save them the moments of triumph are so contrived and hokey that the obligatory orchestral score which swells up on cue is downright embarrassing to sit through i defy anyone not to squirm when steps fullyuniformed from a waterfall or when he stares dramatically at the badguys through the prongs of his trident as feeble and trite as this movie is it doesnt fail as badly as it ought to because recent dc movies have set the bar so low but nothing except the visuals will move you intrigue you or leave you wanting more,fantasy
it just deserve an 1 because ben affleck isnt in itfell a sleep 3 times,fantasy
i still dont get the 1010 reviews tbh i never got the constant feuding between marvel and dc fans i grew up reading both  and liked the heroesvillainsplotlines not which company was behind itbut whateverthis film is atrociously bad i mean they are spending millions upon millions for cgi and actors salaries but have missed the basics  a decent storyline with credible dialogue this i feel was aimed for a more junior audience than myself venom was quite a bit better and he is an antihero,fantasy
there cant be any adult who gives this a good review i can understand an eleven year old child liking this thoughit looks cheap sounds ok cheesy story and acting and the actionfighting is just not very interesting i got sleepy and started looking at my watch after 30 minutes and there was two more hours to goif youre over 15 see something else if youre under 15 see something else,fantasy
love dc movie watch 2x imax family enjoy and love this movie ,fantasy
unnatural sharing stories cause boring funthis one hero story is collecting attention give a joy for funtoo many heroes is less joyfulness,fantasy
in a shocking turn of events dc comics made a great movie that isnt about batman finally with fans get the type of movie theyve always wanted from dc and i see big things for the future of this franchise arthur jason momoa is the son of the queen of atlantis and a mortal man he was born with extraordinary abilities but not with the motivation to use them after his mother was exiled and presumably killed by atlantis arthur wants nothing to do with his people until a world wide threat forces him to take action the story here is the same as your basic comic themed film saving the world while trying to get the girl but what makes really stand out is its incredible special effects seeing as many films as i do its difficult to impress me with a little bit of cgi but this film had some of the best effects i have ever seen even if this was a silent film the sheer beauty and magic of this underwater world would still be breathtaking jason momoa stars in his biggest role to date and this guy absolutely killed it my biggest fear going into this film was that it would be too cartoonish and led by a newcomer not a great combination but momoa is terrific both his personality and in his ability to put on one hell of a fight scene as for the cartoonish part there is a little bit of that and it was a turn off but you do need to pander to the young crowd a film like this is likely to draw for my money this is the best dc comics film since the dark knight im not the biggest superhero fan and i absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end the two and half hours literally flew by and in the end i was still craving more i cant wait to see whats next for,fantasy
under any perspective its an amazing movie the actirs,fantasy
jason momoa shines as arthur curry and brings the tale of some much needed respect is this movie just eye candy nope this movie has it all from action to comedy and drama o myy great movie and great casting,fantasy
best dc movie i have ever been keep up the good work,fantasy
you will watch all of emotion in this movie and wonderful work of actors,fantasy
the storyline has been done to death  outcast hero heir to the throne or whatever makes good in the end every single cliche that has gone before was dredged up for this movie and no amount of ripped actors or curvy actresses could redeem it sure the cgi is impressive but thats all this movie is  one long boring clichefest at no point are you left wondering what will happen next because everything is so predictable what a snooze,fantasy
why are people pretending this is good its baffling bad it was so boringly linear i sort of thought that at this point superhero movies had plot as well as action not in the case of there was no plot twist or surprises or development the trailers showed the mom so dont make that an argument you knew from the very start his aim and he achieved it without much hassle in fact an hour could be taken from the middle of the movie that doesnt add anything the first time he fights his step brotherevery time theres a new superhero movie i bring my little sister to go see it and this was the first time ive ever seen her underwhelmed in the cinemathe acting is absolutely atrocious jason momoa is a bad actor he just has a great physiquethe effects were goofy and badthe funny lines were really out of place and badly delivered as well as badly writtenit was way too long very bored throughouti cant believe this was funded im also surprised that the budget produced thisoverall i found this just so confusing because its reviews arent that bad but its a terrible movie,fantasy
 is a blockbuster realized in 2018 and my friends love this movie not mein my opinion is a bad movie because the plot is really bad  the actors play good and the decors and costumes is good but i think this movie have been creat just for get lot of money the plot talks about i dont know his true name and i dont want to know it so wants to stop a war between the surfaciens and the atlentes the atlentes want to do war because the surfaciens use the sea like a bin and ar half surfacien halfatlanteand mother of she the queen of atlatide the sfx of this movie is so bad look like so mutch a power ranger episode and is unacctable for this type of movie if you like losing your time you should watch,fantasy
james wan ruined macgyver so why not give him a chance to ruin why do they keep throwing money at this guy he sucks and an additional star knocked off for casting amber heard i wish i never heard of her she acts about as well as a block of chalky cheese at least cheese stinks politics is ruining all the entertainment,fantasy
look at that marvel trolls ha ha ha dc comics forever ,fantasy
its like someone took all the terrible scenes from the transformer movies and forced them to have underwater hate sx with the power rangers movie please stop making these terrible dc movies,fantasy
im a big fan of the director james wan because he is able to blend realism and fantasy in a convincing way and this movie is a great example of this the lore was interesting and the movie did a good job showing backstory with quick flashbacks that didnt distract from the main plotto start off all the acting was amazing but i have to give a special shout out to patrick wilson orm the villain could have easily came across as comical but wilson brings a gravitas to the role that made the movie epic jason momoa also did a fantastic job and his screen presence really shows in every scene and thats important for a role likethe cgi was fantastic especially for all the underwater scenes the creatures looked realistic and the world building was really great i loved the camera work in the movie a lot of directors get too comfortable shooting in flat boring angles but this movie really showed how a visual medium should look to help bring out every scene from the wide angles to the close ups everything looked inspired and interestingi did find some of the music choices questionable at times and the songs distracted from the what was happening but at least they were short moments in an otherwise great scorei really loved the fight scene between and orm the tension and action was perfect and the small comedic quips landed i also really liked speech before he got his tridentthis version of was greatly improved from the justice league movie you can really understand his motivationsi really got to hand it to dc this time i havent had this much fun watching a dceu movie since the dark knight1010 would recommend ,fantasy
ok lets get this straight is a decent enough film there is plenty to be excited about and its visually spectacular hell if we went by the first ten minutes this would be a ten dc always does what dc does thats take itself too seriously ant man and deadpool are perfect examples from marvel where you practically take the piss out of yourself and still be great dc are known for darkness are mystery is meant to be light heartedthis movie in particular as stated earlier starts off excellent character development and storyline also off the bat jason momoa is perfect for the role with his wit and general persona the actual main plot is very thin though even for dolph lundgren standards im by no means saying dont go however just lower your expectations a little bit its overly long for what it needs to be,fantasy
best of the best like it very much perfect acting  nice scenes great action fight best graphics all the best one of the biggest challenges,fantasy
amazing visual effects and sound editing stunning fight episodes,fantasy
i have been looking forward to this all year ever since the cameo in justice league sadly it wasnt worth the wait ok cgi but too many monsters and over the top cgi not enough bashing baddiesbad dialogue no chemistry and weak biting plot still ok popcorn movie dc still struggles greatly against marvel,fantasy
i really wanted to like this movie because im a fan of from way back and i would love for dc to get back on track but this doesnt do it it felt off as far as tone as if wan couldnt decide when it was supposed to be serious and when it was supposed to be funny almost all of the jokes fall flat only 2 old ladies in our showing laughedmy biggest complaint is all the recycled material orm is like loki just way more over the top that final battle scene was straight out of lord of the rings  water orcs and jonathon rhys davies and all there was even a shot that looked straight out of avengers with the chitauri bursting out of theleviathanalso with all the cgi youd think they could wipe out the awful wig lines seriously the worst wigs everand dc seriously needs to get over its mommy issuesthe good things some of the fight scenes were amazing im so glad they kept the snyder slomo to a minimum the animals were beautifully rendered for the most part and i really love thomas curry i could have done with more of himoverall not as good as wonder woman but better than everything else in the dceu so far,fantasy
what happens when you try to put your effort in being some one else mcunothing thats rightdull lame jokes jason mamoa  wasted potentialdc should stop making movies that are dull and boring and save the grace,fantasy
this movie was the best by far out of the dceu best visuals ever incredible comic book accuracy brilliant cast,fantasy
tis pbn actioner doesnt even try to hide it is ripping off camelot and the sword in the stone legend i mean they called arthur for god stakeblack mantis is great costuming and the requisite female muse of mera is fine as portrayed the gorgeous amber heard good prequel to a sequel of justice league,fantasy
you have no rights to hate the movie its beautifulllyyy potrayed i didnt watch the movie i lived itwatch it youll love it,fantasy
up until wonder woman id lost all hope for any good dc movies then their justice league movie sucked too which just made me go back to hating anything in the dc universe again while my wife and her friends were shopping a friend and i decided to catch a movie last minute we decided on because it fitted with our schedule i sat in my chair expecting another failed attempt at a good superhero movie wishing that this was any marvel movie other than ant man was i ever wrong this movie had it all great storytelling and the cgi was breathtaking acting was very good all around the movie had so much depth and didnt rely on awkward teenage humor to carry it through heavily emotional scenesjames wan did an amazing job at directing this movie and i really hope that he gets his hands in more dc flicksif dceu can keep up this momentum i really think that they can find their own in the new era of superhero moviesi have no idea how anyone who enjoys superhero movies could give this less than a 7 also as per usual ignore rotten tomatoes and their biast reviewsdo yourself a favor and see this in theatres the effects are made for the big screen and will leave you absolutely submerged in the underwater universe well done dceu,fantasy
the movie is overrated which is understandable because it has jason mamoa the plot was predictable though the movie has some of the amazing under water and fights secnes,fantasy
with a dull lineup of 2018 blockbuster winter superhero action flicks rises to the top although highly entertaining with stunning visuals the movie falls short spoilersyahya abdulmateen ii black manta draws the shortend of the stick despite having the bravado of wesley snipes mateens character was too flawed an origin storyline deserves better dialogue despite unintentional comedic relief the character served as a distraction when mateen revealed himself as black manta i swear the audience heard black panther when mateen obtains atlantean tech he turns to the camera deadpan and smolders cheese anyoneif there was anywhere in the movie where one could insert comedy it should be when characters referred to ocean master fittingly momoa should have taken jabs at this title he certainly saves in other areas heard mera nails the look totally hot but faces a battle with terrible dialogue especially towards the end when momoa is crowned as the kingno quarrel with the cgi some parts seemed too rushed an epic underwater battle that blurred together for a good 3 minutes the audience could not tell what was happening and in other parts way too slow for example momoa is introduced shirtless in the first few minutes inside of submarine great audience cheers all of sudden the scene cuts into an odd 80s slow motion did the studio cut corners with the productionlastly the soundtrack its clear the studio was aiming for refreshed retro 80s nostalgia a page out of thor ragnarok sure lack of originality but i enjoyed it actually wanted morehopefully dc continues to step up its game looking forward to more,fantasy
watch drunk for a better timethis movie wasnt a disaster only becuse it was so stupid that it made my group and i laughwhat made us laugh1 and hot fish lady walk out of the ocean to a pitbull song2 random romantic comedy scenes3 nichole kidmans need to change outfits in the midst of a war only to make an appearance when she is no longer needed4 unnecessary scenes buff looking bikers fan girling over5 the child scenes hahaand so onoverall it was visually pleasing and the second best dc film after wonder woman,fantasy
i am a dc fan i love these characters and and constantly let down jason momoa is great and i would see a sequel but the writing was sky high level corny constantly through the film ryan reynolds saying well thats lazy writing popped into my head the editing was good visually it was great but whenever people spoke or even some of the dramatic pauses i couldnt help but cringe i felt like the power rangers reboot was less cringy and campy once again jason us perfect for this role i think they tried making it more lighthearted but instead they made it more cartoonish im pretty sure they used a womp womp sound at one point for comedic affect anyways thats just my venting about this go make youre own opinionshazam is our only hope dc fans,fantasy
i have watched all of the marvel movies and i am a big fan however this movie blew me away i would say its better than many marvel movies hope dc keeps going like this,fantasy
100 cgi battle i like the styleits not like any movie frommarvel but dc maked with a good technical movie,fantasy
non stop action and eye popping visuals that requires multiple viewings just to catch everything if there was one thing it can improve on is to slow down a bit to develop the relationship between the two main characters a must see in big screen,fantasy
no spoilerswowwwww was amazinggg for a movie thats 60 underwater and 90 about life underwater they did an amazing job creating a comingtolight story for and the depths of the other 70 of earth highly mythical with echoes of lord of the rings game of thrones and polynesian culture dcs was an actionpacked breathtaking movie you have to see you actually forget youre watching a superhero movie for a momenti admit i intially had doubts about the actor but now i think he fits the role well for a modern version of aquman a brute persona with an amazing costume thats improved from the original plus its good to see an ethnic minority as a strong protagonist in 2018 i love you dc,fantasy
this film tells the story of a half breedson of the queen of atlantis who is forced to fight for the thronethe visuals are spectacular and the number of famous faces also adds to the entrainment value however i find the story a little too focused on negative stuff it doesnt offer much hope love or positive vibes in general it is also very much anchored to fantasy and it feels very detached from life i guess thats why i prefer marvel films,fantasy
 threw out of the window 90 of mcu just like that after i went out of cinema i was really wondering if perhaps wb were intentionally trolling themselves with previous productions to make everyone thinking that dceu sucks only to make the biggest comeback ever im no longer pesimistic about next movies from this franchise im really convinced that there will not be any crappy movie after they achieved so much for a character that is not the biggest icon in dc universeand they did that in the best possible moment cause upcomming captain marvel will be sour sjw trash and if shazzam will keep the level of im trully convinced that it will dc will catch up a lot from the distance to mcu and this is possibly the best news for fans of comic books like myselfwell done wbdc you cought your opponent of guard and served him very mean left swingps the line that jason mamoa spoke in conversation with sea monster is the best line i heard in superhero movies ever and i dont recall even one mcu production with a line that good those who saw the movie im sure will agree those who didnt i envy you emotions when you will witness the momentthe movie isnt perfect but its actually very close to be considered as such and one of the best comic book inspired movies everso today let us all praise the king of atlantis,fantasy
the movie is great lots of amazing scenes love it,fantasy
awesowe nice can rise the dc comic one of the best dc movie ever,fantasy
the film is very beautiful more beautiful than avatar visually the script is clich but does not bother the protagonists are charismatic is one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen,fantasy
visually stunning moviebest visuals i ever seen in a moviestory is okbut eye cathching visualsand action scenes were also very goodbut one thing i want suggest u that u should watch is on imax 3d for the best experience,fantasy
its what we deserve from the dc universe  brilliant movie best picture contender omg,fantasy
both dc and marvel are producing hit after hit wonder woman black panther antman  wasp and now has joined the ranks of highly entertaining fare,fantasy
if not for the atrocious dialogues totally misplaced music choices and some bad editing that ruined some really good action choreographies this could have been a lot better the visual effects were great jason momoe was charming amber heard had a pretty good role and patrick wilson and his character was not utilised enough the tone of the film was all over the place but it was entertaining throughout the runtime,fantasy
there are some ridiculously interesting sequences but put that aside and the movie is one thing pure fun ridewith no real ties to the rest of the dcu movies this one alone gives some relief here definetly acquaman gets his redemptionif for the fun only go see it,fantasy
one of the best movie of 2018 definitely best one among all dc movie the storyline action sequence emotions are balanced and are appropriate for a ideal superhero movie a must watch with family,fantasy
i dont know why some people are throwing negative reviews it is a super hero movie and we should watch the movie keeping that in mind i dont see a reason to rate the movie 9 at least completely awesome and kudos to the director to make me watch without moving from my seat fight between brothers is an old concept and is there almost in every superhero film the grandeur and the screenplay matter a lot and is superb,fantasy
absolutely amazing wanted to go back in and watch it again,fantasy
just back from watching this first of all 100 i love all the cgi effect in this movie omg it blown me away  eyes popout but there are a lot boring part in this movie some part seems like lazy writing to make it goes faster so they dont waste time on their journey i love to see the battle angle in this movie very fresh and very enjoyable watching it very recommended watching this but dont put lot of expectation to be good as wonder woman either i will go for second time to watch this  yes absolutely,fantasy
not bad but not that good for me first dc always weak building the characters only batman series did wellsome cast in my opinion is not suitable enough and too cheesy romance element once again imho and too many other movie elements insidespoiler the atlantis gave the impression like dcs wakanda and mera is like the scarlet witchwhen arthur arive at the jurasic land he almost met peter quill before he became star lord and when he recieve the trident arthur awaken the kaiju thus disrupt the earth to build giant robots to match itafter the peace valko live in the land and make a succesfull company called oscorpking orm after the defeat also try to live in the land married to a human and begin to have interest in supernatural things,fantasy
james wan with his vision of atlantis and his flare for action saved this expository and unoriginal script from producing a shocking film,fantasy
that shark scene in the aquarium is just the besthe used to be a joke way before mainstream comic book movies became the norm but to make his comic book suit work on film is just an astounding feat those orange scales and green leggings fit perfectly and does not look cheesy at all for that  i applaud the team for not shying away from the characters rootsas to the movie itself i admittedly enjoyed the second half way way more than the first half first half after the linear introduction of his origin to that of present day  which was great was wellfull of expositions that was somewhat weirdly edited to intertwine both present and past it happens kinda often that it really took me out of the storytelling being able to mentally recall the last time it did that it just felt repetitive and overuseand speaking of repetitiveness  that michael bay 360 camera rotation technique is just ernot good at all if i recall correctly  it is used like three times for first half of the movie and then there are those character building time scenes that was suddenly disrupted to lead into the action scenes  that got very repetitive too basically  it feels like the rhythm of the edit was very jarringeven the sounds got abruptly cut off as the camera pans up from the drumming octopus to those in the lobby deck  was a very weird choice instead of having it naturally fade out and there is that one scene with black manta and a song playing full on that felt so out of pace and out of placebesides all the technicalities above after all the setups once arthur and mera finally went on their expedition  that was when the movie kicked into another gear it became a story that i found interest in that was more enjoyable both jason momoa and amber heard exudes a believable chemistry and black manta was comic book perfection  to make his look work onscreen too and i felt the heart of the movie  when he met with his mom his brother meeting his mom and lastly his dad meeting his wife  those were very nice touchesanyways this film makes it cool to want to talk to a fish,fantasy
since a lot has been said already the story isnt as bad as everyone claims it is and the character development couldve been improved i personally loved the story since it told a great adventure the visuals are one of the best ive seen and the actors are also great the music is beautiful and fits perfectly into every scene if you want to watch a visually stunning superhero movie with great music and a well written story you will probably like this movie and as i said i dont know what issue some people here have but the movie is by far not as bad as they claim,fantasy
eh there was a lot of good in this but there was also a lot of bad and as an overall movie it didnt hit me the way it should have the visuals were awesome is likable and badass the musical score was great but the story was forgettable the villains were underwhelming there were so many cheesy and corny parts there were a bunch of smh moments and a lame highschooldramalevel romance i was close to giving it a 610 but the overall tone of this movie turned me off a bit 1 viewing,fantasy
the movie was really good and the action was superall thr cast are fit for this movie,fantasy
great characters and great history from love to action then drama is just one of the best movies mc ever had i cant wait to see the next one,fantasy
a more perfect cast couldnt have been put together for this movie amber heard is the most beautiful creature on land or in the sea even with orange hair or wet hair she is so stunning that she eclipses all the action going on around her her character mera is no damsel in distress either so happy she finally has a worldwide audience for her legendary beauty jason momoa is has the build and the hybrid looking eyes that comic book creators could only have dreamt of who else could be more suited to the role of there something a little tongue in cheek in his personality that helps too the multi talented patrick wilson as evil brother shows how versatile he is jumping from other wan movies like conjuring to this superhero movie effortlessly nicole kidmans towering height has finally been put to good use as queen of atlantisthe visuals are also beautiful beyond expectations when there is too much in the sea there is some interesting surface action too the satisfying and epic story has remains easy to follow from start to finish  marvel movies could learn from dc herea standard bearer for the future of action hero movies,fantasy
the movie is visually great but overall very poorly made characters are not well developed storyline seems to be a version of black panther dialogues are poor i am not sure should i fault the actors for the pitiful acting or the director,fantasy
this was really awful my 15 year old son and i wanted to walk out of the movie but stayedthere were two kids sitting next to me about ten years old at the credits they went best movie everpretty clear this is kids moviequestionhow many stopandturnyourheadandletyourhairswirl scenes do we need,fantasy
dont understand how so many love this movieyes the action sequences and visuals are cool but all the other aspects of the movie are boring how does one leave the cinema satisfied if only the visual aspect of the movie is fine,fantasy
this movie is amazing but i cant watch because not available in my country our cinema that meets the world standards but will not show that information came to our cinema,fantasy
how the heck is this getting ratings of 8 9 and 10 i mean i wanted to like it  jason momoa is a likeable character in the film  but the writing was just so bad like super cheesy i was pretty disappointed in the cgi as well everything looked so incredibly fake  just over the top the costumes were super lame and the movie was way too long okay ill stop there im giving it a 4 because despite its lameness i have to admit it was still pretty entertaining ha,fantasy
my mind was blown with how amazing this film was absolutely insane cgi probably the best in any comic book movie the character development and motivation for these characters in the film is so believable black manta was one of the best parts he didnt feel out of place or rushed in to have an extra villain to push the run time i love this film best origin hero film yet,fantasy
simply manta looks like one of the bad guys from the power rangers tv show,fantasy
 has loads of spectacle and loads of color  all the way down to meras ultrared hair in that one way its the polar opposite of the dark and glum batman v superman or suicide squad director james wan has decided to throw the kitchen sink at us with giant armored sharks supergiant weaponized crabs fleets of manta rays armies of mermen magic tridents and even wilder fantasy flights of imagination what makes this work which it pretty much does is that it has the big advantage of being new we havent seen this before by comparison with any other actiondriven movies that are usually on the surface world as the atlanteans refer to itbut as writer ursula leguin once said if the only thing happening is unrelenting physical action then its a sure sign that there is no story being told and thats where teeters on the edge its got a storyline which is actually quite simple and barely adequate to support all the action but in a sense the real center of interest is the spectacle itself largely because of its new and unfamiliar setting the overall feeling i got was that i was watching some kind of stylistic combination of raiders of the lost ark pacific rim star wars and king arthur all piled together my adult daughter says its like a cross between tron and little mermaidabout the acting jason momoa is  ok maybe a promise for better things to come he and all the rest suffer from having to deliver a pretty simplistic script with stereotype dialog i was generally pleased with amber heard as mera she got more to do than i was expecting and they gave her a distinctive watercontrol superpower that was fun to see and came in handy at certain points patrick wilson and willem dafoe stood clearly above all the rest however just for their quality of diction ie they didnt mumble why has slurring your words become a style as a last comment i thought rupert gregsonwilliams musical score was kind of a disappointment it was workmanlike and did the job needed for an epic like this essentially telling us how to feel at every moment but it was nowhere near the standout work he did for wonder womanbottom line is that youll get your moneys worth for an evenings entertainment for worlds of dc its a step up in production values now lets just add some serious storytelling to go with it,fantasy
this movie just blew me awaythis is without a doubt the best and the freshest superhero movie from the past decade jason momoa is henry cavill and ben affleck fit perfectly but never did i think that jason momoa would fit the character sooo perfectly the cgi is beyond perfect james wan has created an epic movie which fits perfectly with the dceu it had been quite some time since i have been this excited in the theaterdc has again proved to be a force to be reckoned with take a bow ,fantasy
i never write a review before but i write this review because the so called criticus review doesnt do justice on this movie 97 people liked this movie on google means the rotten tomatoes or metacritic criticus should retire because they dont understand what a good movie is shame on the fake criticuswatched it on imax 3d and i couldnt ask for more the movie is fresh and unique not like most of the superhero movie that has a same formula and tone every scene of this movie took my attentionthe characters are wellcasted and each have a background story the plot is solid the visual is stunning the music is really great skylar grey is so talented yet underratedits been a week and i still can remember the scene and details because it was remarkable,fantasy
believe me this movie is the best dceu so far dont believe the others reviews that five lower rating its a very fun movie,fantasy
the best parts of this almost christmas time heart warming movie for me weremusic original score is fresh and moving just like thor 3 ragnarok scorethe jukebox songs work very gwell placed black manta doing tony starks thing with the sounds of depeche mode its no good roy orbison and totos africa with rap  thats a combination old palthe first songtheme in the movie is some kind of atlantean lullaby  you can cry a sea of tears its very romanticviuals this is eyecandy  thats allmomoa and lundgren are great black pirates are cool main antagonist is charismatic and deep there are some really good jokes in marvel stylenow lets talk about weak partsthe plot is too big for one movie in my opinion hollow earths sea and dr auaman jones in sahara were thin and rawsame thing with black manta and the city of atlantis i would love to see him walking around the underwater streets watching simple alien life etc all this glory didnt fit the screen time lord of the rings was too fast and rushed too but is like 10 times faster maybe they will add some cut material in dvd versionsso i cant give it 10 of 10 but i give strong 9 for the great work and heart,fantasy
one word amazing never fails to amazed me from beginning until the end thanks to dir james wancongratulations cant wait for the next dc movie from you sir thank u,fantasy
really nice movie a great start a great development and a great final,fantasy
mantap ini film lanjutkan james wan untuk dc,fantasy
 is the new superhero film from the house of dc comics,fantasy
no need to give more compliments because it is so good,fantasy
watched it yesterday at amc 14 saratoga the movie was just amazing thanks to amazon,fantasy
i came to the cinema with no expectations left it so overwelmed with joy happines spiritualy filled everything was perfect the music casting dialogs animations movie tone such an epic movie i cried 3 times or more congrats again,fantasy
the best dc movie so far but there hasnt been much competition,fantasy
visuals are so charismatic and mesmerizingcgi works are really appreciablein whole moviei cant able to make a bond with characters because of weak screenplay and story tellingunnecessary scenes are occupied half of the movie prominent scenes are too shortbut i didnt get boredits really adventurousanyway watch it in theatres for experience a new world,fantasy
firstly things i liked action acting gfx cinematographyhowever the overall package failed to impress due to the overly futuristic portrayal of the underwater world seemed like an outer space setup and the nonuniqueness of the storymost people from my country have already seen bahubali  the beginning and are kinda aware of the story im wondering wow is story line any differentno spoiler alerts but youl know when if you go and watch the movie yourself i bet youll come out linking characters with bahubalis just for funid give it 610 and recommend you watch only for the gfx and some of the action sequences,fantasy
this is easily the best movie in the dceu so far with a pretty round script fun action and visuals not too derivative from snyders usual messhowever since neither the director nor the protagonist are female i must say this is still inferior to wonder woman and give it a 610,fantasy
jl was far better the plot was kiddy the acting was non existent perhaps this storyline would have faired better if made 4 an animated viewing,fantasy
this movie was funny action packed wholesome beautiful and fun jason mamoa is the perfect hero for this film and amber heard is and i quote the most beautiful woman alive it was so colorful and beautiful in the underwater scenes so much detail and perfection in every shot you want action and beauty check this movie out cant wait for part 2,fantasy
whilst i can appreciate the cgi i cant get past the poor storyline and predictable endingif i wasnt with company i would have leftdont waste your time or money,fantasy
i have mixed response after watching this flick first the visualsi watched in imax with laser and it was nice this resulted in bright images especially the oceans projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high 65 feet wide screen of imax completely using the whole screen with no chopping the picture the images are larger than life but they dont confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience along with 12000 watts imax proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing in a nutshell a picasso masterpiece of visualswhere is the character development and wheres the mission the first half was nice especially the script falls flat it was more like slaughterman to me i mean what was weakness to begin with black mantas father shot him with a launcher and it seemed that it bothered like a mosquito bite seriously if manta was not part of the movie it would have been worsefor superman it is kryptonite then why was punched and ko in justice league at least there was a twist in the middle of jlor pure female fantasy i mean it was nice that meeras character was not portrayed as a damsel in distress she was looking sexy in the tight suit but why forced feminism why did atlanna cry when both brothers were fighting rather she just saw her son going to bars without a tear in her eye arthur and meera going to africa and italy seemed like they were planning on a honeymoonverdict avatartronstar wars20my score is 4510 but i will add 05 since the visuals were far much better than bvs and jl and i watched the dark knight as it commemorated a decade recently no dcmarvel movie has even came close to that masterpiece sighrajnikanth can do everything and anything and is no different,fantasy
 is directed by james wan and is the 6th movie in the controversial dceulets start with the positives the acting all around is excellent jason momoa is an excellent and the action scenes are some of the best ive seen from a comic book movie in a long time another good thing going for this movie is that its very selfcontained its no batman v superman or suicide squad it doesnt try to set up 23 spinoff movies which dc movies are sometimes known for the villains werent half bad you could understand them and they werent evil for the sake of being evil finally james wan creates a fantastic world which for me wasbreathtaking at timesbut that doesnt mean there arent negatives the movie is clocking around 2 hours and 23 minutes and you can feel it there were so many scenes that were unnecessary and so many of the jokes just fell flat and didnt land with me or the audience that i was with besides the action scenes everything was lackluster the arthur and mera relationship was cringy at times but thats not something thats going to ruin the movie for you is also very predictable which takes the fun and suspense out during certain moments of the filma film with great acting excellent fights and a fantastic setting are ultimately brought down by its dragged on runtime bad jokes and uneventfulunnecessary scenes gets a 610,fantasy
one of the best movie of the dceu it brings romanceaction and humour to the film the special effect and the action scenes were mindblowing definitely worth seeing,fantasy
 is fun and enjoyable movie that everyone will likejames wan one of the best horror director did a great job in here  now i think dc is giving some fun movies like marvel becoz from long time dc was not giving good movies and now we finally got itthe story of the movie is very interesting with twist and turns packed with some ocassional humorsunlike other dc movies is fun and interesting to watch and less dark than other moviesthe one thing i liked the most about this film is powerful visuals effects that are pleasant and relaxing to watch  i think this movie has one of the best vfx and cgi i have seen in recent years  the underwater world looks very bright and colors are overwhelming but in good sensei would highly recommend this movie to everyone,fantasy
very short review requiredpoor on all levelsa waste of two and a half hours of your life,fantasy
the movie was of poor quality with an overload of cgi and humor that was forced into it the dc movies should try to stay more serious and nowhere in the stories was he a jokster of any kind even the story made no sense spoiler alert this movie is terrible and i fell asleep twice watching it,fantasy
i felt i was rewatching king arthur ft ariel from the little mermaid with touches of star wars under the sea wrath of the titans sparkles of ff5 and some other movies jason mamoa plays a much too cool of an wich makes the film entertaining at leastover 30 years of comics and they couldnt deliver a plot its writen use the material you already have dc,fantasy
great from the beginning til the after credits scene not sure why its getting mediocre reviews as it honestly keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time,fantasy
better edited and paced than infinity war can ever hope to be,fantasy
i was too exited to speak after watching the filmdceu is rising,fantasy
james wan is taking his patrick wilson out of horror films effects are stunning,fantasy
i went to cinema to watch this just for the visuals expecting plotscript to be meh well visuals cinematography action and design were great i watched it in 3d as expected plot was simple cliche script weak i laughed so many times after each corny line the characters delivered i didnt like the music either fun to watch ww is better,fantasy
make no mistake about it this is one of the best dcu movies out there jason delivers a solid performance true to the justice league ruffian of the previous movie what drags it down is actually the storyline itself you never fully get to understand arthurs drive and even less so the supporting characters and the middle act is slow and the indiana jonesesque hunt for clues seem out of placean overall good popcorn movie definitely worth seeing the formular is not quite there but close and it might just be the spark that can lit the dcu againand trailer fanboys will be disappointed to find out that the trailer music was just that and not featured in the movie ,fantasy
the film is unreasonable  terrible  worth more than 10 starsthank you for this great time,fantasy
first off i just want to say that i really enjoyed james wans i also thought director james wan did an outstanding job making and taking a superhero out of a popular dc comic book icon superhero named and turning it into awesome movie and by casting jason momoa to play arthur curry aka was the perfect choice to play this underwater comic book hero and the way the james wan came up with some terrific action sequences the beautiful scenery set pieces with excellent exotic locations especially the action scene that takes place in italy and the all star cast that includes amber heard william dafoe patrick wilson temuera morrison nicole kidman and dolph lundgren were brilliant the verdict jason momoa was cool and bad ass as im not a fan of amber heard films but i have to say i thought she did great job of playing this hero character named mera especially her and are helping each other out also by having them saving the day and the two of them also share a kissing scene patrick wilson from zach snyders dark superhero film watchmen where he plays the nite owl character also he has started in two of insidious films and two of the conjuring films in he plays evil half brother named king orm who wants to rule the entire underwater atlantis and of becoming the ultimate king of atlantis which was a pretty good bad guy character to play tamuera morrison from star wars episode 2  the attack of the clones where he played the bounty hunter character named jango fitt in he plays arthur currys father which was cool to see him again in a movie then we three big superstars like nicole kidman who plays mother named atlanna who has a bad ass action moment sequence scene it was to see her play a defferent kind of character role the always great william dafoe from speed 2 cruise control the first john wick film and my favorite film in oliver stones platoon where in he plays vulko who is mentor and teaching him of how to learn of fighting and showing him of using powers to speak to underwater sea creatures and finally theres action icon star dolph lundgren who plays king nereus whos also meras father now for me i thought he was awesome to see in an superhero action film for the first time well not since he first played the frank castle aka the punisher character in 1989s the punisher way a go james wan for coming off of directing the supernatural and suspense films like the conjuring and the insidious films also making of the first saw movie and the puppet fright film dead silence once again this was a defferent kind of an james wan movie and i think he should make more action and superhero films because he has a good eye for making these kind of movies with style coming up with these imagination ideas and a amazing direction,fantasy
overall not sure about this film will have to rewatch but here are my first impressions started well apart from atlanna tridenting the classic puppet series stingray theyre the good guys atlanna enjoyed meeting big boy whilst taking on mantawas a pretty cool opening action sequence after that it got a little too much with excessive cgi and really too much going on for a single viewing dafoe was ok but not enough mentoring for my taste plot was overall ok except for the duel with orm was not getting his ass kicked to hard so seemed a bit cowardly to run away with mera tended towards the cheesy in closing sequences but i will watch again to see what subtleties i may have missed in the crowded action sequencies momoa was very good in the part liked him since stargate atlantis and obviously as badass khal drogo in the butchered got others fitted in well even an obviously aging kidman check out the facial wrinkles that werent covered well i liked it on the whole and i am sure it will improve with each additional viewing hope you liked it too,fantasy
was it a movie or an agitated nightmare  imagine throwing star wars lord of the rings  fast and furious  indiana jones black widow and many other ideas into a blender the result will be anything but a comprehensive movieit is a pure dui directing under influenceup until a few years ago  i was a fan of dc but im beginning to lose hope as ive been constantly disappointed by every dc movie since dark knightlack of a reasonable and logical screenplay destroyed the big budget and wasted the ambitions of this movieat the end  i can confess that there were two positives that nailed me to my seat sound editing and cinematography which were both oscar worthydc awaken,fantasy
im 32 yo and i believe that im to old for this kind of movies not much of a plot but fast and colorful i dont think im going to watch any more comic based movies now children and adolescents will enjoy it more,fantasy
a bit of something for everyone in this great for the kids and plenty of eye candy for both parents with the typical dc comic storyline plenty of action and a happy ending,fantasy
one of the worst superhero films out there and no surprise its another from dc a vast improvement on justice league its not much of a step up from rock bottom its at times unreasonable to expect realism from this type of film but ive never ever seen an outing thats looked so fan made or cheap as this the non cgi costumes characters etc look horrendous and theres two or three fairly big scale action sequences which are visually quite big moments but are vastly over crowded and just blur into a multi coloured mess overly long at nearly 2 and a half hours its got no right to be so long and does seem to have moments where the foot is taken off the gas and becomes stagnant only positives to come from this are clearly momoa and dafoe who seem genuinely happy to be involved and perform quite well other than that it couldve been handled differently over multiple films maybe to be more impactful has similarities to the first thor film but as you know by now the way these two franchises have been handled is vastly different and such is a toothless and dull release,fantasy
 mamoa has to take time out from drinking and bumming around and beat bad guy wilson to stop him waging war and become king of all things wet he is ably assisted by amber heardfun and colourful whilst this is not as good as wonder woman it is leagues better 20000 than snyders dark grim and rather dull efforts this far mamoa and heard are a good double act and whilst the cgi and hero music is a little over done there remains plenty to enjoy,fantasy
even if i was seven which im not this film would bore me full of adult themes and not enough fantasy to entertain children its a mish mash of watery beings that come on land but to do nothing else but piss land dwellers off they get reckless hahaha then piss off back to the depths of the pacific i can only hope this is not a kids film lucky for me i only endured roughly 30 minutes adious,fantasy
predictable plot  yet beautiful cgi and good action sequences  for a dc superhero movie standard this is way better,fantasy
 let me put it this way wonder woman  rank 1  rank 2 batman v superman  3 man of steel  4 and justice league  5 so now you know this is a must watchthe storyline is pretty much a copypaste from the animated world so much is predictable the cgi is pretty good the designer might have got lazy here and there i was blown away at how they managed to do a few things wont say its a spoiler and fit it so well in the storylinejason momoa this huge beast is the best thing there is in the movie the underwater cgi version of him is 810 amber heard did a pretty good come backdc has pretty good characters but screenplaywriters not all are great it is clearly visible that the pressure from marvel has made them rush this did not end well for rank 3 and 5 wonderwoman and are the key reason why dc is still afloat maybe this says dc should have done what marvel did story out each character and then fit them like avengers justice league is this casepeace out,fantasy
im not sure why i waited so long to actually watch this but i gave it 7 stars because of jason momoa and that is the only reason its not the worst superhero movie ive ever seen and its definitely not the best either willem dafoes hair is hysterical amber heard acts as if shes part robot part alien while some of it was visually appealing i laughed my a off at other things that werent meant to be funny all the actors performances except for jason were way over the top and ridiculous at times,fantasy
this is my favorite dceu film so before justice league like most people i thought was lame then jl came out and he was a little cool but we didnt get much of him and then this film comes out and it was such a fun ride so the characters are all great jason mamoa plays a better than the comic version amber heard played a good mera and her chemistry with arthur was definitely there and you could see it with the scenes they had together black manta was also amazing he had great motives and a sick suit and although we didnt get much of him he was still a great antagonist and then there is ocean master who was good but i feel we shouldve gotten a little more of him but patrick wilson does a great job of playing the character the action is awesome the atlantis battle was beautiful in fact atlantis was beautiful the entire film the fight scene against black manta that chase scene was cool as well the story is also good a man in both worlds tries to just leave himself out of the conflict but in the end he has to become a son of the land  a king of the seas and that entire journey throughout this movie was interesting last that ending was beautiful as arthur finally realizes his place in this world and that realization was so satisfying overall a fun movie with great characters and a good story and i cant wait what dc has in store for the sequel,fantasy
why so many negative reviews this film was fast paced action and i loved it will look forward to the follow up,fantasy
i can honestly say that i always find something good in a movie why so called serious movie critics lambaste a movie is beyond me the cgi were over the top but incredibly entertaining i watched two movies on a flight home from bucharest and wished i hadnt have waited to see this one i didnt want to waste my time watching a movie that others had given such a low score to shame on you you so called movie fans,fantasy
this was one of the better ones but thats not saying much considering some of the messes lately in this genre first of all i dont care about mcu vs dc and i dont think im alone in that regard what most people want is a good captivating entertaining movie periodthis one had great elements  directing was good visuals pretty well done considering and i did find the main lead actor playing entertaining but and this is a very very big but aside from him the worst acting ive seen in a long time amber heard was awful i mean i couldnt even stay in the plot when i saw her on screen  i just kept thinking about her being elon musks ex thats pretty far off from the movies plot is she supposed to be a beauty because aside from a little cleavage theres just nothing going for her in my opinion nicole kidman a little better but not great and the 2 main evil opponents dont even get me started either just bad,fantasy
no amount of action cgi or goodlooking actors can hide horrible writing the plot and dialogue was neither believable or entertaining it baffles me how this script was ever approved i really struggled to even finish this film in terms of acting momoa has a great performance however everyone else was hugely lacking dont waste your time with this one,fantasy
the only reason some people believe this movie made sense was that it tried to follow every cliche of other poorly written superhero movie ever created other than that it made absolutely no sense first of all the sea peoplearmy men came after the mom like 45 years after she went missing ok then it just randomly jumps to just knowing hes a superhero and can breath underwater somehow and attacking submarines ok then theres random evil submarine men who just show up and start shooting at the sea people having a meeting why did they know they were there having a meeting why are they attacking them so random not to mention looks absolutely nothing like his supposed parents and he looks about 510 years younger than his dad the acting terrible plot terrible music terrible even the costumes were terribletrust me do not bother with this youd think since no one has made an movie before theyd at least try since we already have about 800 spiderman and batman movies but no whoever wrote this has just completely given up,fantasy
 is such a good movie it had fantastic actors jaw dropping underwater cgi and amazing characters ive never seen anything that jason momoa act before but this movie was great match for him i cant to see future dc movies if theyre going be as awesome as this,fantasy
great superhero movie trying to rate it on anything else is worthless i was entertained and i think that is the main point,fantasy
well i not watched this movie in cinema but i can feel the pain its really pain in the ass to survive 230 hrs of torture i like the lead actors and cgi also good but it should be 120 hrs enough there is not story and everything expected whats going next its just one time watch but my type of person cant sit and watch 230 hrs long movie like this,fantasy
im looking forward to the next installment great entertainment,fantasy
 was better than i expected while the special effects are out there they do seem some what believable all the sea creatures that are used for transportation was cool as well as the battle between arthur and the black manta the black manta seemed like a side plot that didnt need to be there but i guess he will come into play with the sequel i dont think the acting was very good jason momoa and amber heard just didnt give much emotion and their funny scenes fell flat but you arent watching this for the acting but for the actionfinal verdict one of the better marvel films its a fun ride,fantasy
finally james wan an aussie and jason mamoa have made coolif only he was around when raj on big bang theory kept drawing the cosplay short straw,fantasy
i was pist i rented this silliness to be fair i had low expectations but they should have been expectations of total boredom and stupidity and bad effects and terrible acting not sure how this made so much money except the lead actor is super hot and kids will love the action but as a comic movie this one is beyond disappointing i kept thinking of dr evil and his request for freakn sharks with lasers in finger quotes,fantasy
plot summarya protagonist with claim to an advanced secret kingdom challenges the primary antagonist for the throne but is defeated the primary antagonist wants to wage war on the unknowing outside world using advanced technology to free his people from the wrongs done by everyone else after the initial defeat the protagonist does some soul searching comes to terms with their issues and returns to defeat the primary antagonistother notable characteristics of the filmvirtually everyone in the film is of the same ethnicity except for a secondary antagonist and a couple others the secondary antagonist serves no real purpose except being used by the the primary antagonist as basically a distraction and additional action for the filmwhat movie did i just describe or black panther and dont get me wrong the movie was fun to watcheasily one of if not the best dcu films to date when it was released but of the 710 rating i gave it 5 belong to black panther,fantasy
this was the most visually stunning movies of all time since james wann is envolved it can have extremely intense scary thrilling sequences i will admit its a little long but thats not a huge problem,fantasy
i felt like there was a big part missing of the story because there was so little information it did entertain me for beginning to end seeing something that i havent seen before maybe underwater it got to look a little fake but it didnt bother me too too much i wouldnt watch again the movie wasnt that good that i lost track of time,fantasy
overall i thought this was a fun movie the special effects were really good atlantis was beautiful and jason mamoa did an excellent job as i mean we all know was one of the lamest superfriends but whos really gonna mess with this version of majority of the cast were great in their parts but amber heard just irked me throughout the movie to me her acting was doing a bad impersonation of black widow and her hair looked like a wig i was waiting for it to float off of her head the movie does have some superhero movie cliches like they stop to kiss literally in the middle of the huge final battle scene insert eye roll but i am looking forward to the sequel just hopefully with a lot less amber heard or better yet recasting someone else in the mera role,fantasy
one more meh movie from dc if they continue to realease movies im going to watch them but cmom the story is already written just choose a good one,fantasy
damm this is second best bc film its just cgi mess with a boring story line the only good part is jason mommoa,fantasy
one of the worst films ever cannot believe it made it to 71acting plot costumes fx so bad then copies all over indiana jones star wars tron pacific rim and even good old dark crystal is in this mess,fantasy
im not a girl so when you subtract the whole hes so dreamy deal from the equation you end up with wasting over an hour trying to pay attention to the crap storyline while watching way too much special effects that probably cost more to do than the movie will ever compensate for i went to a theater with the whole snow rain smells experience to enhance the experience and it made it worse having air blown into my eardrums every time he waved around his pussy trident weapon ,fantasy
unless your iq is in the double digits which would likely preclude you from even realizing as such  oh the irony avoid this movie at all costs zero substance or plot depth terribly cliche dialogue horrible acting the 3 stars are merely for the visually rich cg that notwithstanding i just lost 2 hours of my lifeyet another reminder of just how remedial the general population is that this movie has an average rating of 7 along with several 9s  10s defies logic utter garbage,fantasy
watching this movie was nothing short of painful and it wasnt long in until i was asking myself if ive ever actually got up and walked out of a movie it was tempting i decided to stay to see if it would actually go anywhere turns out its one of the worst ever the only barely redeeming value was the fact that they had a couple of major stars in nicole kidman and willam defoe i have no idea why either would take part in such a ridiculous venture perhaps it was flattering to have any evidence of aging removed and it was a digital facelift for bothlike many of its superhero predecessors it is so over done on constant unrelenting action violence and cgi that it rapidly became a real snoozer though impossible to actually fall asleepthis movie is also not for children if you dont want your child exposed to this sort of thing then leave them home there was one 7 year old seen covering his ears and ended up on his fathers lap please do your children and yourself a favormany here cite the fact that it was a ripoff from so many other stories but the silliest reference of them all was that to king arthur as he pulled the trident from its impossibletoremove resting place oh brother please dont insult such wonderful fictional legendsif you need someone with a killer body in your hero please do so with an actual actor someone who can run with the big boysthis movie has no redeeming value whatsoever isnt that what were looking for in the genre,fantasy
the usual saturday night at the movies with your date teen flickmeaning heaving more eyes for your date then the movie itselfwhich results in giving this movie a higher rating then it deserves because heylove makes you blind and doesnt make you think too clearlyme as someone in his 40s needs a little more story and character development instead of this mindless by the book visual eyecandyi just dont care anymore how beautiful it all looks when everything else is weakbut what really ruined it for me is how the treated the being underwater itselfi know its hard and near to impossible to do but everyone who has ever seen a persons face underwater especially with his or her eyes openknows it looks totally different then shown here the underwater waving hairs and costumes cant compensate for that,fantasy
poor crap boring turned the movie off after 20 minutes yawn,fantasy
i really wanted to love this film great actors but the weak story and writing leave it falling way short of expectation as great as the visual effects are theres just too much happening in the under water scenes it makes for a muddled and confusing cinema experience and dulls the sparkle of the attractive and talented cast,fantasy
despite the harsh criticisms that the cinematic universe of dc has received over the last few years they have managed to remain stable and again and again have tried to meet the expectations of their audience yet again and again failed now as for it seems to be a green light to a ray of hope for the future of these movies because they finally offer us something that is both entertaining and decent without mediocrity or folly is an entertaining movie full of intense moments designed to satisfy our eyes through a pretty cinematography and a great choreography this but a soundtrack quite attractive that manages to help the scenes are quite satisfactory to our senses well at least the action scenesleaving the action on one side i think that the rest of the film during the moments when nobody is fighting are then boring full of dialogues and performances that sincerely do not contribute anything to the importance we have on these characters his narrative is full of the cliches expected in any film however it is something forgivable but reaches a point where we simply want a break from observing the same thing over and over again during these dialoguing scenes i think this is the weak point of the film in contrast to the very good action it has it lacks a strong narrative or structure in which we can be interested enough about the story of the film the motives of the characters or the characters themselvesin spite of this it is finally a healthy and wellreceived attempt in the action genre apart from a good movement on the part of dc although the movie was entertaining the reality is that it was simply good nothing outstanding or anything excellent but even so it is worth having a look at it if someone is interested in the dc film universe this is probably their best movie,fantasy
and i mean this in both ways  good and badfirst the bad its way too long that desert scene was really trash some music choices were questionable to say the leastbut here comes the good jason momoa rocks men on sea horses sounds stupid but works quite well dolph lundgren some really great shots and the overall feeling of a beautifully cheesy fairy tale and the best thing this movie doesnt take itself more seriously than it shouldsure  it could have been no should have been way shorter and it would have made the movie much better but if james wan has proven anything with this flick it is that you can tell the most cheesy story for the thousandth time  and it will still work if you tell it welli enjoyed this way more than i thought i would,fantasy
cgi is the real star of this film and it gets on your nerves fast if youre used to watching real people and real things happening i honestly would rather play a video game than watch this i definitely feel like it would be more fun for sure dolph lundgren is fun to see though watch if you like cgi,fantasy
too many cringeworthy moments and saying stuff that would be funny in 2005 mera contradicting herself sometimes like youre the true king then later if youre the true king were doomed like wtf,fantasy
one of the most infamous films to come out of the dc extended universe in definitely justice league due to its messy structure and clear behind the scenes meddling that being said what followed up could very well be their most creative endeavor yet and that is the cinematic stand alone flick centered around it also happens to be the only addition to this franchise that grossed over a billion dollars worldwide after finally having watched it i must say that it is arguably their most epic and rad flick they have made thus farthe main storyline revolves around aka arthur curry who is the heir to the underwater kingdom called atlantis however he is destined to step forward to lead his people against his halfbrother orm who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world from that premise alone the film has a very predictable narrative and its not hard to figure out what happens throughout the runtime in addition the film has a rather pointless subplot centering on black manta seeking revenge towards and it barely has much connection to the progression of the film as a whole also many of the other characters are twodimensional at best arthurs relationship with meta lacks the proper chemistry needed for a romantic arch and the film may really didnt need to be nearly 25 hourshowever where the film may lack in originality it more than ever makes up with a huge epic scale and some amazing action it really feels as if director james wan was having a field day with all the different set pieces the film displays from the underwater regions to the vast sahara desert to the coastal villages of italy and more the overall scope of the film really creates the feeling that were are viewing an epic globetrotting adventure not to mention the cgi is highly imaginative and the vast amount of creature designs are enough to inspire plenty of animators and visual effects artists all these different areas and monsters the film plays around with make me feel like im experiencing something out of this world something that even some of the best superhero movies dont offernow admittedly the film does feature unnecessary slow mo angles like the former dc films but at least they dont rely on it also most of the acting is relatively good even down to jason mamoa seemingly having fun with his character willem dafoe patrick wilson temeura morrison and nicole kidman are serviceable enough whereas the likes of amber heard and dolph lundgren seem like theyre underacting and even the younger actors playing past forms of come off as laughably bad more often than not trying to act bold and stoic doesnt really lead to an appropriately convincing performance but then again this movie isnt even about oscar worthy performances if anything that oscar goes to the catchy and upbeat rendition of africa by pitbullnever in my life would i think id be enjoying a movie from this franchise solely out of its production values and creativity than the actual story despite its cliched storyline and hit or miss characters might be the most entertaining dceu venture next to shazam although this one is more entertaining from how nutty it all is where shazam was amusing and fun intentionally this film creates such a crazy world of its own that it might as well be in the history books of biggest blockbuster superhero hits even if youre not a dc fan i would actually recommend this movie due to the epic scope and highly imaginative visual aesthetic it may be more brawn than brains but as pure campy popcorn delight you wont be disappointed at all,fantasy
it was goodokthe only thing i didnt enjoy was the one villain looked and moved like a character straight out of the power rangers moviebesides that a fun watch,fantasy
the dc extended universe hasnt been very good so everyone was building on their hype on this movie after the awful justice leaguei saw this film and its just okay its not very good and its not very bad the things i liked about itblack manta one of the only dceu archenemy villains that they get right i love the improvements on his suit design and how tough and intimidating he was the lasers that shot out of his eyes were very coolmera even though amber heard is not a redhead she still was a good leading lady role and i wonder why movies like this in the dceu have better love interest roles than man of steel and supermans my favorite dc herothe things i dislikedblack manta i liked manta but some of him seemed like a killmonger knock off with the story of his dad and his vendetta against also the fact that he wasnt the main villain was a disappointment he only had 19 minutes of screen timethe humor i believe it was a worthy thing for them to try and brighten up the dceu with humor but when you think about the universe that these movies exist in it seems sudden and out of placethat being said its definitely not a movie i would buy on bluray but its a better entry in the dc extended universe ill give warner bros that,fantasy
director james wan intended this film to be an high level superhero movie one who could reestablish dc status as far as movies it can be seen by his camera movements forcedly ingenious that felt like he wanted to show how good he is as a director the problem is that this feeling is not received with numerous scenes that were annoying to watch and one in particular where the camera is moving excessively fast where i felt a bit of nausea the direction was not all bad indeed at the beginning of the third act there is a really beautiful scene that shows wans history in the horror genereanother bad aspect of this movie was the cgi the underwater setting was way distant to seem a bit realistic with a lot of light effects so artificial that were disturbing to watch in a 2019 moviealso the plot was not that good very linear with some plot holes but in the grand scheme of the film it could have been acceptable if not for a narrative pattern overused there are like 5 or 6 scene where the screenwriters didnt know how to start the action and so they decided to interrupt the dialogue between two or more characters with an explosion the first time is ok the second time you can accept it but when the third happens before the 40 minutes mark its not good also the lenght was a bit excessive like a half an hour could be spearedbut why didnt i give a terrible rating less than 5 because at the end of the day it is an enjoyable film with some big big problems but that entertains yes you will probably feel that some things are not working but you wont leave the cinema in painin the end is formally a bad movie but it has the rare power of entertaining obviously not on an high level but its not a poor experience,fantasy
in the most recent years syfy original movies have actually been not only pallatable but somewhat engaging and worthy of praise has all the elements of the days of the early years of the horrible writing timing plot scripting i have seen since sharknado this seems to have been made as a serious film but who can take this seriously this is nothing more than the next chapter of sharknado,fantasy
1 star it was awful zero continuity couldnt follow what storyline they gave ilove jason mamoa but this was horrible,fantasy
amber heard is disgusting she poops in beds she is in most of this movie with a very large role couldnt act her way out of a paper bag gross just gross,fantasy
thiss an awesome movie though some of the scenes are implausible jason mamoa does a really good job playing the title character amber heards cool in the role of mera and the action scenes are really cool some of the effects look fake but otherwise are finethe storys about arthur king traveling to atlantis to claim the throne from his halfbrother orm who wants to use it to wage war against the dry land we inhabit helping him is mera and his former mentor nuidiswilliam dafoe i dont have much to say other than thiss a really good movie my only nitpicks are some of the scenes dont make sense though i guess you have to suspend your belief otherwise i highly recommend watching this movie,fantasy
the first 20 minutes is freaking awesome then the movie just keep going i just cant relax in the movie things happen all the time it never gets boring jason momoa plays the role of very welli read a lot of reviews that said this was not gonna be it but i cannot disagree more im not saying it is perfect but really not that bad as the reviews saidso my expectations on this one was not so high that is why i was a little surprised and positively overwhelmed 77,fantasy
man the dc movies are doing a good job of making good movies and awesome,fantasy
fascinating movie with stunning underwater effects and amazing performances by jason momoa amber heard nicole kidman and all cast the introductory scene to the character is breathtaking jason momoa fits the character better than any other actor in a super hero comic movie ever the plot is interesting with good sence of humour we give it a 10 loved it,fantasy
aqua man  awesome loved it  great movie  plot and spfx  but why oh why was that blackmanta bubbleheaded blunder included  and  hes going to be part of the sequel nooo ,fantasy
 is that movie you say wow in the movie more than oncethe movie had maybe everything in a superhero movie is the story was good the actors were amazing and the best thing is the action andthe director james wan was the heroand jason mamoa is,fantasy
 is the new role of dc i think the actor is really suit that movie first of all i had waited this movie since the trailer just release it almost continue 2h 30min but it feels like few moment i really deep into it it was great movie i have ever watched actually i had watched twice i cant stop loving this movie is the symbol of ocean and brave,fantasy
i watched this not to long ago and while i was watching really noticed the design flaws the suite she wears in the into is lazy editing and the whole movie seems to have a cheap budget it could have been great with the people they casted but they just lacked in funding for cgi therefore i cannot recommend this,fantasy
this review would have been higher but amber heard can not act how she was cast is beyond my comprehension the effects were great and jason momoa is great to look at but its all of action with little payoff,fantasy
im a big fan of superhero movies not caring whether it marvel or dc the movie has very good scenes lots of surprisingly good underwater battle scenes great action great choreography wonderful sets terrific battles all of the best we see how a character emerged and how he was a hero so i think story of this movie is perfect and amazing there are action adventure comedy incredible visuals great soundtrack emotion in this movie characters explainations is done in a perfect way dc did a amazing job with this movie and showed that there is more great movies to come you can feel the emotion of all the characters and the villains in this movie are so passionate that you really are rooting for them just as much as the hero himself its an outstanding movie loved it must watch,fantasy
this was a good and entertaining superhero movie but thats all there is i prefer dc when i read comics but i think they have a lot to work with when it comes to movies dc are taking the right direction with their movies though after superman v batman and justice league i think theyve learned a lot and are starting to make there solo movies to maybe make something greater later in their universeback to this movie i think the writing of the conversations are a bit poor im no filmmaker but i really got so little from arthur in this movie his lines was so short i wish we could see more character development event though this was a origin moviei also think there was a lot of cliche moments which i feel is typical dc to do the bullying part and the kissing in the middle of the battle to mention somelastly i think the cgi was too much i know this is under water but if marvel manage to make good thor and guardians movies with great cgi dc can do it to the cgi in this movie kind of reminded me of jl which was reeaally badas i said i feel like dc is on the right way but still a lot to work with when it comes to writing and cgi i havent seen shazam yet but so far ive heard only good things about it so maybe dc have learned,fantasy
summary a fresh and entertaining take on origin story not as great as wonder woman and has its flaws but that doesnt stop this movie from being a great actionpacked adventureentertainer that shouldnt be missedi put off watching this movie because i have already watched aq origin story perhaps more than once through dcs animated seriesmovies i am glad i tried this one anyway since this movie breathes fresh air into the characters and story and kept me captivated throughout even if it wasnt entirely perfectthe movie was generally quite well paced with the very first action scene getting me hooked into the story while also showcasing the power and glory of atlantis i liked momoas portrayal of aq which is quite impressive and liked that the humour aspect wasnt overused unlike in some marvel movies i liked that mera gets to play an important role and was with every step of the way i was worried if amber heard could handle such as important character but she didi also like how atlantis was crafted so beautifully for this movie the special effects the fight scenes the sheer scope of everything etc orm didnt get to do much this movie but i like that there are hints of more character depth to him i wouldnt mind seeing more of him and his motivations  how losing his mother feeling she betrayed him and then losing both his fiance and kingdom to the firstborn she seems to prefer etc drives himwhat i didnt like was manta ray his scenes just didnt work because the actor couldnt act to save his life he came across as childish and petulant and like a joke hope he gets recast the arc of aq where he grows to regret not saving his father also fell flat  everything seemed too random i also didnt like that a lot of the plot felt like a videogame complete with quests for the hero  even a lot of the dialogue sounded too direct simplistic and hollowoverall this is a great actionpacked and fun adventure entertainer that has to be watched despite its flaws,fantasy
it has a lot of money pumped into it and a lot of action its like 25 hours which i dont think id sit through again whats his face is nothing special,fantasy
so is basically the mos wanted of atlantis and in justice league he just strolls around like a walk in the park into supposedly atlantiss most precious and guarded areathen no atlantian army goes after their motherbox given they dont even know who the and the world may end but in this movie they do because reasons and 7 seasdceu shows us that they cant even get close to mcu not even by copying them,fantasy
the romance was not good it felt way too forced and didnt feel natural like they were thrown together which thats sort of exactly what happened the romance between his parents in the beginning of the movie is beautiful sweet and lovely so at least theres there the movie was fun action packed and the cgi was amazing i loved the movie very much and the concepts of the underwater world moving underwater talking underwater all super cool though i must admit why do they need underwater vehicles if they can literally swim just as quickly the scenes with the trench were incredible and very engaging everyone loves jason and that probably helps add a lot of the attraction to the movie it was a great movie and id recommend it,fantasy
this film was very entertaining effects story and acting although ropeycheesy sometimes what really made this and other super hero films of late bad for me is balancing the characters abilities or making things believeableiewhat is aqua man made of is he on par with superman all of his powers and more what are they i know they are fictional characters but you cant have them jump out of a plane at altitude and land without a parachute to then be punched and knocked out or hurt by a minor accident injury it was the same with the avengers films everyone knows that hulk is the most powerful super hero but on par with black widow or clint bartoncome onhe would tear them a new one you have to get it right or it ruins it far better balancing in the old cartoons or films i think they just going too far with effects and action and not thinking about the restgreat if your a kid with a small mind but im a big kid with a big mind get it right,fantasy
i enjoyed this movie very much it was really good i didnt get bored and i recommend it for everyone ,fantasy
say what you want but a beautiful story loved the graphics and it was pretty funny in a badass kinda way i love the fearlessness totally recommend,fantasy
the special effect is good or amazing it will bring you to a new world somewhere far from this normal world which youre living everyday jason is an awesome actor he did such a good job in this movie highly recommend,fantasy
once home to the most advanced civilization on earth the city of atlantis is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the powerhungry king orm with a vast army at his disposal orm plans to conquer the remaining oceanic people  and then the surface world standing in his way is orms halfhuman halfatlantean brother and true heir to the throne with help from royal counselor vulko must retrieve the legendary trident of atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deepin a better world would excel at delivering an ecological message to the masses but all the fish in the sea cantsalvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep for all its sporadic wackiness and wonder  on balance still comes out a bore but they have given it a heroic shake i liked the mum that came out of this movie very much i think thats a good movie,fantasy
noone could safely complain about this movie its got everything its got a tidal wave its got vicious sharks its got as much colour underwater as avatars forests have luminescence at night its got as much action as two bond movies and fantastic fight scene bashes it has endless fantastical locations underwater and awesome scenic locations on land it has better beasts than harry potter and it has better submarines than extraordinary gentlemen quiet moments are rare and in any case poignant the water graphics are amazing and often tasteful i really dont understand critics who deride this work as too over the top over the top is the job of movies and the wonder of our age if too much cgi bothers you you should pay for a theatre ticket instead what a relief this movie is i cant thank it enough for being all in a wondrous experience this is the sort of movie that easily sustains itself for over two jawdropping hours punters should try to see it on the best quality largest hd digital screen possible preferably on ultra 4d bluray buckle up,fantasy
this could have been a great movie but it lacked a good story it lacked an introduction and good dialogue from the very beginning we were just thrown into a battle between the two main characters and after that we were off into war the special effects and action were entertaining though and jason is handsome and charming as hell but unfortunately that is not enough to save the film so i score the film 6 out of 10ps they should have skipped the red wig it was too irritating to watch,fantasy
certainly dcs best movie in the franchise to date the costume design was top drawer and also the way under water world was created was great,fantasy
the acting was superb with the exception of patrick wilson who was merely adequate dolph lundgren who i often find to be a weak link in a cast was outstanding in his role as king nereusthe plot was a bit predictable but not so much that it hurt the movie overall lots of action scenes which were well done and plenty of humor throughout the cgi effects were well done but a bit too much of a neon effect in places atlantis was lit up like las vegaswhatever shortcomings the plot had the ending made up for it i regard as more of a fantasy movie than a super hero flick but there was plenty of heroism to go around ill watch it again im sure,fantasy
and really young ones at that i dont align with any particular cinematic universe and always hope for a good film whether the character is dc or marvel like many superhero fans i just keep hoping some dc characters will get the treatment they deserve this one is not even close horrible nonsensical dialogue no real characters at all and a lot of bad acting momoa is ok amber heard is laughable and the truly seasoned actors wilson dafoe kidman lundgren carry almost all of the acting weight stunning cgi though but nothing more,fantasy
 is a very fun and entertaining movie with a great cast but has too many story issues also a lot of the things aid or done in this movie is just stupid  610 c,fantasy
i dont give 10s easily but this movie was fantastic jason momoa was the perfect choice to play i wasnt crazy about amber heard patrick wilson or even nicole kidman but the movie was so good that i can overlook that the cgi was awesome and the story interesting i dont understand all the negative reviews my only regret is not seeing this on the big screen i bet it would have been amazing,fantasy
great cast patrick wilson and jason momoa especially great use of visuals and finally someone invested in a story for a comicbook genre moviebetter than most of the recent marvel offerings including aff wars and endgame,fantasy
watched about half the movie on blue ray and then switched it off luckily it was a 2 special rentalthe story was a yawnfest and the underwater vocals too weird to get used toi feel sorry for the cast who would have been doing their best in front of a green screen and unaware of how dire the end product was going to turn out,fantasy
it is this type of message and mentality that causes the sri lankas and aucklandsduality  takes sides violence black vs white thinking evil vs good the world is round but hollywood has to take sides perpetuating fighting and killing and competing and pridehorrid showi felt nothing but what a piece of junk it is and i compared it to new zealands waitit or whoeveracting was bad  writing tritethey all made a bundle of dough and can write checks to sri lankastuff like this is what suicide bombers watch before pulling a job but  in their minds they are the whites the rightsthere are only consequences and the consequence of films like this taken at all seriously or engaged in by people results in the idiofication of humanity,fantasy
what is the most popular hair style in atlantis if you guessed hair glossed back so they dont have to animate ityou guessed righttalk about lazy i dont remember falling asleep and yet i dont see how else i could have missed so muchreally i just want to know one thing why did the atlantians think that the shrimp people and the surface dwellers were the same people they said onward to the surface to destroy the surface dwellersright after saying this they dove down to the shrimp people and started attacking them,fantasy
marvel films for me have always been bright colorful and funny while the films of dc were dark serious to some extent brutal atmosphere that is how i divided these universes up to this time is interesting but very colorful romantic comedy with fireworks at the end was it really a dc movie,fantasy
cheesy bad dialogue and lazy storytelling how atlantas came to be under the sea was the most disappointing and probably dumbest part of the film odd pop music popping in from time to time and just felt overall throw away not the direction i wanted dc to go in its a shame release the snyder cut,fantasy
twenty minutes in and im already bored that doesnt happen too often usually i can stick it out but there are things i just didnt like about this film first of all none of the ocean dwelling people have gills to breathe under water secondly talking under water  telepathy would have been way cooler thirdly no fins super muscular fins for legs would have been more understandable then when theyre out of water they develop legs and vice versa kind of like the little mermaid forthly using ocean dwelling creatures that already exist in nature instead of some far fetched crazy creation would have grounded the story more and made it seem plausible the laser weapons just have to go again lets keep it traditional to what they actually have available from nature to usebottom line is that this version sucks ocean water and id like my money back,fantasy
this movie was nothing more than a average superhero movie with a mild story line,fantasy
this movie was a failure i waited a lot more of this because of the trailer this movie seemed to be epic but it was boring and pointless cartoon was so much better than this movie and that is sad  a 7 score is so unffair this movie should be down of a 4 it seems that the people who ranks here dont know much about cinema ,fantasy
the dialogue is very boring there is nothing entertaining about it story is too heavy and totally overloaded with political and legal issues i was just missing a straight forward storyline with some good action movies like that should be fun to watch with a positive feeling,fantasy
yes i never have seen a movie with these great graphics dc step it game up thank you with hollywood pushing out garage with marvel thinking they are the best so they got political with black panther please marvel and hollywood stop with ur hate towards trump worry about making great movies this movie past you guys,fantasy
who the hell gave all those high notes to bring the average to 72 the clishes o god how many can there be in one movie the story is like from a cereal box cover the messy scenes cut randomly the cgi scenery the generic cgi baddies the cgi costumes everything is cgi and it looked even worse then justice league the screenplay acting continuity jokes all of it is on the power rangers level i still cant shake it off,fantasy
actors were great story was perfect and music killed it too i am more a marvel fan but this movie is everything i wanted from dc,fantasy
pure trash by james wan embarassing to watch but hey the vfx were kinda good amber heard is just so bad at acting wow jason momoa can only act as himself doing another character the directing is lazy and the actors dont even care the script more like scribbles cheesy af garbage,fantasy
just an all around bad movie really cringy dialogue throughout bad cgi to the point that it just looks like they are standing in front of a green screen most of the time and just overall a really boring slow movie i think the non stop superhero movies are starting to take their toll and this is what we get skip this movie at all costs,fantasy
i couldnt get past 30 minutes of this movie cheesy oneliners bad acting and a blown opportunity visually not a bad movie but i could not suffer through it i really want dc to just blow it all up and start over,fantasy
 you have superpowers why do you need high technology you are not like batman or black panther when moves in the sea he is super fast and faster than that useless ship cmon,fantasy
movieland is saturated by superhero movies anymore i shy away from them because the formula has pretty much been exhausted i rented this one for a diversion on vacation my expectations are fairly low these days i just want an interesting story with good actors which carry the film to the degree that the special effects reinforce them not carry them i gave it three stars because it is shiny not unique shininess though but the film felt forced and rambling i took my dog out to pee and didnt miss anything important it is long and boring i did think the swirly red scene was interesting visually but that 30 seconds just seemed to fly bu if gizmos and big stuff and characters ninjaing each other work for you then this will be acceptable if you yearn for semioriginal somewhat cohesive content you may be disappointed too long too ordinary,fantasy
the fact that dc pulled this movie after justice league debacle is a dismay to many in my opinion they have always made better solo movies compared to marvel at this stage mos and bvs may be a critical failure but they were true classics which only an ardent dc lover can understand not to disrespect others opinions but the criticism received by these movies was just unfair and whats more appalling is the common complaint of movie being too dark these movies are made and meant to be dark which most of the critics berated and lost the whole plot made over a billion dollar and is the dcs highest grossing movie which shattered many other records during its leggy run the fact that movie was such a huge box office success after jl is a huge relief to the fans and the production house this success is imperative to dceu and its future installmentscoming to the movie has right amalgamation of story visuals and action sequences out of these departments vfx has been top notch that one would feel wet after coming out of the 3d imax screens it is synonymous to avatar in terms of the graphics and one of the mainstay for the films success furthermore the trench sequence under the sea is a visual spectacle and major highlight of the moviestory wise movie is well balanced and predictable at times but overall it is decent story line that sets up perfectly for the sequel which is expected to start soon the actors played their part well especially jason mamoa charisma is a huge benefactor for the films wide reach across the globe that later turned into box office numbersfinally is legitimate movie which cant be juxtaposed to any other superhero movie as there no such similar made till now although the movie wont blow your mind but gives a refreshing feeling with astonishing visuals which cant be missed in theatrescomic book wise  1010normal movie  810,fantasy
me encant mucha accin y muy buen guion imperdible,fantasy
his father a lighthouse keeper his mother an atlantean queen arthur curry aka is a halfbreed hero with astonishing powers that make him a valuable asset to surface dwellers and the rightful king of the undersea nationa role which he continually refuses to accept when his halfbrother orm unveils a scheme to declare war on the surface arthur has no choice but to reclaim his birthright if he wishes to protect those he loves latest addition to the dceu is chockfull of conventional elements like action globetrotting adventure romance and cheeky humor much of which you can see coming a mile away yet somehow still manages to be engaging thanks to effective casting a spectacular view of the aquatic world and a good decision by director wan to never take things too seriously glib brawny momoa is perfectly cast and theres also good supporting roles for heard as the obligatory love interest and dafoe as the traditionalist mentor despite the familiarity of which there is much this is more fun than youd expect ,fantasy
jason mamoa is superb he quite literally takes your breath away he also brings great humour to the role the visuals are stunning fast paced with a lot of action and highly enjoyable the only thing for me was amber heard i would have liked an actress to compliment jason i felt not a strong enough actress and she didnt look quite right she looked like an older ariel from the disney film the little mermaid,fantasy
this movie happens to be a comparison with the last movie i commented on the imagination contained in bumblebee belongs to the younger level not only naive but also vulgar the imagination of this movie is obviously it should be classified as mature and it is a highquality imagination the special effects are also appropriate,fantasy
ive watched for 3 times already and really love it this movie is straightforward the music is superb the characters and views in the movie are awesome every scene is interesting for me plus i love the family value added in the movie overall i enjoyed this movie so much this is probably my most favorite movie from dc league,fantasy
1010 for the visuals 510 for the story and 810 for the characters,fantasy
this is my favorite superhero movie of 2018 with its stunning visual effects amazing costume designs a perfect actor playing the superhero and a new interesting world that i cant wait to see more of succeeded giving me one of the best cinema experience ever kudos to james wan for making an amazing film about a superhero that has been the center of laughs for a long time but not anymore,fantasy
the visuals of the film are highlight very entertainingly presented movie throughout the run timeplot was expansive with lots of characters own storyline but lot underpowered in completing individual story line the visuals seemed cartoonish when characters were floating in wateroverall an entertaining movie with good story and performance definitely lacking the punch though,fantasy
im not sure if those writing the bad reviews are just really into comics and have some bias towards this movie i just like watching movies and really couldnt care less about comics or brands of comics or anything like that after reading some reviews i really did expect a mediocre movie and kind of delayed watching it i dont go to the theater a lot so i opted for bumblebee instead of this just because of the negative reviews forim not going to go into detail about the movie but just want to put my opinion out there that this movie is exceptional its hard to do an underwater world that doesnt look cheesy so i think the filmmakers have done the best ive seen so far with the underwater scenes the storyline is somewhat linear as all the movies based on comic books are that i have seen i was entertained the entire movie thought the battle scenes were very well done and found the characters interestingthe development of the love story between mera and is simple and predictable but its based on a comic book what do you expect i thought black mantas role in the movie was excellent and found him more interesting than king ormi dont know if the low ratings are a dc or marvel thing but i think they are unfounded,fantasy
jason momoa amber heard patrick wilson and willem dafoe star in this 2018 actionfantasy based on the dc comics momoa plays the title character born as arthur curry a halfhuman who learns of his origins of the sea he travels to the underwater kingdom of atlantis where his halfbrother king orm wilson rules and tries to stop him from destroying our world but must prove to be worthy of the throne dafoe spiderman plays vulko arthurs mentor and heard the ward plays mera a princess who helps and finds romance with arthur dolph lundgren rocky iv nicole kidman dead calm and temuera morrison the island of dr moreau are also featured this is a good comic book flick with a decent cast beautiful visuals  great score i recommend,fantasy
it was such a great movie best movie in the dceu possibly the dc,fantasy
the story line of movie not very charming  you can know what while be happen  but in the other side the character of aguaman with very good and of course the optical effects was the best of in it,fantasy
ignore the desensitized crybaby bores that have no imagination beautiful visuals entertaining,fantasy
most critics praise the cgi and criticize the plot the cgi was well done but you could not see it well because the cut was too fast especially in the fight scenes you could hardly recognize anything from the wellmade 3d work if i were a 3d artist who worked on the film i would be disappointed with the result thats a problem with many fantasy movies the fast fight scenes are just annoying,fantasy
great visuals costumes set pieces and sfx primarilygood momoa  the final actaverage ocean master  black manta sound editing and kidmanbad patrick wilsonawful plot convoluted and illogical almost all dialogue simple stereotypical and contrivedi personally have not seen a film with such a massive gap in quality between the visuals and writing easily the worst dialogue of 2018 but also a contender for best artistic vision worth watching but only barelyvisually excellent wans direction clearly focuses on momoa outshining the other characters which he certaintly does and individual artists being given liberty to amaze the audience with stunning details with set pieces spanning multiple genres and a rather broad scope on atlantean culture dc almost makes this film above average but fails in almost every other category aside from these few specific areaspart of what makes dc comics and animated features so great is their willingness to not oversimplify complex themes ocean master is a phenomenal and complex character but the writers in this film made him a onedimensional stereotype this pattern is repeated across nearly every character as each speaks exactly what is expected and nothing more momoa is the slight exception to this as he brings humanity lol pun to the derivative atlantean dialogue this decision was clearly taken out of fear that creating multiple complex logical characters would overcomplicate the plot and ruin the experience for the lowest common denominator whether or not this is a positive is up for debate but with such depth in source material i personally believe we should hold dc films to higher standardsis it awful no but it does have very poor execution in a few areas which are highlighted by excellence in other areas it is my sincere hope that future dceu releases focus on character depth primarily and visual artistry secondarily without a change soon the opportunity to rival marvel may be gone and the complex characters we love will be confined to the small screen permanently,fantasy
for a long time dc has produced movies that are quite enjoyable deliver stable intake of action but dont dwell too hard on the scenario kind of a quick bite to fight the hunger before the feast that is cooking behind the kitchen door after giving the trailer a look i thought was going to be a bit different and has a potential to stir that stiff dark matter that we call a universefairly enough we can call it an origin story but the character has been on our radar before which means that the basic knowledge is there and we dont need a fundamental course i really like arthur simply because he is downtoearth guy not nerdy as barry allen not pompous as bruce wayne not inconspicuous as clark kent kind of like diana prince but male and for sure not metal as victor stonewill not hide anything from you by saying that in the end the plot as usual goes down the drain and as always we can observe some particles of good ideas getting stuck on the exit 2h23m was the amount of actual time although if we take out all the slow motion and sugaring of viewers eyes with abnormal amount of visuals we are left with a common 1h30m or even lessthe most confusing and disgusting point of the movie was the buildup of the villain that has never been finished which can only mean the path for a sequel and on this the curse of abruptly cut stories continues a lot of actions that should have borne major consequences were just forgotten and walked on by like a beggar on the streetyou know what they say each hollywood project has two wolves  visuals and story the one that you feed most eats another  here we have the first one already gnawing the latter but the poor thing has a few breaths left going back to the conclusions i would say that jason momoa has been training all his life and is worthy wielding the trident however as the rule says  if its not planned as a oneman movie then it cannot be carried like that i hope dc will understand it and put a little bit more effort next time,fantasy
im not going to preface the review with the usual i am a superhero fan blah blahlets get to itsummarycinematography and graphics  810sound design  810story  410acting  characters huh10 needs explaining belowenjoyment level  dumb funbreakdowncinematographythe trailer made it pretty clear that we could expect good shots environments scenes and the movie delivered on this front there were a few shots that seemed a bit too brightcartoonish to me hence 1 point the other 1 goes to the cgi yes it was generally good but there were inconsistencies especially in the fight scenes some scenes could have been shortersound designno surprise here in fact few films today manage to bother me when it comes to effects and music choices there a few sudden seemingly unwarranted tone changes hence but overall it was finestoryit has every possible clich you can think of its a really uninspired boring borderline senseless story guy is normal guy is destined to be some king guy does not care guy sees bad things about to happen guy suddenly cares guy gets beaten by villain guy goes to search cheat weapon guy finds cheat weapon that is guarded and will only be given to the worthy guy is worthy ofc guy gets back with god mode guy kicks the crap out of villain guy gets girl yaaaythe only plot twist that i didnt see coming or was too uninterested to notice at that point was queen atlanna being alive after she was sacrificed to the trenchtheres also pacing issues and tone changes that dont establish what kind of movie this is comedy drama adventureacting  charactersheres the tricky part i read a review in which someone complained that this movie had too much cgi and that movies arent made the same ways old ones used to my immediate reaction to that was well what were you expecting of a movie that takes place underwater did you think theyd give the actors scuba suits and throw them into the mariana trenchthe water effects were added in post and most of the time the actors were attached to some rigsdue to thismost scenes that had water in them seemed a bit off to me it wasnt bad or anything but there was something off in the movement and expressionsbut the land scenes have no excuse and some characters have shown the emotional range of a brickyou heard me rightwith all that being said its hard to score the acting in this oneso ill just say that momoa carries the movie and give it a 510side note what the hell happened to black manta i mean we had him introduced as one of the first characters got his motive for revenge the death of his father saw him help trigger the war negotiating for techand thenhe just got thrown off a cliff and then weve never heard or seen him again i know he was one dimensional but after the cliff fallprefferably as an end credits scene a little scene at the end showing a hand come out of the water wouldve been enough to set him up as the villain for another movieenjoyement levelin conclusion this movie was nothing more than dumb fun there were no real stakes there was no emotional investment for the characters but it was pretty ok to watch as a popcorn movie and i think thats because we have another case of the actor fits the role,fantasy
the first time i watched this movie it was on a night when my husband was super tired so he fell asleep after 30 min usually ill turn off the movie and watch my own tv shows and wait to finish the movie on another night but i was so sucked in and mesmerized by the acting storyline and the special effects that i kept on watching till the end and couldnt wait for a sequel will there be a sequel please tell me sookay all my dramatic review aside i guess im kinda a nerdy woman and a lot of it reminded me of the game wow hahaha which is probably why i really liked the movie i love fantasy movies like these and i watched it again because hubby wanted to finish it and i was still mesmerized the actors and actresses acting were top notch and sigh i just loved this movie i wish i can ride a seahorse,fantasy
there is so much to love in this film it leaves you wanting more at least i want more,fantasy
dc has finally hit the big time with this marvelesque rendition of definitely worth watching a couple of times,fantasy
i was expecting focus of this money would be like lets save sea life just like robot 20 movie focused on birdstoo much hype very slow and gets boring sometimesits a typical masala hollywood movie,fantasy
one of the best movie loved the action underwater scenes its a completely amazing experience watching this movie,fantasy
i completely avoided this movie thinking another stupid superhero movie with a fish guy then saw a still of the visual effects of atlantis created by ilm and thought might check it out just for the effectsboy was i in for a rideutterly mind blowing in every way sure the story is cliched and old as stories good vs evil love vs hate but the fairly unique setting and the amazing cast and execution coupled with the most amazing effects work and fight scenes i have seen in a long time make this ride well worth taking its almost like the first time you watch the original star wars with sequences that made me think of george lucas in his prime the director and the filmmakers have done an amazing jobplus its got a great ending not openended like the marvel crap its a solid happy ending like the first star warsjust watch it,fantasy
for plagiarism at best and crimes against humanity at worst,fantasy
growing up with the superhero comics of the 50s and 60s was one of my favorites i was super excited to see what they would do with his character and it was a double pleasure knowing that jason mamoa would play my hero i wasnt disappointed at all with the exciting action especially being thrilled with so much of it underwater loved the brief love story in the beginning loved the costuming and special effects too one important note if you are one of those who stops watching the moment the credits roll dont do it youll miss out on something very important part way into the credits ill give this an extra 12 star for the humor in this film which many superhero films lack,fantasy
the special effects and practical effects in this movie were so bad it kept taking me out of the movie the cgi is the worst ive seen in any movie with a budget over 5k,fantasy
is definitely a hit for me wonder woman in my humble opinion saved dceu liveaction flicks from disparity made them great again good origin story good action excellent visual and a definite crowdpleasing moment at the end i recommend watching this flick with a bunch of friends and have a good time,fantasy
such a highly rated movie is justawful it tries to cover up bad writing with an over abundance of cgi the soundtrack is forced its hard to believe that a sequel is already planned for this,fantasy
the best dceu movie ever cant wait for the sequel in december 2022,fantasy
wooden acting wooden dialogue wooden storyline wooden baddies and way too long for a 3 dvd rental i was robbed i would say this was a paint it by numbers film but half the numbers were sadly drawn in crayon very poor 410,fantasy
jeez what a chore just finding this option anyway jason mamoa is a hottieno doubt about that hes the reason we watched this right poor script poor direction great cgi not much else two good scenes nicole eating a goldfish and the acquarium scene make this move viewable for 2 minutes,fantasy
so jason momoa wears a wallet chain in 90 of this movie and its offputting,fantasy
perfect science fiction movies everything went well in this movie couldnt even get a chance to get the the toilet brilliant,fantasy
dc goes for quality not quantity this is the best superhero movie i have seen since the dark knight trilogy keep it up long live,fantasy
this movie overall good and enjoy to watch fight and battle scene is really fun but some poin is missing for overall storyline is really decent movies try to play save but for real a lot scene just reflect this movie like a 10 movie its like kids dreaming start with a reason decent conflict and solve problem and sometimes is really easy to know whats happen next in this story but is pg 13 with no charming for audience to watch i mean a whole movie its just like reveange with no good message is really not goodand also why cgi on dessert scene is really bad i mean you can really see it isnt real just green screen is really terribleyeah but overall good but decent,fantasy
spoilers the editing and sequencing and sometimes the dialog need help director wan forgets any introductions and goes for nonsequential development what follows is a mess for the first 30 min or so the story gets some traction about the time atlantis is wonderfully introduced the visuals help us forget the shortfalls and problems with dialog direction and acting music soundtrack as popsynths work well but some of the contemporary soundtracks fallflat jason momoas hangloose mentality seems at first outofplace and too loose but we acclimate to it amber heard is passable and probably couldve been done better by someone else the movie is certainly like a liveaction cartoon and though sinks initially holds on to its grandiose bravado enough to become entertaining with the help of an underwater mishmash of medieval and scifi that works  710  better than expected,fantasy
a lot of action good story likable characters long movie but worth the 2hr  runtime,fantasy
i had no expectations at all but i got surprisedbeautiful cgi and colors the story is okay after seeing this movie you know a little bit more about his origins a good superheromovie one of dcs bestrecommend this onea swede,fantasy
first let me say i was hopeful but not expecting muchdc hasnt had a lot of luck here lately i must admit however that i was greatly and pleasantly surprised told an excellent story the pace was perfect and flowed well it was action packed and yet it had a nice mix of humor and family values my favorite part of the movie was the reaction of the underwater life at the aquarium when arthur was threatened it was heartwarming and showed the great power that he was capable of my biggest disappointment was that we didnt get a chance to see enough of the black manta other than that this was definitely the best dc movie to date calm down wonder woman fans just my opinion hope you enjoy the movie,fantasy
the ending scene priceless i like the fact that this movie is more than just fighting and explosions it also has themes like love friendship and family women are strong and independent they choose who they love even though tradition dictates otherwise and the depictions of history are so well thought this movie has everything,fantasy
the visual effects were so breathtaking fight scenes were epic jason momoa was so natural with his character that it made the movie better just him being himself each actor brought life to the characters amazing movie and i am so happy in my opinion it was better than bvs,fantasy
everything that might have dragged the movie down became irrelevant because of one thing sharks with freakin lasers attached to their heads,fantasy
visually stunning with a great storyline and great actors add up to a fun actionpacked entertainment,fantasy
best dc movie daughter loves this movie watched it 50 times,fantasy
this movie was brilliant dc finally made a good movie jason momoa is exellent actor movie effects plot i mean almost everything was awesome,fantasy
i couldnt help but love this movie i also didnt take it seriously it seemed to be purposeful in its cheesy outrageousness by just enjoying it i was able to overlook things like why was traveling in a boat when he can clearly move faster in the water and in a storm overall i think its worth the watch,fantasy
arthur curry aka jason momoa is told that he is the only one who can bring the two worlds of land and sea together and he must do it as king arthur says he is no king and has no desire to be so princess mera amber heard tells him he must do this because his half brother king orm patrick wilson says its time for the sea to claim the land and scorch the whole earth the only way can do all this is with the trident that the first king of atlantis used and is most powerful believes the trident is fiction in time agrees to this mission but first he must beat david kane yahya abdulmateen ii who wants revenge on because he killed his father jesse kane michael beach in the submarine when they as pirates tried to overtake the subthe story opens with arthurs father thomas curry temeura morrison who finds an unconscious atlanna nicole kidman who is the queen of atlantis and they fall in love and they have arthur in time she leaves him to protect arthur and she must return to atlantis to save him she vows to return to thomasthe rest of the movie has and mera going here and there worldwide looking for clues to where the trident is he does have a battle with his half brother king orm but mera helps him escapethe cgi is absolutely unbelievable and youd swear you are seeing things for real yes some of the cgi scenes do go on for a little too long but they are mesmerizing and really really good and director james wan must be given tons of kudos for this absolutely great production he may get an oscar for his work the acting all around is spot on the cinematography is excellentnotables willam dafoe as vulko a counselor to the king of atlantis and he claims to know where the trident is dolph lundgren as king nereus who king orm wants an alliance with amber heard as princess mera is also the daughter of king nereus kaan guldur as 9yr old arthur and the big shark in the aquarium sees mike jack andrew bully arthur and bangs against the glass enclosure until arthur puts his hands up to tell the shark to stop otis dhanji as 13yr old arthur being taught warrior techniques by vulko julie andrews as karathan the voice of a giant monster that guards the trident and tells arthur that only the real king can extract the tridenti did not recognize nicole kidman when she first appeared as queen atlanna as she has this amazing ability to transform herself into a more beautiful woman kudos the music is excellent watch carefully and you will see an octopus on the many drums hawhen the credits run the first time stay and you will see that david kane from the sub remember is still alive and wants to know who is and this will lead us into sequels ready i am 1010violence yes sex no nudity no humor yes at times language two swordsrating a,fantasy
like any marvel movies it was enjoyable wasnt boring at all has a lot of fighting scenes and stuff blowing up the actors did a great job and it was cool how they made things look underwater not my favorite marvel film but it was good,fantasy
donr get mw wrong this movie was pretty good definetly more humor than i was expecting but the special effects were pretty awesome the movie has its moments but sort of bland its a mix between avatar thor atlantis the disney movie and like jack sparrow vibe but its was pretty good movie,fantasy
honestly the storythe plot all very well done really enjoyed the movie overall very well done the effects were definitely hard to come by but who could do so much underwater the only thing i would have changed is how red her hair was a little too ariel guysif you like your comic hero coming to life and escaping reality you will enjoy this movie,fantasy
incredible special effects and action throughout i dont buy many movies but this one is a keeper i could watch it over and over like i do avatar,fantasy
given the many other dc movies outside of wonder woman this was probably the best one that however is not saying much as several others were horrendous the movie was more cgi then actual acting meaning it a little cartoonish the plot was outrageously predictable but most in the dc universe are,fantasy
8 stars is being kind it wasnt offensive but it sure could have been better not much of a story its more on action and animation i think the hype started building since the hbo series entourage now im hoping for ii with a much better storyline,fantasy
ive been big fan of ever since i started reading about his adventures in dc comics hah adventure comics when i was a very young kid i grew up on an island where the ocean was the centre of my universe its all i knew so reading stories about heroes fighting crime in these large concrete jungles in parts of the world id never visited was completely alien to me youre basically telling me tales of people living on the moon and i couldnt relate to that but heroes that fought crime in the ocean that was literally my backyard and something that my young mind could wrap its head aroundthe other part of the story that resonated with me was arthurs biracial and bicultural background he had a foot in both worlds but was treated like an outsider by each one that was also a feature of my childhood growing up as a minority on an island without much of a tie to the culture of the majorityso was my guythe thing that impressed me the most about the film was the ambitiousness of the filmmakers they didnt hold back at all when making this movie given the underperformance and tepid reception of the dcu films to date with the exception of wonder woman its reasonable to expect that the studio would have scaled back the production budget and made a smaller film to reduce their risk and ensure that it turned a profit but they didnt they fully committed to the project and it shows this is a very expensive looking moviethe other thing that impressed me was how closely the film sticks to the source material based upon the rebooted dc comics new 52 series from the creative team of geoff johns ivan reis and paul pelletier they changed very little from the book inculcating jasons hawaiian heritage into the role of arthur curry and changing the sequence of events around atlannas time spent on the surface world with tom curry which is cleaner and works better than the comic book are the only deviations the rest is exactly like the source materialin this day and age where theyre trying to generate broad appeal amongst an audience that has a casual relationship with the character and his world thats no small featthe filmmakers also give us the viewing audience an extensive look at universe taking us from his birthplace in amnesty bay to atlantis and then on to all or most of the remaining undersea kingdoms all while introducing us to the main characters from those places this could have easily caused the film to feel overstuffed but it doesnt it really felt like world building which is something that marvel has done very well with the mcu and that allows them to tell stories beyond the typical origin stories going forward i think this is really important for the ongoing viability of the character because not a lot of people are familiar with him and his universeall that said it is a bit of a silly movie but in a good way at no point during the film did i find it hard to suspend my disbelief it wasnt trying to be anything other than what it is a big bombastic summer blockbuster tentpole movie youre not going to find shakespeare here but you will find a superhero fantasy film with a little greek mythology lord of the rings indiana jones star wars and a smattering of horror elements it blends together seamlessly and creates something unique amongst the superhero genre not to mention unique amongst the typical origin story weve seen many timesthe bottom line is that this movie is fun and engaging visually stunning with great action sequences supported by a compelling enough story without leaning too heavily on comic book tropes all while staying very faithful to the source materialthis is for me the best dcu movie to date and im eagerly looking forward to the next installment with james wan at the helm,fantasy
for those who dont understand why its cooleverything works fun easy good looking perfect 3d music is beautiful what else do you want gone with the windlast five minutes are so so maybe they didnt know how to finished it all or it was justice slopy cut at the end but anyhow  its one of the best hero3d movies so far,fantasy
i just hate her so god damn much i will never like her ever,fantasy
as a action you want the brainless scenes where a lot of stuff is going on but you keep up in this you need a migraine pill its 223 hours maximum action with a freaking dialogue dont get me wrong i kind of liked it but now and then i realized i had no clue whats going on in the story and how they actually ended up in another fight in another kingdom under water or on land,fantasy
no social issues central to the plot no political agendas no identity politics no special interest groups catered tojust entertainmentthere may still be hope left for entertainment coming out of hollywood,fantasy
i was looking forward to this movie however it was a great let downvery few actors were actually any good and honestly if mamoa wasnt in this movie it would have been a massive flop amber heards acting is pure rubbish ive seen kids act better than her and the cliche loveinducing moments make your eyes roll,fantasy
it started with a good rhythm and an interesting story but there is so much change of scenery has so many different tones and rhythms sometimes it looks like the treasure hunt others a romcom then jurassic park and a little horror like pitch black like what how i do not like this combination of so many tones it gives me a feeling of confusion proving that i can not adapt to the storyline to enjoy it i think it has the most spectacular and beautiful scenes but they are only because they are aesthetically pleasing it does not fulfill any function for methis movie completely disorients me half of the time i did not know what was happening i find ridiculous both the humor and the combenience of the story the same resource is used to interrupt scenes is so abused that you expect it i have the tones so separate in my head that i feel like ive watched different movies with the same characters,fantasy
youve seen one youve seen them all while i do agree that jason momoa makes a good there is not enough in this film to justify its hype on the surface is everything you want from a popcorn movie big fights that makes you yawn sexy topless superhero sibling rivalry silly villains with crappy plans awkward moment of comedybut there are other popcorn movies that make you care for their characters and dont bore you to tears with nonsense fighting scenesi wanted it to be epic i truly did but there is nothing original about this movie its okay for one viewing but if there will be an 2 i really do hope they will up the stakes i didnt feel any tension in this movieand am i the only one that thinks that the villain costumes were ridiculous,fantasy
the visual effects of this movie shocked megenerally speaking a movie with a visual special effects theme can always make me look forward to it such as frozen how to train your dragon the ice and sky from the beginning to the end how to do it in the same material but with a colorful changeit is a test of the skill of the production teamone of the scenes that i felt particularly stunning was that the male and female protagonists encountered many monsters in the trench kingdom when they jumped out of the sea and broke through the monsters the feeling from a crosssectional perspective was really wonderful the people who are intensively phobia will surely feel uncomfortable and pleasant anyway this scene is the main reason why i admire the visual effect of this moviein addition the female characters in this movie are very cute whether it is the mother of the main actor or the main actress afterwards their interaction with the human world is really innocent and cute you can see that they really cant hate humans which is why there may be a way to make the land and the sea people live in peace,fantasy
if i was a 10 year old kid again this film would have been awesome how do dc keep on getting it so wrong now im a jason momoa fan ill watch anything with him in because hes a reliable action star but this dragged was cheesy as hell and was definitely not one for men aged 20come on dc the dark knight trilogy got it right just follow that formula stop repeating the same mistakesthis film is average to say the least even the thor movies are better than this and thats saying something damn,fantasy
interviewer our next film i would like to ask you about isjohnnyphreak dude holy wow i mean no disrespect when i say this but is the most fun movie to come out of dcwbinterviewer can you elaborate on thatjohnnyphreak wonder woman is fantastic i love that film gal gadot is dianawonder woman to a t the film has a decent story great emotional beats and some fun action sequences there are comedic elements and it so cool to watch it does so much for actress femaleled superhero movies and i dont want to compare them at all is a bananas fun fantasy ride that us dc comics fans have been waiting forinterviewer so you take dc over marveljohnnyphreak if you were to put me on the spot i would easily take dc over marvel only because dc has my favorite comic book character of all time superman let me explain im not a huge of the character hes not one of my favorites but when we finally got to see him serious in the comics and animated films it did the character justice no pun intended jason momoas take is a bit different but equally as cool and confident hes not just a man who can talk to fish hes a bridge between worlds hes this powerful being whos also a total badass hes having so much fun being this character is drips offscreen i cant wait to see more of him and i hope we get to see more of him interacting with other dc superheroes one day ill explain my love of the justice league movieinterviewer can you give us some of the plot details for those who havent been following the storyjohnnyphreak its actually pretty simple arthur curry is half human half atlantian his mother fell in love with a human and they had him his half brother orm hates him and the land dwellers they declare war on the land from the sea in order to save his world and all of the world has to team up soon to be queen mira amber heard to prove to atlantis that he is the one true king one the way he makes enemies of a train pirate who goes by black manta the film jumps all over the world in a fun fantasy adventure with elements of indiana jones the fifth element and even some old school monster moviesinterviewer much as been said about the cast how are they in this filmjohnnyphreak as i said earlier momoa is excellent as the and easily carries the film whenever hes on screen amber heard is very good as mira shes not the helpless damsel in distress shes a soon to be a queen that cares about her people her land and is just as capable of kickass as the filmmakers did her well patrick wilson as orm is okay you get his ideology he likes to chew scenery and is very over the top in his portrayal but it fits the film hes in willem dafoe is the excellent mentor role bring his talents to the character the scene stealer of the film is yahya abdulmateen ii as manta he effectively in what screen time he has to give dc film fans the best villain theyve had in all of the dc live action films his character has weight style and a personal attachmentgrudge with it gives him more depth than most superhero villains get to have i cant wait to see more of himinterviewer this is a big action film how are the action sequences and directionjohnnyphreak im not saying this as hyperbole james wan is the best action director working today he has a few other directors on his heels but i would place him at the time the action scenes in this film are wild they are so well shot so much fun and pretty crazy he doesnt put himself in a box he goes for broke and they all shine when happening theres an opening sequence with nicole kidmans atlanna who she is great in this that looks to be filmed in one take its jawdropping the film uses neon colors and sets to express this is a fantasy world and it pops this is a trippy watch but so enjoyable wan even gets to go back to his roots with one sequence that is very horror inspired its probably my favorite scene in the movie its violent kind of terrifying and feeds into my need for wan to make a monster movieinterviewer any final thoughts aboutjohnnyphreak james wan has created a wonderfully rich and deep universe here with his first superhero entry the whole cast is great with momoa heard and abdulmateen ii being the standouts the film looks beautiful including a bunch of sequences shot in imax the action is wild easy to watch and just fun the story is not that deep but it spans all over the world it has the best elements of indiana jones with none of the crystal skull all fans of dc should have seen this on the big screen because its worth the price of admission but if they couldnt see it in 4k because the transfer is gorgeous was one of my favorite films of 2018 and is now tied for my second favorite dc comic live action film,fantasy
great movie of dceugreat movie of ocean worldgreat movie with different creaturesgreat movie with best charactersgreat movie with best casting,fantasy
 is a stunning miracle the most visually oddball and mesmerizing bigbudget superhero film the world has ever seen do not misunderstand me the arthur curry solo film is far from perfect it presents an origin borntobeking story rhythmically goes from dynamite to languor and storytellingwise is whimsical and silly dealing with greek mythology but that bravery and audacity coming from a huge budget and an amazing source material are what makes it an experience as dangerously unconventional as imperfectly extraordinaryits no secret that the dc extended universe went from bad to worse within american comic book film landscape diabolically histrionic unnecessarily drawnout fiercely dark overly serious whatever the dilemma may be walter hamada the new president of dcbased film production

billiondollar ip from which spinoffs prequels and sequels emanate these endless victories are the reason why the malay is now warners spoiled child which was more than enough to entrust him one of the riskiest most crucial projects for the future of dchis kinetic and idiosyncratic style for action is high and low from stem to stern fight sequences are provocative diligent straight out of the wildest video game the filmmaker also finds time to experiment and toy with settings nearly masterful camera movements and angles with explosive 90180degree rotations he previously tested in the hobbs vs shaw handtohand combat in furious 7 and then f gary gray in the prison escape in the fate of the furious the camera savagely runs at the audience endowing dynamism and thrill in large part by the uberexcellent technical artful features of a couple of incredibly and masterfully executed sequences that might be easily part of the annals of this postmodern genredespite cgoverstuffed even in scenes perfectly filmable in real locations the film does not limit its creative faculties we all agree that cgi is everywhere and at all times which might constantly divert attention from the flicks narrative purpose its aesthetics and visual fearlessness however make pictures an alluring spectacle propelled by truly great vfx so far far away from the gigantic oldfashioned setpieces of modern hollywood masterpieces as mad max fury road and mission impossible  fallout and yet the films an artificial delight by taking place mostly underwater it was to be expected that even with the enthusiasm and commitment of the crew it needed to be conceived or at least rendered digitally wan and his team created an entirely unique aquatic world for us certainly embellished by don burgess which is overthetop dazzling and exciting absorbent and carefully designed is pure visual ecstasy crowded with creatures altered animals atlantic beasts and why not an octopus playing the drums there is time for natural majestic landscapes as well such as a beautiful italian village the stunning sahara desert or the claustrophobic trench portraying the fantasytinged greek mythology from the comics sounds heavy but it pulls it off fabulously with inventiveness and audacity unusual in bigbudget cinema in the end its appreciated that this extremely gorgeous world harmonized by the highsounding technocompositions of an unbeatable rupert gregsonwilliams is not only a reflection of the cinema of our time but a reminder of the magnificence sound and image can achievekidman nails it as atlanna a kind of character not entirely foreign to her if you take a look at the prolific career of the eyes wide shut actress after the tenminute prologue and a surprise appearance amid the story she does have no time on screen still and all her interpretative balance between fishoutofwater humor and family drama puts her in a strange yet brilliant position a golden gift for the genre played by amber heard meras design is literally and figuratively sparkling shes the one who leads a couple of commendable sequences that breathe metoo willem dafoe as vulko embraces ambiguity having fun in a simple smaller role that doesnt seem to agree with his previous efforts especially keeping in mind that after the eccentric characters he delivered to the genre the actor has focused on more serious raw roles in outstanding dramas by sean baker and julian schnabel patrick wilson and yahya abdulmateen ii king orm and manta respectively wrongly take turns for being the bad guy its hard to tell who and where is the real villain here whether in the ambition of the former or the angerdriven vengeance of the latter they both try their best but the material does not help them at all by horror mastermind james wan is a cinematic oddity it has an irregular pace speaks louder than it should ergo runs longer than it should but even so arthur currys first solo adventure is the most playful hilarious rewarding and profitable comic book adaptation you will find in the troubled dc cinematic universe to date even if my voice is shaking i dare say it is the most eyecatching wildly stunning scifi show i have seen into a bigimpact hollywood production since james camerons avatar visually speaking to make your life easier could be synthesized like this black panther and star wars meet avatar and jupiter ascending and these in turn bump into thor ragnarok energized by a kinetic video game vibe and an unhealthy dose of toxic masculinity and sheer spectacle,fantasy

what do you want you hypocrite this is a superhero fantasy movie  people who criticise think you are better but you are worst because you dont even have a sense or mind to see thinks and the hardworking of cast and crewyou dont even be here ,fantasy
the act was amazing effects were breathtaking i was enjoying every second of the movie in the theatre along with the audience lighthearted humorous and behind all this is the problem how we as a society endanger our nature there were also bits and pieces of history nothing more can i say than amazing,fantasy

 review matters i wanted to like and enjoy this film but i agree with others here saying the plot was an overall mess of changing characterization fiascos and cliches but feel they set the bar too high those people are discussing films as if they are art and not product that discussion has gone on for years with career professional critics audience and fans it will never end because every opinion is backed by their own point of view and that will not be compromised but i agree that had a interesting fun and very strong first act that was a pleasure to see in any superhero films it is a prerequisite for good film making but then the rest of the film was disappointment it became a thor vs loki in underwater kingdom rip off and the extraneous  obvious audience viewing shiny objects plot devices thrown in with red haired forgettable underwater princess dinosaurs trident seeking sea monsters and confusing multi sea kingdoms politics junk pile rehash ruined this film disney spielberg pirates of caribbean lotr  game of thrones should sue it is very hard to know how much millions of dollars and time are spent on these to show rehash to the audience,fantasy
i am just a movie fan  such a nice fantastic movie and full of fun  especially bar scene  thx for the producers director and the lovely cast,fantasy
all these comes to point out that no matter how much money you put in a film and how much interesting character you can use from a beloved universe if you dont set the story straight you will kill its potentialdc had already messed up its film and wonder woman being just average was seen with lot of hope and without a doubt compared to previous dc films it may be a better film but we dont lower our standardsat start though nicole kidman acted well and the other guy tried his best the connection was just not there their reunion was like blah nobody caresjoke attempts were pathetic you could pinpoint the joke long before the joke is delivered they even added some joke sounds or something just pitifuland the music totally out of place just didnt feel right at all soundtracks accompanying many a things were just bad pulled you out of the experiencevillian generic the sub villian whose dad died just total waste could have scrapped him and developed the story wellthe chemistry between the leads jason mamoa and amber heard  non existent totally forced out of placeyou cant blame the actors because the dialogue and script was crap they can do nothing with the crap dialogueyou could just predict yes this is the joke part yes this is the caring part romance part and all feels so stupid and manipulatedmost unintentional hilarious scene  goes to some place in italy here the aspect ratio changes to bring in the romance or whatever she looks around in wonder and some guy gives her a bunch of roses for no reason maybe he got enticed by the red hair and just blatantly obvious distracting dress  makes some water dolphins and the kid watching it gives her a pinocchio book whateverything feels plastic no amount of light and cgi effects can mask the blandness of the whole movie trying to suck out emotions from audience unsuccessfullyjust different styles mixed here and there at times felt cinematic other times like a badly made romcom tv other times like a video gametheres a scene when its nighttime and they are in the boat towards the place with the trident and some creature things jump the ship to attack them that whole 12 minutes feels like that out of a video game the camera movement closeups the whole thingultimately the plot as a whole was not the best but it could have been salvagableforgettable watchbut its not without its positives had some pretty cool action scenesatlantis was very colourful and thats it,fantasy
i was expecting it to be mediocre but man its way better than my expectations if anyone hate this is purely a blind hater of dc not sure why critics always remains biased towards marvel i have watched it on bluray after watching captain marvel in theatre and was way better than captain marvel dont know why critics have hard feelings towardsmetacritics score clearly shows they are marvel biasrotten tomato captain marvel controversy also shows that critics are slowly being marvel bias,fantasy
it looks like a spykids movie with adultsseriously i was checking my time again and again for if to finishit has a good potential as a character but in this movie sucks sucks underwater,fantasy
wife being stolen advisor being stolen even mother supports brother the film should be called what a miserable brother old plot and btw u sure the weapons are not stolen from zelda breath of the wild plus the money kings style of using trident is really funny,fantasy
 was entertaining from beginning to the end visuals are beautiful a lot of epic moments here and there people this days are ruining movies by trying to act too smart at the end of the day a movie is supposed to be entertaining when did it stop being about entertainment and all about how the dialogue should be or how the characters should evolve or to much cgi if comics were what people think the movies should be each comic would be super long like a bible,fantasy
u couldnt decide which ones worse this or jupiter ascending i dont even know what im giving it 2 stars for,fantasy
was this a parody or something it felt like watching a power rangers ripoffi wish i had more to say but there really isnt,fantasy
jason momoa was impressive the storyline was straight out childish i love superman and wonder woman yet it stretched the bounds of credulity that this massive technological civilization could exist unknown to the rest of humanity it was more animated than live action not even a patch on wonder woman i was very disappointed,fantasy
2 horas que podra haber pasado mirando a la pared,fantasy
decent action and is very nice to look at but otherwise the cgi was way over over the top and a lot of the scenes are just cheesy like the octopus playing the drums really and some of the outfits the characters wore just looked dumb saw it but wouldnt recommend it to anyone else because it just wasnt worth the time,fantasy
take your brain out before you watch this movie and replace later poor cgi stupid story unbelievable everything in this film my partner and son enjoyed it lol i would never watch this again ever,fantasy
this is a great movie no doubt fight scenes were better the visuals was excellent the scripting was more casual and not dark like how the dc normally is which is ok but a bit too cheesy in some cases  like with the black mantabut what im really upset about is the plot turnout that ending was too corny for me it seemed more like a waltdisneyfantasy happy ending for me than a superhero onei am a huge dc fan well specifically the justice league coz you know of how they are superior both in strengths and powers compared to the avengers but honestly dceu still needs alot of work,fantasy
certainly a movie with action emotion and passion i had a blast watching this beautiful movie,fantasy
this movie is just a copy over of tron legacys effects and music too no originality at all in fact everything you see in this movie is a copy version from somewhere in some other movies its just damn obvious the underwater world is a replicate from tron legacy i hate copy cats stealing others work and make it to your own shame on u those involve in the makings of,fantasy
95 of this movie is done using cgi but it is beautiful smooth and almost flawless compared to the absolute terrible and ugly cgi in black panther i am not much of a superhero movie fan but i am happy i watched this movie i definitely recommend it,fantasy
beautiful looking film with great actors telling the story of a dc comics hero that has never been a list jason mamoa did a decent job capturing this new take on the classic stodgy king of the seas the humor was a nicely scattered side note and the depiction of the various kingdoms was great visually stunning colors and creatures with a fast furious action tempo looking forward to more,fantasy
amazing movieits really goodi am really injoy,fantasy
this is an enjoyable movie visual is the best i ever seen,fantasy
i rate this movie using two scales critically and experience critically this movie only gets a 25 but in terms of enjoyment and experience freakin 55 i know that the 55 is subjective because it applies only to myself and nobody else however this is what i think of the movie if youre looking for a wellwritten and greatly structured movie then i wouldnt recommend this to you but if you want to watch an entertaining and fun movie that can keep you engaged for 2  12 hours then you may enjoy this movie i say that its the 3rd best dceu film but most of the movies that exist besides wonder woman arent good to begin withnow the story was generic the pacing was off the dialogue was more cheesy then it needed to be the characters dont have much personality but rather exposition people however i really likeed jason mamoa as his charm kept the movie entertaining amber heard actually did better than i expected but just not anything special riddled with plotholes and inconsistencies however thank goodness that it had the best dceu villain so far ocean master so overall critically only a 25now in terms of enjoyment a 55 the visuals arent perfect but they did a pretty good job with a movie that takes place underwater most of the time the action was good not for the underwater battles the action scene of them in sicily will hold up for a long time the colours and effects were very engagingultimately this movie was mainly about spectacle and excitement so it really depends on what youre looking with this movie critically it did not do good which i hate but i had a tremendously good time with it definitely not a 110 or 1010,fantasy
i was tourmented for 25 hours my wife fell asleep and i really want my time and money back this goes down as the worst film i have seen in a very long time and i see a lot a films story written by a 5 year old and effects that makes you want to call holliwood and ask them to give us a break is there a competition on who can overdo it the most going on why has this film received such a high scori will wonder till i die ,fantasy
we also have to see the message the message of this movie is all of us are one we are different but one so we can live together in one world  together we make it savethe visual actions characters  message of the movie can make it 1010 but movie is little bit boring i mean this movie need more funny things or anti mainstream jokes it make it 910 in my opinion,fantasy
how bad is this its really bad and i cant for the life of me figure out how it has such a high rating i really dont know where to start people riding on sea horses people riding on sharks a special forces solider who looks like he has a giant ant head underwater soldiers that bleed water any every possible psychedelic colour who could imagineits was like the director was on a bad acid trip myself and the family who are by the way big fans of the marvel franchise could only watch this for about 40 minutes its a shame because jason momoa who i think is a very decend actor was let down by this very poor script this character was much better portrayed in justice league but then zack snyder directed that where was directed by james wan who would be better known for directing horror movies and i think this is where he went off the rails 2 has been announced and i fear when james wan gets his hands on it it will be more of the same one to avoid,fantasy
movie had great graphics and lots of action writing and plot were subterranean but the worst part was no stan leee cameo,fantasy
this is really really really cheesy the script story are really bad since the dark kight only wonder women has been entertaining in the dc universe dc needs to start over from the beginning and act like these movies never happen,fantasy
nonsensical story with to many ripoffs nothing original id rather watch my fish tank how the actors can take themselves seriously after thisshame on all of you,fantasy
i dont know if i really love it or not but i like it and i think it is a huge improvement from dc after failure after another  it has a lot to offer from the decent cinematography to the great action most of the time and the colors  yes finally dc discovered colors  also it is not a dc film that is not a 3 hours boring nothingness i would say that is enough to make it likable  all of that dont take away really from the cliche script  the terrible dialogue  the bad performances all over the place and the stinking jokes other than some it is so bad it is funny moments it didnt make me even chuckle  but what made me like it are the visual effects and it didnt take it self seriously so yeah this movie has lots of flaws but it offers a new path for dc and it is always better late than never ,fantasy
everything in this film is terrible story just skips like a very flat stone on the water surface and makes absolutely no proper sense character development is very bad and there are even random and completely unnecessary there is an extra villian character who gets more personal scenes for development than the main villian character and the main female character combined and the guy gets killed immediately with no contribution to the main story there is even a random scene of him spray painting an armor there is so much missing in the films development but they had time to film a scene with random spray painting of a random dude who will just diethe music sounds terrible and does not fade into each other properly it is very very randomthe whole film is like a parody video for the film the problem being that this is the actual film waste of timethe hot guy is good watch the first scene of him going into the submarine and then stop watching and read the comics,fantasy
if you want to see fish colored all forms of and you do not have time to go to an oceanarium this might be the movie youre looking forin the other hand if you like to watch movies that tells a story forget it all aboutthis is not the movie you needwhy did willem dafoe accepted being part of this  movie so fine actorsometimes i just cant understand hes just therehe trhows 2 or 3 stupid lines and thats it gosh deplorableand nicole nicole what are you doing i just cant understandoh and spoilers does this review contain spoilers is it possible what are you talking about theres nothing to spoil about they completely forgot about telling a story here,fantasy
its sad to see movie spending so much money on actors fx and all and not on a good story i was not even able to finish the movie as boring it is,fantasy
this would be a pretty good movie for a 14 year old cheesy lines and predictable dialogue i dont think it was far off being a good movie but it feels like the stupid people in the room had too much of the final sayits like they took bits from our favourite underdog movies  such as the karate kid style ending  and pieced them all together its patchy and weirdly paced with parts that have too much pointless detail while other sections rush ahead and ruin the moment or just execute it poorlywonder woman is still the only decent dc movie since christian bale ceased playing the part of batman,fantasy
nothing works here except the fireworks and poor cgi moments that turn into blubbery children colors under water poor jason momoa isnt a character who should talk very much but they believed in him and they believed he could make jokes and they were wrong his first sentence is so dumb and unfunny that it is probably the worst superhero sentencecharacterisation i have ever heard may some kids laugh out loud they should it is made for themall in all the characters are without soul and sense all in all it was a waste of time under water where everybody can talk and shake out their hair and if you fight down there its like up in the air so the only difference is your hair will be flying and this makes it look like a roughed up version of the mermaid meets star wars meets the lego movie without lego figuresbut all in all it tastes the same,fantasy
blimey i thought it was just mebut hollywood just cant seem to get the dc superhero thing right can theyok  the bale batmans were great so at least they did achieve somethingbut wonder woman justice league recent supermanthey are all a bit  mehi mean they look pretty and theres action but i found myself fiddling with my phone when there was a big fight scene and i had no compassion for any of the characters all dc heros just pose around with the im too cool attitude and you know theyll win the day with no real problemsany they forever seem to steal ideas from marvelthankfully i didnt go to the cinema for this movie,fantasy
i heard broke box office records and it was going to define the dceu but this movie is awful id rather watch batman v superman again before i watch this cheesy crap show of a movie if anyone is reading this review switch to your nearest mcu movie,fantasy
i wasnt very impressed with justice league and the first introduction of quite frankly the character didnt do much for me to begin with subsequently i was pretty sure i wasnt going to like this movie man i was wrong very wrong this movie is one hell of a ride from start to finishlets start with the cgi because it is present in abundant amounts it is very well done but sometimes nears the point of being too much especially towards the end for me personally it never did cross that border though because of the simple reason that it has its place it makes sensethe musical score ranging from orchestral to 80s synth is a weird mix of awesomeness is this a case of catching a ride on the bandwagon of what seems to work for other moviesshows maybe but it works and im digging it it never goes overboardthe movie doesnt take itself too serious but still manages to stay serious enough for you too care about what happens theres no unfunny joke every two minutes there are some though which didnt bother meusually this type of movie features a onedimensional plain evil villain with a simple agenda to rule the world well this movie is actually no different however it also features a bunch of villains which arent quite that its not near as black and white as you may expectstorywise its simple and predictable but the story is there and it works its a superhero action movie folks not hamlet enjoy the rideall in all great stuff must see for superhero movie fans definitely one of the better if not the best dc superhero movie of recent years9510 go see it,fantasy
ill keep this review short and handy for your decision making whether to watch it or notlike all the superhero movies this one is1 one dimensional2 has a terrible cliche plot3 overthetop eye exhausting cgithe actors did a decent job not great but decentsome of the fight scenes were well executed and i enjoyed themthats it nothing less nothing more,fantasy
this movie was so ridiculously overthetop and outrageous it had to have been directed by michael bay it was at least as bad as transformers revenge of the fallen theres nothing but a nonstop special effects klusterfuk it wasnt just bad it was really bad jason momoa is fine but i dont understand why people like him so much hes just kind of scruffy and blah amber heard was just okay but at least she looked hot as a redhead other than amber heard looking like a grown up ariel from the little mermaid there wasnt much else good about the movie,fantasy
i liked seeing all the sea creatures and ocean structures and vehicles this kind of immersive world building reminds me of avatar some of the jokes were also funny and the actors playing and mera were charismaticbut man was that story lame and clich another righteous king returning to the throne story another halfbrotherfamily member competing for that same crown ive seen this play out in one too many times in superhero franchises like thor black panther inhumans etc  some doing it worse than but some also doing it better with a tighter pacing of the plot,fantasy
i got too analytical with the movie and made a long list of all physics defying things in it how on earth did they manage to speak underwater and without spurting out air bubbles i guess comics aint for me,fantasy
visualsaction scenesdevelepmentsatmosphere is perfect,fantasy
im not really a fan of dc movies but i really like this one the visual effects scripts actorsactress were great and everythings going as what i expect there wasnt a scene were you get bored its a type of movie that you dont want to miss every single words of what they say,fantasy
the worst movie ever if you see anyone that give this 10 points it must be his first moviescenario acting directing cgi everything is just terrible,fantasy
james wan certainly produced a better enjoyable dc film than the previous ones in the line but however it fails at a number of places firstly the logic didnt add up it was plain stupid i know you dont need logic but this was pure stupidity secondly orm didnt really feel like a villain he was weak and pathetic even steppenwolf appeared to be a more challenging one than orm was i had keep manta in the main villain but lets skip that i do feel it was a bit rushed there was a lot of plot holes and off topic or unnecessary scenes not to mention it became boring and cringe more it advanced to the end,fantasy
this was one of the worst films ive ever seen the script made titanic sound like shakespeare the visual effects were completely overdone and the acting is so superficial  its like the lines are being delivered by a group of unenthusiastic 5th formers in the worlds worst school play there was no real emotion no sense of peril and even willem dafoe seemed wooden depressing the worlds longest and least inspiring timotei ad,fantasy
this movie is the best of all the superhero movies ive seen,fantasy
i had my doubts and yes it is perfect but the visual eye and mastermind of director james wan will leave you breathless the movie may not be perfect for you but it will definitely make you rewatch it in awe true art of directing what may have been a mediocre film jameswan,fantasy
if you want an action movie with great characters sexy actors great sets great story phenomenal dialogue terrific cgi and a wonderful script this movie has it alla wonderful old time saturday matinee adventure flick,fantasy
i watched it a day after it came out and after recently rewatching it i decided to write a review virtually everything about the movie is on point jason momoa made a hero fans can love and relate tothe visuals the storyline the acting the humor name is breathtaking ocean master is an amazing villain black manta is badassso much potential with this guy and i see 2 being much better than this one and meras first kiss was delayed in order to tease the audience and its one of the captivating moments in the film that would make you smile also atlantis is a beautiful place,fantasy
great movie its real fun to watch the cgi is fantastic action screens are realistic much better than the ant something film not the best dc movie but better than most marvel movies,fantasy
i purchased this on blue ray it was a fun time good action fun twist super cgi,fantasy
this is another attempt for dc to rise and shine it sort of rises but doesnt go far enough to keep dc afloat no pun intended it has a lot of flash and flare but it doesnt have the strongest story and the cgi is still very offputting like every other dc movie from man of steel and onward i like jason mamoa i kind of like amber heard but thats about it the humor is actually kind of good but again doesnt keep the movie on its feet its a funish experience to see once but once is definitely enough,fantasy
it never seemed as an super hero reel as the story and action were played out so naturally i felt i was watching star wars indiana jones and avatar all in one movie no wonder this has been a blockbuster my only regert is that i could not watch this at the cinema,fantasy
much better than batman v superman and justice league the graphics were good and cgi was defo enjoyable 710,fantasy
love me films me but could of done this film in 90 mins became a bore,fantasy
great story the idea of an hidden world a lost world still existing and their inhabitants superbeings is awsomethe script though is bad like cheap movie bad clichethen of course theres jason  and nither arthur nor are suited for himgreat movie ,fantasy
so finally watched and i must say this movie is so much better than black panther in terms of vfx story and acting jason momoa is superb the fight scenes are awesome its a shame black panther got more awards and recognition than this just because of political bs,fantasy
i watched the other day  it shocked me so i watched it again yesterday to make sure it was a bad movie  not just in my head or because of my mood it was bad reallythrowing in a beautiful girl  a couple of cheap jokes does not make for a good film no matter how hard the crew tries or how good a job does the cgi team they dont compensate for a miserable screenplay take this dialogue for example how did you find me black manta your lady friend has people who like to keep tabs on her are you serious the infamous fearsome pirate gives away such advantage just like that when the villain is dumbed down the protagonist gets dumbed down as well it was a great opportunity to make mira look smart but the writers were not clever enough to seize it and this dumb person can take apart a prototype atlantian weapon  turn it into a helmet that very much sums up the consistency in the storyand if the goal was to surprise the audience by revealing that his mother the queen of atlanta was alive  struggling all these years you shouldnt have mentioned her being sacrificed three times prior to her reappearanceadditionally whoever said the gaps in the story could be filled with music is gravely mistaken the music is so loud  varied that it sometimes overshadows even the actors  actresses performancefinally the worst issue what made me see red is the callous use of the oceanspollution issue the makers of this flawed film have had the audacity to take advantage of such dire problem of our time just to make more money they have cheapened the serious concerns regarding this phenomenonit is better to make no film at all than to make a wretched one based on beloved characters the sooner you learn this the less credibility  profits you loose think of all the resources wasted in the process,fantasy
a fresh take on the dceu is nestled somewhere between epic  camp its obvious that they were going for a more marvellike vibe and they almost succeed where they come short is the writing as some scenes are so over the top that they are almost groaninducing like the one on the italian island but it seems like they almost embrace it on that note i liked how they tackle  try to explain all the illogical concepts from the comics before people can criticize themthere are some good action set pieces however it seems like were just going from one to the next and the scenes in between are treated like filler the cgi is good although very comic book like at times which i guess is on purposealtogether a fun romp although a bit tiring at times65,fantasy
i feel like i will be writing good review since i am a dc fanvisuals the visuals and graphics works are stunning maintaining a good light and dark part of the movie specially underwater visuals are good enoughcharacters the characters are the ones who didnt get enough rating from meexcept the main character i really couldnt connect with other characters all of the characters are same their depth wasnt brought up the movie didnt do them justicestory the story seems a little bit off but it was good enough i mean it is more than good for mescreenplay the screenplay was better than other dceu movies i really feel that the actors gave their best and it workedsoundtrack the best dceu movie if ranked by soundtrack at some point you can really feel the energyoverall a 8 from me,fantasy
this film is far more then that i though love the story and the story telling from the film maker,fantasy
 presents a pretty fun movie experience overall great visuals of course but a decent story as well that stays trueish to the source material what liberties they did take worked for the most parteasily the most approachable dc movie for most people and unlike the others in this franchise it isnt perpetually dark and grim jason m whom i hate in 90 of his movies does a great job and presents a charismatic version of arthur we dont generally getthough it should be said the jokes about it being wet thor are pretty accurate not so much from a story front but from a stylistic and mood point of view,fantasy
i rarely review movies but when i do it is because they made an impression  either for worse or betteri am happy to say report that this movie was of the latter categorythe avalanche of superhero movies being thrown at audiences in recent years has left me somewhat numb and hard to impress  a cgi spectacle alone no longer impresses the way it used to but applied as it was here  to show us an entire new world in explicit detail  was a feat to take note of just wowyes the movie has all the clichs but it also has humor and charm in spades  and it cares about its story and characters  without taking itself too seriouslygotta hand it to jason momoa  i think he nailed it about as well as robert downeyironman most enjoyable character in a long time congratulationsas for the director  i certainly hope james wan will be back for the sequel which should be a certainty now that the movie has done appropriately well at the box office outstanding job sirthe only thing that i can point my finger at would be that the chemistry between momoa and heard didnt exactly throw sparks  but was merely adequatefor me this was a great movie  if you are looking for entertainment look no further,fantasy
going into this movie i thought it would be like the rest of the dceu being dark and ugly like bvs but i was very surprised by how great and different it was i found that the best scenes were the ones under water just before watching it i thought that the scenes under water were going to look werid because of how much it was going to be cgi but i found that all of the scenes looked amazing the actors like jason momoa and amber heard were so good in this flim i didnt really like in justice league but in this i felt more for the character i also love the script in this movie the script in justice league felt weird and cheesy the villains like ocean master and black manta were some of the best villans since zod in man of steel i just wish there was more screen time for black manta overall i loved this movie and would recommend it to any super hero fan,fantasy
 doesnt feel like any other superhero movie its more adventurous funny the action doesnt stop you dont feel bored watching it it has its own plot flaws and had some lack of characters motives but the way things go on make you forget about it and enjoy it i recommend this movie i love it,fantasy
great movie after long timei like the actuons and the story of this moviebut not great movie for all peoplewe need to look how difficult to make this conseptthank you dc,fantasy
this is one of the best super hero movies i have ever seen visuals are amazing if someone says this film is boring i just cant imagine what he expects from a super hero movie i rate this movie better than black panther highly recommended,fantasy
amazing movie from start to finish unbelievable scenes under the ocean a very colourful picture the acting was awesome was awesome the story was fantastic great action scenes i no its fantasys but its a nice thought to think that the underwater city was true  must see movie ,fantasy
this is a movie about possiden for those of you not acquainted with possiden he was one of the twelve olympians in ancient greek religion and myth he was god of the sea and other waters of earthquakes and of horses so while they make this out to be no its not having said that its a great film especially if seen on an imax 2d not 3d screen for that fully immersive experience the male and female leads are great the supporting characters are great if you like really cool special effects great acting and a solid tale you will love this film there is nothing not to like plus i took my wife with me and she loved it too,fantasy
over 80 on imdb gave this movie above 5 stars so im glad that this movie was able to make that many people happy but this movie was in my opinion made for the kids as superhero movies really was meant to be however with the era of marvel and its absolute brilliance in making even the most unlikeliest of heroes such as ironman captain americaantman as popular superheroes as superman batman and spiderman  this movie was below average  horrible shiny colorful suits  continuity errors immensely predictable and done to death with story line childish humor high pitched noisy sound almost throughout the entire movie  the production the script and the direction all seemed lazy but like i said im happy that at least others liked it,fantasy
there were some visually interesting scenes otherwise it was as ridiculous and banal as wonder woman black panther venom etc etcits unfair to the cast  crew apart from the decision makers who work their behinds off in trying to make the trite formula work albeit in vaini dont know when will the studios start putting some effort into the storylines instead of just pouring cash in to make every movie visually as huge as possible without any hint of worthy content,fantasy
the storyline is childish dialogues are immature it brutally shattered all my expectations from a movie which is said to be the highest grossing dc movie in entire history batman series was atleast 10times betterthe only thing worth watch watching in the entire movie was the sizzling superhot amber heard,fantasy
cgi overload  checksuper predictable schlock  checkmain characters yelling every time something important happens  checkthings that make drunkstoned people go oooohhhh  checkwell developed story  negativeability to identify with any of the characters  negativemystery subtlety charisma  negativedesire to see a sequel  negativesuper disappointed with this one i mean was already one of the least popular super hero characters  why would you butcher it like thisthis is probably the worst super hero movie ive seen in a while i wanted to like it i love basically all of the marvel and dc movies but this one just left me wanting soo much more the character development is done halfheartedly and they just tried to push way too much history into a single film perhaps because of this its hard to identify with any of the charactershey im the drunk ripped and hardcore rabblerousing son of a queen from worlda who is super arrogant for two hours but somehow acts humble in the last 10 min of the moviehey im the superhot daughter of royalty from worldb who doesnt like her arranged marriage and can basically kick everybodys butt without trying but ill be vulnerable just for you  perfect strangerive got an idea lets do stuff together and change worlda and worldb sorry for the excessively detailed plot synopsis but thats all folksif you want to take a few hits and enjoy some very well done visuals then this movie will probably give you a fun 25 hrs  but if you actually want a movie that sticks with you and makes you want more try again i will not watch the planned sequel,fantasy
best story and action jason nailed the role of cherrs,fantasy
it was just too much 5 out of 10 stars because it didnt suck and i actually did enjoy it it just needed more story and less action the dceu deserves some actual storytelling,fantasy
and not good cheesy silliness i cant believe the hi caliber actors who lent their reputation to this flashy junk excepting amber heard,fantasy
 was absolutely awesome to watch james wan did a fantastic job with all the action and all the fun this is why you go to the movies,fantasy
first let me say this movie is most entertaining regardless of the people who watch it to find things wrong hey nimrods its a movie pay your money and enjoy the ride the special effects were superb the acting believable only i would have chosen and different person to play but hey you go with what you gotin 2015 warner brothers released an animated movie called justice league throne of atlantis this movie is like the live action version of the 2015 movie there are a few subtle changes but the basic concept is the same guess its art imitating artfor those who want to tear this movie apart you are missing the joy of watching an entertaining movie i say your ticket take your seat eat your popcorn and dont spill the drink on the floor and enjoy the rideunlike marvel there are no super heroes fighting super heroes for two hours this is an action movie of the good kind who cares if they use wrong words to identify things if you watch most period piece movies people are using words and terminology that wasnt invented in their time its called a movie for a reason they are made for the entertainment value and not for its historical content its called taking creative licensing rocks,fantasy
i am a huge marvel fan and i own probably 95 of all marvel movies at home and have collected marvel comics and cards during my childhood and i have to say this was a dc film done right i gave this a 10 because i truly believe this movie had everything humour drama action and fantasy the only dc films this competes with are the batman films directed by christopher nolan that is how great this movie is again this is coming from a marvel fan and it is very difficult for me to enjoy dc films but damn this was a great one i am definitely getting this when it comes out on bluray and it will probably my only dc movie on bluray unless they keep making dc films like this for anyone who has not seen this yet definitely make time to watch it it is a great film,fantasy
this is like a bad overly long and boring episode of the power rangers go home dc youre drunk,fantasy
 is the best action movie ive ever seenits about arthur curry the son of atlantis queen and a normal human he thinks his mother is dead because when he was 3 years old she was arrested by the forces of atlantis arthur is now 30 years old and mera the actual princess of atlantis has asked him to go on a quest they must research a trident to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and the humansthis is an action adventure and fantasy movie it was produced by dc comics the company who has produced justice league this movie is 143 minutes long so it is extremely short for an action filmabout the cast jason momoa and amber heard are the funniest actors for an action film they form an explosive and emotive duo and it was incredibly funny to follow this strange squad during the filmthis film is actionpacked the wars between atlantis and the humans the powers of and mera so the visuals are terrific that explains the budget of 160 000 000 the score of this movie is disappointing and it doesnt correspond to the movieso to summarize thank you dc comics for this magnificent film it makes me laugh it makes me happy and it is entirely original and funlast but not least the scene when finally meets his mother is the greatest moment of the film because it was full of emotion and very beautiful,fantasy
 is a traditional fantasy plot youve seen 10000 times however one thing the movie has that a lot of those fantasy films lacked is heartthis is a superhero film that doesnt take itself serious and doesnt care to just sit back relax and enjoy the film for what it is a superhero movie,fantasy
no depth whatsoever i feel like dumb people would find this movie clever,fantasy
i have to admit i initially had low expectations for this movie considering most of the other movies in the dceu sucked but i was pleasantly surprised by there are so many things to love about this movie firstly the casting i cant think of a more fitting actor to play than jason momoa he was perfect in the role i didnt really care for before but jason really brought a charm to the character hes witty hes charming hes humble and hes relatable unlike other superheros doesnt gloat about being a hero and he was reluctant to become king of atlantis but he reluctantly became a hero  king because he felt he needed to in order to protect the people he loved and not because he wanted glory is a very unique superhero and his personality is different to most other superheroes now has become 1 of my fav superheros love mera too shes strong  a hero in her own right shes no damsel in distress and i think amber heard did a good job with the character nicole kidman was also good as mother i also like some of the other supporting cast  characters including willem dafoe as vulko and temuera morrison as father all these characters are likable the visual effects  cgi were stunning i really dont understand why some of the negative reviews would say the visuals were horrible because theyre not at all the visuals were so spectacular and beautiful  top notch and so realistic theyre some of the best visuals i have ever seen in any movie even better than the visuals in most of the mcu movies the cinematography is also great and the transitions between the scenes flows smoothly i enjoy the action scenes too i also love the music especially the themesong everything i need by skylar grey its a beautiful song the storyline was a bit simple  straightforward but easy to follow and while the movie did have lot of the typical superhero cheesiness  cliches surprisingly that didnt bother me because i was so invested in the characters and the visuals  cinematography and music some people think jason  amber lacked chemistry but i disagree i think they still had some chemistry they didnt have the best chemistry together but i didnt see any awkwardness between them either there were some very touching moments between the characters throughout the movie which got me emotional especially the scenes between parents  the ending scene was really powerful  beautiful it really resonated with menow to the negatives well there really wasnt many flaws for me i suppose the duration of the movie was abit too long for such a straightforward  simple storyline the movie definitely couldve reduced its run time  i dont think it wouldve affected the overall storyline almost 23 hours is abit too long for a superhero movie the dialogue was a bit cheesy at times and i think some of the humor was a little forced but i like the humor most of the time and the villains were rather uninteresting to me especially black manta he didnt really have a big role in the movie he was there mainly to serve a personal vendetta against but his role just seemed insignificant and didnt contribute much i think the movie still wouldve worked without him in it and prince orm aka ocean master unlike most evil villains in superhero movies that are typically one dimensional and just wanted to destroy the world orms motives were understandable  that made him a more complex villain but still i didnt really care for his character much as the main antagonist in the movie orm was rather weak and not hardcore enougheven with these flaws i think the positives still outweigh the negatives and its still a fun and entertaining movie overall and visually beautiful to watch and more lighthearted than all the other dc movies ive seen i thoroughly enjoyed a lot from start to finish and i would even go so far as to say that i think this is one of the better superhero movies ive ever watched and i have watched many dc and marvel movies over the years i enjoyed watching even more than most of the marvel movies ive watched and this is surprising to even myself because i usually prefer marvel movies  im one of those people who often mocks how terrible most of the dceu movies are so its surprising that i could love a dceu movie more than i do with most marvel movies and yet that is exactly the case with this movie is a pleasant surprise for me i initially didnt think i would like but i ended up loving it and loving jason momoa and the other casts this movie has become 1 of my fav superhero movies of alltimei give a solid 910,fantasy
this is the second best movie in the dc cinematic universe next to wonder woman i think the only character that i knew before watching the movie was black manta hes actually the secondary villain as the main one is half brother i admit that i can tell that the director saw the thor movies even bulk is like thors probably this films biggest strengths is how beautiful and colorful it is the earth is mostly covered in water so it only makes sense we should have movies that take place underwateri do wish that black manta was in this more it does get kind of too silly at times especially with how they suddenly have monsters and dinosaurs randomly appear theres still no doubt that this is a very creative film while not as good as black panther or avengers infinity war its still a film people should watch if only because of how popular it is trust me when i say theres tons of great action and creativity everywhere yes we get a nice romance story in toobut not as good as thors ,fantasy

i believe that is a sorry excuse for a movie and i will not change my mind i started believing this right after the movie ended i think that this belief is rational as the plot of a movie is extremely important and this movie has so many plot holes that its basically swiss cheese nothing could change my mind even if the movies lack of continuity was an artistic decision to comment on movies with a lack of continuity the movies attempt is way too unintentional to ever pass as one this belief is very strong maybe unimportant but very strong a significant number of people agree with my belief i would be very disappointed in the world and film experts if they rate as a good movie,fantasy
that was the best dc film ive ever seenbetter than justice leaguejasom is a great actori want to see him as aquman in the future,fantasy
the films plot is complex and fascinating but the end is a bit awkward,fantasy
so despite some user and critics negative reviews many people loved this movie i certainly did,fantasy
awesome movie all up down to toes is great the most recognizable i can say is the style the director james wan puts in the movie with all the moves of the camera the angles shots incrediblethe story plays the action blows minds the screenplay the locations the cast play such a great movie and most important with all touching feelings you sense the emotions which many blockbusters doesnt have in large specter of variety that is it great,fantasy
its another superhero movie its goodnot great but good i am not going to be a long winded reviewer if you like superhero movies watch it its better than average just my opinion,fantasy
very watchable and adds value to the origin character development for dc,fantasy
i am not a big fan of superhero movies but this one is the best that i have seen,fantasy
with all that money youd think they wouldnt be able to fail the cgi in this movie was in parts laughable some of the dialog was awful some of the acting worse and some of the casting dolph lungdren if youre 10 then youll probably love this but for me it fell well short of what i expected the whole dead mother probably but who knows maybe living in an impossible situation for 30 yearsthing was clearly rippedoff from the antman michelle pfeiffer part too,fantasy
i went to go see this a couple of weeks ago and i enjoyed it but since then ive went to go see it one more time and i didnt get any good things from that rewatch,fantasy
ive watched this movie twice now after watching it the first time i found it hard to escape the realisation of how ridiculous the whole thing is that being said i also found it entertaining that was the first time though the second time i watched it was about a month later viewing movies twice is often a valuable experience quite often you spot little things you missed the first time around but which add to the appreciation of the film sadly with what i spotted was the movies flaws how really banal the dialogue is how bad the acting is and how preposterous the plot is i missed those nuances the first time as i was bombarded by the spectacle of it all on second viewing even that spectacle seemed cartoonish and obviously cgiheavy the writers hardly miss a superhero movie cliche in this story the movie tries to take a tongueincheek approach at times but the humour is quite lame much of what is enjoyable about this movie can be attributed to the charisma of jason mamoa who plays arthur curry  the first polynesian superhero his scarcely resembles the character found on television and in comic books and is in some respects almost an antihero hes not deadpool but hes going in that direction jason mamoa isnt a great actor im not even sure hes a good actor but hes certainly charismatic and i guess thats what matters most in this type of film it also helps that this movie doesnt spend the first hour or so explaining the origins of the main character before he is seen on the screen instead his story is told in flashback form throughout the movie maybe thats because his back story isnt really that interesting and can be dealt with quickly but anyway the cast surrounding mamoa is pretty dull and includes all the perfunctory nods to being racially inclusive it also includes the obligatory big stars playing mentoring roles to the main protagonist although willem dafoes cheesy character will make you laugh or maybe grimace though not intentionally and nicole kidman will make you yawn as usual julie andrews even turns up or at least her voice does playing what must be one of the more unusual characters of her careerclosing credits make it obvious that this movie is set up for a sequel and imdb reports that one is scheduled for 2022 i look forward to seeing that it will have to be better than thismy conclusion turn your brain off dont expect too much and you will probably enjoy this movie  the first time just dont rush to watch it again,fantasy
the movie started off great and i was excited that dc had finally made another good movie such as wonder woman but the movie just went down hill way to fast even the soundtrack was off in an odd way please stop rushing movies jason m and this cast deserved a great movie and ended with eh that was alright,fantasy
the king of the 7 seas proved his point however i would have loved to see one or two members of the justice league at the end of the film most notably the green lantern whom i know has to be in justice league 2 since he is a founding member i want to say that one of the best parts of the film besides jason who is just the best there has ever been in fact hes even better than the rest of the justice league members you guys may have to recast the rest of the team and just start over begin with a real well don green lantern and the whole green lantern corps and color ring wars which is just a mind blowing storyline and the parallax story line as part of the trilogy must not be left out and we want the real hal jordan as green lantern this time none of that riding in a rollercoaster as in the last movie which i liked but there are better and more visually striking ways to use his powers like powerful green cyber armors giant robot suits powerful blast and feats of superhuman strength with the green energy etc ultimately green lantern must join the group and have his movie just put it in the right directors hands and it will go well back to i love the whole ocean philosophy and raising awareness about very real issues this is very important and should remain a theme for the next two films i love the oceanography and many of the cgi were great especially some of the encounters he has they are really great except for the octopus scene you know the one come on stop that suit  the chainmail should be smaller it looks plastic as it is and plastic also the scene at the end of the film the cgi looks fake i hope the cgi will look much better in the other films merma was great and must remain throughout the film nicole kidman was also great and likewise must remain in fact all the cast members did a wonderful job i would love to see the costumes look better more convincing and the strange races are fantastic and should be looked into more in the coming films as should the monsters and all the strange history artifacts and the action scenes all add to the intrigue keep it coming you had everyone eating out of your hands thats why this film grossed so much and is on the top 25 of all time grossing films  final word when they face darkseid it should all lead up to it after we get to know everyone and seen their movies and there should be cameos from group members to show cohesion and the cgi has to be top notch,fantasy
after marvel just simply crushing dc didnt disappoint its very decent for a dcmovie,fantasy
of course nice but predictable some easy jokes around there some effects their and voila,fantasy
honestly the trailer was far more interesting poor choice of costume and a very weak plot,fantasy
this movie was such a disappointment the terrible script mediocre acting and poor attempts at comedy black manta looked like he should be fighting the power rangers which was a better movie in my opinion,fantasy
i would rather watch some superman movies from the 80s at a time when real actors were in the movies not these bunch of muscle cgi photoshop mixture nobodies sorry for the once real actors who gave their names not act for this misery called movie i have to admit that this one was a bit better than the usual marvel trash hence the 3 stars and not one,fantasy
the story is quite good but the whole setup is so bad,fantasy
black panther just underwater with a lame backstory brother wants to kill all humans futurama flashback because they litter the sea so he goes to war to kill off other factions that hes trying to protect,fantasy
i like superhero movies no i love superhero movies marvel dc doesnt matter theyre fun theyre slick good acting and action and compelling stories but this movie none of the above the acting  with talented actors  is like a high school play the characters are wooden and shallow and theres no compelling story that makes you like or identify with any of the characters the story itself is just silly i have no idea who is rating the film highly it really has no redeeming features,fantasy
nice story but effects and costumes are for young children,fantasy
 finally dc hi before i begin the analysis i must say that i am a beginner in this world of human movie criticism im brazilian my english is mehdo you like a fun movie full of surprising and frantic action scenes to the point of impressing the viewer at any time correct movie do you prefer welldeveloped characters and a script that is minimally credible and does not abuse of the cliches wrong movie from the very beginning we have unprecedented destruction the film minimally tries to stop to introduce its characters in a way that provokes the affection of the public this simply occurs naturally with the course of the scenes lets say at least we have some dialogues geared toward a basic introduction of what is happening and things to provoke the comic side to the end other than that explosions arthur is by far the only character with a miniarc of presentation as the narrative unfolds between flashbacks and present events not to curl up since everyone has a sentimental connection to each other and only complements something for the publics understanding the arc does not take much of the film which is good and does not arouse the boredom of the viewer moreover the performance is good enough to portray with skill the strong personality of the protagonist who although theoretically very generic can take advantage of the clichs in a good way and improve the reputation that the hero has here i would say that despite using the clichs in a good way abuses this for example the relationship of our couple is totally superficial being moved and carried by a meager clichs of comedy and also conveniences of action it can be said that amber heard does not shine or cause fascination because her character is very superficial which possibly hindered her performance coloring the tedious is difficult mera is used as a convenient tool more than is used as a character black mamba demonstrates an interesting potential however it is forgotten and used in a confusing way being a simplistic opposition to the main objective and appearing at random as a script convenience the matches are short with tactics worthy of power rangers and may rather disappoint the fans in the meantime our antagonist is acceptable the action reinforces well its ideals and brings to the fore that in the end it is not only an opposition to the others but yes someone who does not understand or accepts facts being minimally humanized in its choices and slightly different from what we are accustomed to even though it is completely clich and having almost nonexistent development i believe that at least we have a potential for continuation other presences media have only the value of supplementing the narrative and do not necessarily give much emphasis to something nor do they sketch out prominence with some exceptions in certain scenes still the cast is very generic simple and poorly developed the script however far from being a wonder is very predictable and simple can impress because well most of the cliches are well used in addition the direction manages to catch the viewer in some moments although it can not be called primordial the action however is quite convenient at times and there are yes many repetitive scenes to break the spectators expectation but obviously few are caught by surprise currently it would be more surprising if nothing happened the script prolongs through unnecessary comedy the romance of the main couple only obviously to receive this in the end in a moment of peace generic is relative however i would say that the movie is medium in this regard other than that the ending is a stereotype used positively you can not count predictability as a grotesque mistake as we already knew that this premise of ideological battles would engender such a feat even more so in a movie of a independent hero however the film is filled with grotesque conveniences and occasional to the extreme misrepresenting even the sense of some things or generating flaws and holes as has been said action is impressive and frenetic now combine with the fundamental and beautiful design the best part armor faithful to the hqs without removing representative details they do not look like a cosplay either which is great everything is well detailed and immersive the effects do not sin so much only in some moments soon they enter yes in the standard quality of films of heroes of the present time the comedy of the movie is really bad if you are already accustomed to several movies of the genre since the jokes are only recycled from other works being direct is incredible for those who seek to have fun or for those who praise cliche heroism final grade 5 define well medium but fun,fantasy
hahaha that was a pun or word play or somethingooooookay on to the business at hand the moviei try to see every comic book movie that comes down the pike i went into this one not expecting mush the character came across as an obnoxious frat boy in the justice league movie and i figured this one was just a showcase for momoa and his pecs and tattoos  pecs and tats might have been a great title for the movie i thoughtwell was i pleasantly surprised it was actually pretty entertaining it was fun and had some nice bits of comedy and the action was good the cinematography in real world settings like the small village where arthur first encounters black manta was really good and momoa might not be a great actor but he did have good chemistry with all his costarswhile it wasnt a great movie like say logan it delivered fun and action and adventure pretty much everything you could want out of a good solid comic book movie as a matter of fact i liked it so much i saw it twice,fantasy
yeah as i expectedthe story is nicebut the whole movie cannot give us expectation that when we feel the name of moviebur sure that we can watch it never bores uvisual effect is awesomesome flawness is mirroring but totally it dissapoints methe mesaage of movie is brilliantly donea great thanks to dci think that should get massive importness to atlanta withouy fighting but knowing him the true onethat could be nicebut anyway good movieenjoy it guysfor me its 7,fantasy
its a good movie but not a good finishing it can be better finish up,fantasy
didnt expect much and wasnt really disappointedthe story was 100 predictable everything was obvious from the start and there was really nothing the movie couldve impressed me witharound 70 of the dialogue was expository 20 was people saying really stupid things and 10 of really awkward humor i did laugh at some of the lines though but those were unintentionally funny they did sometimes make fun of some things showing that they are aware of some of the stupidities they have there only to stay true to the source material they did however spend a lot of effort to make sure you understand everything that is going on everything that happens or even gets mentioned is explained in a flashback scene or by characters in full even before the giant sea beast attacks it makes sure to give you some exposition at firstmost of the visuals were ok but not very creative or interesting they did have some good ones though like 2 or 3 from the top of my head the starting lighthouse fight scene was cool the trench dive and the wine magic scenes were also pleasant to the eyemost of the acting was good wouldve been strange if it was otherwise with such cast except for our two leads mera and arthur i didnt like both as a character and momoas performance first they set him up as a guy with super powers and an enormous ego i though this was made intentionally to show his path and his growth as a character in the end but this wasnt the case he just was lucky to get a better weapon and randomly rescue his mom in the process side quests right hes still the same egocentric guy with super powers and this is pretty much what he was the movie even emphasizes on that since the ending is extremely dull they even go for the basic become the king and get the girl thing super onedimensional im not familiar with the source material so maybe this was just them staying loyal just as having a laughable costume for the black mantameras motivation as a character was unclear yet she seems to care so much not sure about what particularly throughout the movie she was ruined mostly by amber heards performance she was horrible she didnt care for a second about her acting and it was obvious they did gave her nothing to work with though shes just a plot device a girl the main guy gets in the end at least i did enjoy her costume there was also some sort of an environmental message but it was so bleak i almost forgot about this when i finished the moviethe main problem of this movie is that its around 7 years late this wouldve worked so much better if made around 2012 the hero is not impressive the story is not particularly interesting the lore is stupid and unintentionally funnythey did know what they were doing and there clues in the movie to substantiate that i dont think that there was a better way to make an movie but this is still instantly forgettable,fantasy
so the costumes were amazing the story was great and i couldnt believe how good the acting and action was probably one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,fantasy
great story linegreat fight scencesvery action packed,fantasy
i believe that dc is learning how to make great moviesthis is super funny has drama action comedy beautiful costumes and nicole kidman  and momoa amazing,fantasy
dont come back zach sniderever neverlook at the terrible movies justice league and batman vs superman disaster movies created by zach snider,fantasy
i cant tell you how many times i noticed something amiss in this movie only to have the pace and sheer likability of it have me forget about it almost immediately visually its stunning and once you get the idea fun to watchshakespeare it aint but somehow the movie manages to make it all work the dialog is cheesy and many interactions are camp i mean what other superhero movie can you think of that tries to make us feel something for a bad guy that just killed a bunch of innocent people okay maybe loki but in the same scene or one that has an endless kiss that takes place in lieu of the hero stopping the carnage of a major battle that latter was a bit much for me but heyobviously the movie doesnt want you to take anything too seriously so dont just sit back and enjoy a nearly endless stream of fascinating visuals and action sequences and the offkilter approach it looks like they had lots of fun making it and that comes through,fantasy
i am a huge super heroes fan and 2016 was a dissapointing year beacause of the 2 dc movies that were relesed that year batman vs superman and suicide squad but after watching i forgot about those movies was a awsomefunny and awsome super heroe jason momoa make an awsome interpretation of and special effect are just gorgeous this is a tru dc movie,fantasy
i finally got the chance to see this movie in 3d which wasnt so great btw and honestly saying i wasnt disappointed many people including the critics have praised this movie for being only fun or putting the accent on good old fun but in my opinion this movie has much more to it than that the only reason i didnt gave this movie a ten is because overall is a bit cliched at times and overall the stakes arent that high really to make you surprised or mind blown by what turns this movie took along its 142 minutes run timethe story many people have compared this movie with black panther or lion king but the story although being about someone who steps up to be the king of his people is quite different the main difference is that arthur doesnt want to be king and his character along the journey this movie takes it becomes more selfless and more dedicated to his people or to the saving of his people rather than on some claim he has ill say this first like 20 minutes of this movie are awesome with a backstory that was touching powerful and memorable the movie loses its tempo only in the middle but you never lose the plot if you pay attention i will also point out the development of arthurs character and how a certain scene speaks so powerfully about what makes a good leader someone who doesnt think about himself but rather gives everything in him for his people very nicely executed scene and one more reason why this movie was more than just good fun for methe villain although some people said manta wasnt actually needed in this movie if you really pay attention to the movie youll see he has somewhat of a role in it but the other villain is what makes this movie good orm is very strong of a character and his motivations are very understandable theres a scene between him and arthur in atlantis that displays all his motivation and how humans are responsible for that for me that scene just spoke and raised the problem that we as humans continue to perpetuate upon the environment and how we do everything that we like with it without worrying about its degradation very nice and deep thematicallythe supporting cast was good standard i would say vulko is the mentor mera is the partner along the journey for arthur but the rest which i wont spoil for you two characters are very good even though they dont have that much screen time their story is superb and touching the soundtrack again was very nice done by rupert gregson williams but a little to loud at timesthe visuals this movie is wihtout a doubt the most visual and the most beautifully looking movie ive seen in a long long time it is beyond me how this movie wasnt nominated by the academy btw one of the worst nolinations this year at the academy for visual effects and production design which are incredible well done the amount of work that went in it must have been crazy i couldnt but appreciate all the visuals and the digital altered faces which are quite a few throughout this movieoverall great movie with so much fun and excitement but also with a good and flashed out villain good character development and good enough themes throughout the movie well worth watching stay until the mid credits for the post credits scene that sets up a sequel which hopefully will be made,fantasy
nah its not an disappointment its good start for a new herolike james wan other movies its visually good and in story base toosimply a serious brother fight,fantasy
i enjoyed every second of the movie great acting and story thanks dc for making this wonderful movie i highly rated and recommend,fantasy
up until recently ive always perseived as one of the more laughable superheroes as he has never really been portrayed all that well jason momoas portrayal of has revolutionised his character into something more modern and acceptable in todays pop culture and is doing a great job atfrom start to finish i can honestly say that i really enjoyed whatching it and was thinking throughout that this is probably one of the best dc movies i would even say i put it up there with christopher nolans the dark knight,fantasy
first 10 to 15 mins is really rushed apart from that its a complete entertainerjason mamoa shines as loved patrick wilson as orm  amber heard as mera other casting shines too but the real gem of the movie is james wanwhat a creation what a cinematic experience a must watch ,fantasy
i am a big mcu fan and really did not like the reboot of batman superman and the justice league movies wonder woman was very good but that is it the green lantern was awful this movie was entertaining and had a lot of action with a nice bit of humor aquman is worth the price of admission,fantasy
just proves to show that zack snyder should never have been allowed anywhere near dc,fantasy
 is a watchable film an old superhero formula movie with some excellent vfx a wonderful visual experience with jason mamoa the same cliche dialogue like any other action movie mamoa is perfect as he gave a wonderful performance the rest of the cast was good enoughdc needs more than a simple superhero action film if they want to catch marvel quickly,fantasy
great movie something i would watch again down the line,fantasy
just brilliant brilliant which i watched cause i was bored turned out to be a complete surprise to me just brilliant visuality u can just feel the movie although i am a marvel fan this movie is making me reconsider that,fantasy
awesome movie i enjoyed it from start to finishfinally dc seems to know what the right direction isthe visuals fight scenes and story of this movie are great i hope tht they continue to offer this type of movies in the futurejason momoa turned from a sloppy superhero to a badass one i never thought that i would be hyped to see an movie but this one proved me wornggreat job dc,fantasy
 was the most anticipated movie of 2018 i was so scared to be bad or disappointing and fortunately it wasnt in fact it was great not perfect but still amazing so its time to talk to u guys about this amazing movie so lets get into it is directed by james wan his very first superhero movie screenplay by david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick and will beall and starring jason momoa amber heard willem dafoe patrick wilson and nicole kidmanstory by geoff johns james wan and will beall the film reveals the origin story of halfhuman halfatlantean arthur curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetimeone that will not only force him to face who he really is but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be a kingthis review will be spoilerfree because i dont want to ruin this movie to you guysi really dont know where to start guys lets start with the direction james wans first superhero movie as its director is so i was concerned to see him failing because were used to see him mostly in horror movie like the conjuring universe saw and insidious so yeah i didnt expect him to make a great job with the direction in fact i was blown away of his amazing job with this movie especially with the action scenes he made every single scene epic and breathtaking thanks also goes to the crew of the cgi which im gonna talk about later on james wan did some mistakes with the direction as i predicted when i first heard that he will direct this movie he actually tried to make some jumpscares in this movie for no reason i dont get why let me tell you how most of the normal scenes when people are talking or doing anything but fighting especially when they are in a house or somewhere closed they always ended with someone exploding the wall or anything unexpectedly just like horror movies and thats what i was afraid of thats my only issue with the directionlets move to the flawless cgi every scene of the underwater world was was well made by the cgi and the direction as i said above its amazing i cant find any proper word to say about it it was fascinating i was superentertained by how well done the cgi of this movie is they werent afraid of making that much of atlantis like godzilla did i dont want to compare movies but godzilla was too afraid to make that much of scenes of him but took that risk and they nailed italso the performances were very talented by everyone jason momoa is amazing as as he was in justice league and maybe more amber heard is badass as mera patrick wilson is an amazing villain and i loved him as king orm and i cant wait to see him again in other dc movieslets move to my biggest flaw of this movie and its a random choice i dont know but this might have some spoiler for you theres a scene when and mera were fighting creatures in a boat and in this scene arthur aka said a very random line that these creatures are from the bottom of the sea so they fear the light so he opens a random box to find a light source and he scares the creatures with it this scene was so random the line of can be forgiven but the random choice cant bei tried to make it spoilerfree as i could and i highlighted some keywords which who watched the movie will understand what im talking aboutso for those who want to know if spiderman into the spiderverse is better than or not my opinion is yeah its better than but it also depends on what you want to see if you wanna see an epic old fashioned way superhero movie so is your movie but if you wanna see a surprising and with a very powerful story so spiderman into the spiderverse is your movie anyways i really loved and im gonna give it an aalright guys and thanks for reading my review and if you liked it you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews look forward for my up coming reviews,fantasy
well directed good editing and decent actinggreat supporting cast awesome cgi and action scenes are done well dc are moving in the right direction and hope they keep going that way hopefully they will be a sequeloverall a good solid action film based on the dc comics enjoy fans,fantasy
this movie wasnt on my radar i was thoroughly disappointed by justice league and had zero desire to see this yet as the reviews came in and as jason momoa killed it on the pr trail i finally decided to give it a go and really enjoyed itsome standoutsjason momoa is a star he carried this script with all of its tongueincheek groanworthy lines i read somewhere that he uses metal songs to get into character and that tool was one of his inspirations personally i think tool is a very serious band and so is their frontman maynard but he has a pretty weird sense of humorfor some reason i kept paying attention to the physics  there are a lot of people flying through walls and getting hit really hard you really feel the kinetic force of the actionthe plot is predictable but epic the final battle is outstanding and the world design is colorful interesting and fundceu really steps up the game with this entry into its universe but i dont really see wonder woman super man or batman as having the ability to carry a movie with this level of humor and color theyre going to need to introduce a new team in an alternate setting that can be comical colorful and have a ton of action  i think the lantern corps are going to be the best way even though it was attempted previously,fantasy
the film is a game changer in terms of special effects its up there with avatar if i had seen it in 3 d it would change superheros films for everlets start off with a bit of truth i like i dc comics fan im not saying its a great movie or that its the savior of the dc cinematic universe but it is a lot of fun its a bizarre but weirdly effective movie i cant put it any better than that arthur curry the humanborn heir to the underwater kingdom of atlantis goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and landwith william defoe playing vulko who show aquman how to learn his role with tridentand using his skills he need the back story is good with king orm talking over the king of atlantis when he over throws the and attacks a meeting is forced to fight him in an underwater arena this is epic and mera helps but but as we see nicole kidman character is good givers good advice and was rescued so when aquman has to find the real ruler he must become the hero and go epic and clues to atlantis and its power before its destroyed he has to light the wayi can however give you a few more details we begin with a new version of arthur curry jason momoa who feels more like an aquatic vigilante than the deep sea prince were used to arthurs rogue hero lifestyle leads him into a faceoff with a group of hightech pirates the pirates are lead by david hyde yahya abdulmateen ii and his father jesse michael beach who just so happen to be in the middle of stealing a submarine you know because why not this leads to one of the most emotional scenes of the movie and after its all done arthur and has his first enemy in hyde aka mantathe enemies dont stop there arthur also has an atlantean brother by the name of orm patrick wilson although hed probably prefer king ormbecause hes pretentious that way i mean this guy is the quintessential badnewssibling who might want you dead or imprisoned or just somewhere bleeding cause youre lost to the world the battle under water is like lord of the rings its amazingto counter the forces rising against him arthur has a great dad temuera morrison and a mom nicole kidman who loved them both deeply before she had to leave because you know queen business aint nothing but work he also has a potential crimefighting partner and a love interest in mera amber heard the princess of another underwater kingdomso arthurs life is funbecause he loves dangerand hes a total bad boybut he has a lot to learn about compassion and what being a hero means which is what this movie is aboutso shall we go with the good  the ugly lets do itjason momoa is glorious hes funny charming and tough thats what you want in an and its whats been missing from dc moviesother than wonder woman as his foil yahya abdulmateen ii is the perfect counterbalance his manta formerly black manta is ruthless charming and relentless ive got nothing but applause for these two and ive got big hopes for their rivalry to continue in future filmssecondly dc has found a formula i believe will work well for them as they redevelop and revamp their live action movies1010the computer generated imagery is brill at times like the tsunami and not in a campy way that feels intentional the characters and their hair see tresses move more like theyre flying through air rather than gliding through waterstillits a fun movie jason momoa makes everything better and this represents a first step in dc finally giving their characters and their fans the movies we want and deserve so i say cheers tohis pilsner glass may be far too flashy but at least its filled to the brim with good stuff,fantasy
this movies storyline is standard the acting can be better but the versatile visualization of the underwater world makes up for it it took some years but this movie proves wearing 3dglasses can have added value you really feel you are part the underwater world,fantasy
this film is fantastic movie i watch after long time,fantasy
i am in the minority when it comes to the dc films in that i have enjoyed them all i thought man of steel was an awesome superman film batman versus superman wasnt great but the last portion of the film was good suicide squad was pretty cool and wonder woman well people liked that one i even thought justice league was good and was baffled that it had a disappointing box office take as it was so much better than batman versus superman this one i was not sure of because i just thought it would be difficult to make an interesting movie using only i was wrong and was surprised by how much i enjoyed this filmthe story has coming out into the forefront as he takes out some pirates after we are introduced to arthurs mother and his dad and how they met he leaves a pirate fatherson duo to die as they had been killing indiscriminately however this would later turn out to be a mistake as son wants revenge on meanwhile must go back to his kingdom of atlantis as his brother tries to start a war with those of us who reside on land arthur must try and reclaim his throne and prevent this war his brother so desperately wants and also deal with a new enemy the black mantaone of the reasons i enjoyed this one was the cast who did a very good job it was nice seeing dolph lundgren in a big movie for a change rather than the direct to dvd stuff he usually does these days jason momoa is really good as and is one of the main reasons i think this one worked as he is very charismatic as the hero in this one my favorite though was the black manta as they had the costume down pat he looked completely awesome and the fight between him and was the highlight of this movie for meso overall a very fun action movie and surprisingly so for me i think the dc films are rather good though i still favor the marvel film universe more i have always enjoyed marvel more in the comics too as i find their heroes more relatable and less overpowered than those of dc but i like the dc characters too i am looking forward to shazaam as well as that one looks fun too sorry but comic book films should be fun and not all dark and seriousunless we are talking spawn of course,fantasy
its a fun movie but keep in mind that its a comicbased movie s if you do not like super heroes do not go watch it simple like that,fantasy
casting was excellent patrick wilson in particular played a great role and of course jason momoa nobody on this planet could have been the legendary superhero like he was his acting was effortless great to see he enjoyed his guinness in the movie too i would highly recommend even non comic book fans to see it money well spent,fantasy
the movie has great fight choreography and pretty good cgi it was actionpacked and had a pretty interesting as well as exciting story the movie did a great job at showcasing atlantis and the world of you really want to know even more about atlantis and the deep after seeing this epic motionpicturedownsides the was very clich a couple of times and the props did sometimes look plasticy or unrealistic,fantasy
first things first  this movie is gorgeous aside from a few fleeting and forgivable moments the visuals in this movie are lovely objects feel like they have the scale and weight that they should which can be difficult to get right from a cgi perspective i found the movies humor hitormiss but mostly enjoyable some lines felt forced but meras first ventures onto land included numerous clever momentsdialogue was sadly predictable but generally delivered well amber heards performance was at times engaging and at times distracting she didnt seem particularly well suited for moments of powerful monologueas other reviewers have noted character development was rushed but they certainly made an effort to add a bit of depth to at least a couple characters i wanted to like black manta but came out disappointed maybe theyll do something more clever with him in the futurenumerous plot elements just sort of happened for no real reason other than to tie up the loose end of a joke left hanging from a setup ten minutes prior pinocchio for example the national treasure sequence on the quest for atlans trident seemed out of place within the scope of the rest of the movieoverall this is a great popcorn movie itll end up in my collection no doubt but likely wont merit another viewing until its sequel is released,fantasy
this is a visually stunning movie and the writing is amazing and the jokes were their but they didnt stay to long to make the jokes stupid but one thing i notice in the water scenes the characters look animated which i thought was strange but i understood why,fantasy
at the start of the movie somehow him being born by a human and a merperson and somehow he gets all the powers to control all the fish even though his brother was born by merpeople and didnt get to control all the fish then it went back to him as a kid training and then something happens with his trainer bringing up his mothers death and the you figure out she isnt really dead which is just a cheap twist my biggest gripe is brother was trying to get all the seas kingdoms together but 24 he just started killing people youd think youd need those people and then somehow controls the god and then just kills a bunch of people and then his mother tells them two to stop fighting which is the best scene in the movie so overall a decent movie if youre a superhero movie fan youll like it,fantasy
first review so here goes i am a fan of superhero movies so thought why not catch up with this one after not seeing it at christmas time all in all it passed the time and i left having enjoyed the film but i wont say its the best i have ever seen dc tends to be a bit of a darker side of this genre but this one felt a bit more lighter and fun back story is quickly sorted so you can watch as a stand alone movie and we find out it is set after justice league during general chit chatno real spoilers as our hero goes off on a quest to save the world and reluctantly claim his rightful thrown the plot as you would expect can be picked through but all of the stars in the movie have a bit of fun jason momoa is a bit wooden but he fills the role well there are plenty of good cgi moments and loads of bright colours whilst not to my taste and sometimes a waste of screen time i am sure the younger people will enjoy fight sequences get bigger and bigger as the movie goes on as goes on his travelsall in all a fun film certainly not the best but certainly not the worst shame no other dc characters didnt make a guest appearance but i guess being mostly under water kind of rules that out will i watch 2 yes probably worth a watch if you have nothing better to do,fantasy
a gloriously cheesy scifi epic which reminds me of a hammy 80s b flick  but with some unbelievable visuals and a pace that doesnt let up wan has built a world that needs to be seen to be believed  men riding alligators and sea horses arent even the most ridiculousawesome thing this film featurescheck your reality at the door and strap yourself in for the most far fetched film made in years,fantasy
an excellent skillful movie dont wait for this movie this year,fantasy
loved this epic hero journey had all the elements of a great classic even with some biblical references with judas and the 30 pieces of silver jason is an amazing,fantasy
lookthe bottom line is to be entertained and this film certainly doesdc always seems to be hits and missesthis film is defiantly one of their better attemptsso if your not a critic of every little aspect of visualdirectingetcthan sit back and be entertained for the sake of entertainment,fantasy
full disclosure the only other dceu film i have seen is suicide squad i am not emotionally invested in this franchise i went to see because it involves one of my favourite actordirector combos patrick wilson and james wan and the fact that jason momoa plays the lead didnt hurt wans horror films are elevated above the genre because of the character drama and i was hoping that would be the case with too the story is fairly predictable but thats forgivable and the characters do have some quirks outside the general tropes for this type of film maybe unrealistically i wanted a little less action and a few more quieter character driven moments patrick wilson was the standout for me a nuanced and captivating performance temuera morrison was great too the opening sequence telling tom and atlannas story was one of my favorite parts of the film the difficulty i had was getting on board with arthurs journey not because he wasnt likeable he was jason momoa does a fine job its the fact that arthurs motivation is weak and selfish at times and that i kind of agree with orm humanity is destroying the worlds oceans and should be held accountable for it i also found the final battle scene disturbing if im honest the way the sea creatures were used as weapons with no regard for the fact that they are living beings it didnt feel like the way a king or hero should treat them the visuals are undoubtedly spectacular the special effects are beautifully crafted and a pleasure to watch overall isnt the best film youll ever see but it certainly isnt the worst,fantasy
a fantastic movie made with great caprice and that will be a reference for others for many many years more than deserved,fantasy
this movie has many good reviews compared to better movies that get bad reviewsfirst of all why this movie isnt as bad as the other dceu moviesthis movie has great visuals and a good cut this movie is a difference to the really dark dc universe this is very refreshingthere are many actors who are very sympathetic and play well i found jason momoa and amber heard very likable and they had good chemistry between each other what i found sad was that willem dafoe did not have enough screentime or influence he could have had many meaningful influences on the plot but this was not realized but that is not so tragic because the film can convince by the sympathy of the characters i want to see more of each characterwhy that movie is not that goodthis movie copies many elements from other movies i know that most hollywood movies are copying but this movie is an embarrassing combination of elements for example the post credit scene is mimicking the post credit scene of black panther or for example the trident of the trident is imitating some other beings from other franchises i do not mind but it was painful to see how some of the movie elements were taken in a bad wayspeaking of black panther this film has many parallels to black panther due to the royal theme the difference why black panther is better than is simply that you experience many emotional scenes like important deaths at black panther black panther shows many parallels to royal dramas like those of shakespeare but has few scenes that really carry emotional weight i had expected a superhero movie with parallels to royal dramas and elements of love but was disappointed with a complete romance movie with cgii know that the comparisons with black panther are exaggerated but do you still know in what point black panther is better than the music the marvel movie had a soundtrack especially composed by kendrick lamar in collaboration with other artists while has songs that are not compatible with each other like two steps from hell  none shall live and a pitbull cover from toto  africa a female singer and can not make a uniform soundbut what you can notice is that the dialogue between the characters is really very stupid the producers should have allowed themselves time for production and had to revise the dialogue some statements from characters are sometimes exaggerated cheesy or ridiculous then you realize that they wanted to copy marvel but unfortunately failed because most jokes have failed with every joke no audience laughedtowards the end the film was so cheesy and so predictable that i was bored and expected the end of the film the film was usually very predictable especially at the end of the filmmaybe some people think im overdoing my criticism because its a dc movie but thats not true im a big fan of dc comics and i grew up with dc comics when i was a kid one of my favorite movies is the dark knight i watch every dc movie no matter how bad it may be im not saying that this movie is a disaster but for me it was very predictable and towards the end i was very bored i will wait and i would be happy about an 2 but hopefully it will be better implementedin summaryi think i would give this movie userdefined 67 points from 10 points there are plenty of better superhero movies but this movie is one of the best dc extended universe movies i found the movie more exciting than wonder woman but not so exciting if you judge him as a very ordinary movie he is average and nothing special,fantasy
i like the action scenes the dialogue was okay the only thing well two things i found problems with was the name arthur pulling the trident out of a stone and s sea mo stern that is eerily similar to the kraken and the fact that they called him king arthur at the end of the mo ie actually get a grip dc its a slippery slope i mean metahumans youve plagiarized every other fable why not just call the characters mutants,fantasy
finally it seems that that dceu has worked out how to do superhero films right instead of the dull dingy worlds of films like batman vs superman or suicide squad provides a sequence of visually stunning settings with colour palettes that help to set the scene gone is the failed attempts to make the series dark and gritty instead heres a film that accepts that the audience of a modern superhero film is there for an exciting and lighthearted action film then proceeds to hit the mark it even subtly acknowledges the common criticism of the dceu that theyre just copying marvel with a couple of visual jokes if this is what dc films are going to be from now on then i look forward to what comes next,fantasy
 is a movie you should best watch in packed houses then you can really enjoy all the fun of the movie yes as the critics have pointed out this is a cgi fest but that is a great plus for the moviethe plot of the movie is simple the real essence of the movie lies in its wonderful visuals as you would know the movie is set in the underwater kingdom of atlantis the makers have excelled at making atlantis as beautiful as possiblecoming to the acting william dafoe and patrick wilson were outstanding but the biggest praise goes to jason momoa ohhow cool he was i have become his fan now amber heard was a constant source of irritation with her skinfit and cleavagebarring outfits but nicole kidman was the one who disappointed me i was hoping a good performance from her but all i got was her walking around in skimpy costumesoverall was a hell of a fun ride go for it,fantasy
come on dc please stop messing with my childhood memories 1st it was the flashs suit in justice league and now jason momoa with the long hair and scraggly beard as as far as the movie itself went i really enjoyed it and i get you need some star power to sell a movie of this nature  but to us super hero purists it was patrick orm who looked more like there are a lot of us dc and marvel fans who pay attention to these things and wish that directors would too,fantasy
it had everythinghumour action gorgeous landscapes great lines,fantasy
i iove it and it was nice to see movie like that s,fantasy
so another dc movie which have succeded to save dcs cinematic universe now we can say that aside with wonnder woman is also holding the dc universe to collapse after justice league,fantasy
wow is such a phenomenal film great effects great main protagonist great female protagonist amazing action sequencesits got a few flaws like overthetop acting from some villains but so what theyre villains which therefore justifies their outlandishness really makes you get behind the hero its probably because you know hes not backing down hes incredibly tough and strong plus jason momoa has quite the charisma i think this is what a superhero should be like he or she will get beat up but you can bet your ass they are going to even the score and that they arent backing down too many times in superhero movies we see the superhero getting defeated to give out this notion that comic book films are showing a dimension of reality however the comic book film is supposed to an escapist film why would you go to a superhero movie and be sad depressed or angry that should not be the case were supposed to be inspired by the hero and feel uplifted after watching the film yes im taking a jab at infinity war and batman v superman and even the dark knight fight mesuperheroes need to be more like this i wouldnt mind some dark element but come on good must trump evil in films like these i thank everyone who was behind the story of this marvellous film for bringing back the superhero film i hope to see more of these in the future to come,fantasy
before i saw the movie in cinema i thought its a boring one but when i got out of the cinema i cannot say anything but wooooowgreat movie sequencegreat graphicsthere are all movie elements you never see them in one movie good evil love history imagination high techetc but most important is the end i admire the end its happy end and no one is missedgreat movie and i prefer to see it in cinematic way to live it,fantasy
a wonderfully pur together complex dc story well done,fantasy
its amazing and most awesome actions movie ever i also enjoyed watching some one from iowa being the star,fantasy
let me start by saying i loved wonder women when it came out and that it definitely breathed live back into dc universe films after the releases of justice league and batman v superman has done the samejason mamoa and amber heard are captivating leads and have great chemistry on screen in my opinion the story was engaging and didnt feel forced or dragged out like it can in some movies the action scenes were fantastic they were let me grab my popcorn entertainingthe only part of the movie i thought was so so was one villian black manta his character just wasnt that interesting and a bit cheesy other than that i loved the filmoverall this is a film dc fans deserved instead of some of the past that have just flopped i cant wait to see what they do with the sequel,fantasy
it reminds me to thor but the protagonist has a clear personality the environment is variated and well made and characters show more emotionsa scene literally has a brutal fall of fps probably will be fixed at the bluray but i saw it on the cinema and my ribs hurted when i saw itdont worry it still have a martha moment,fantasy
wasnt too sure on this film at first waited a while before going to the big screen to see it but glad i did a very very good film alot of cgi which takes a while to get used to but the story and way this movie is finished is excellent tempted to go see it again now,fantasy
i think is the best dc movie i ve seen recentlyi just saw it now in 3dx best movie experience i ever hadloved evreything about the movie ,fantasy
first wonder woman and nowdc is going to hit the marketawesome movie,fantasy
from warner bros pictures and director james wan comes an actionpacked adventure that spans the vast visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas starring jason momoa in the title role the film reveals the origin story of halfhuman halfatlantean arthur curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetimeone that will not only force him to face who he really is but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be a king swims with its entertainingly ludicrous tide offering up cgi superhero spectacle that delivers energetic action with an emphasis on good oldfashioned fun,fantasy
well firstly jason has been a great actor since he appeared as khal drogo in got and he did a wonderful role in for his sense of humor and the ability to change the dark scene or the fight scene into something that we can laugh in order to make the movie funnierwell done jason momoa ,fantasy
finally dc is stepping up their game  jason momoa is the best  love all the actorsactresses and the visual effects im pretty impressed  well done james wan for another awesome movie ,fantasy
deserves more than a 10 really graphics are on a another level visually breathtaking the cast played really well especially mamoa i mean its jason mamoa how can he dissapoint his audience its full actionpacked movie with great storyline its a must watch watched it 3 times in theatre it was worth it,fantasy
amazing visuals great character development and world building funny chemistry between actors had me leaving theater excited for sequel,fantasy
this is a great adaptation of funny and action packed at the same time,fantasy
awesome effects and cinematography great ost entertaining inspiring good actors performance it is really equilibrate and all that makes it a really good movie,fantasy
amazing all around i loved this epic film this film really does take us on an adventure around this beautiful underwater world james wan directs this beautifully and brings this world alive the casting was perfect in my opinion everyone involved brought this world alive and truly delivered this film came after the backlash of the justice leagues failure to deliver to a lot of the fans and filmgoers alike which was never going to be an easy task but they did it and did it with stylei was doubting this film walking into the cinema although i personally loved the man of steel and batman vs superman but when i watched it made me think this is what the justice league couldve been the cinematography was stunning and it really does pull you into the world the cgi used was brilliant and captivating and really does give a feel that this world could be real amber heards best performance to date and the chemistry between her and jason mamoa seems natural and not forced but i also loved the connection between mamoa and defoeif the dceu follow suit then i cant see why they cant get back on track with the world that theyve been trying to create in no way was this film rushed its pacing was perfect i really cant pick fault with this film its exactly what as a lifetime comic fan i wanted i feel jason mamoa really felt this character and embraced the role in every way cant wait to see more of this in the futureloved it,fantasy
best movie everthe sound was amazing and cgi perfectso happy of this movie,fantasy
this movie was awesome the story line is strong and the way this movie is picturize is mind blowing and in imax this movie was superb this deserve to be see in imax the guys who hadnt watched this movie i recommend people to watch this movie it will make you fan rather you are dc or marvel fan you will truly love it,fantasy
ive been disappointed in a lot of the dc films this one is definitely the best one so far,fantasy
 was fantastic plenty of action and impressive visuals that i would even say is the best dc movie to date i hope dc keeps this trend and not let politics influence their future films,fantasy
an excellent movie excellent cinematography a salute to james wan if anyone says that is not a good movie then heshe is a dc haters and not going to watch in theatres to enjoy its vfx on big screen and waiting for dvd to be release then heshe is a fool,fantasy
magical a must watch cant wait for the next one ,fantasy
the best dc movie so far although thats not saying much considering their output so far has been mediocre having said that jason mamoa was born to play and has more charisma in his finger than chadwick boseman black panther has in his entire bodya good balance of story and action and the underwater scenes are nothing short of spectacular the visual effects guys who walked on this movie should be commended for the stellar work they did black manta was an awesome villain and his suit was faithful to the comicsif i had one minor gripe it would be the romance between arthur and mera i have never been a fan of romance in my comic book movies as i feel it takes you out of the flow and that kissing scene while explosions go off in the distance was cringe inducingso a success for dc so lets hope they can keep the ball rolling with shazam shall we,fantasy
this is a movie that raises my hopes that dc will make good movies againthe film has great successes as for example the cgi is pleasant to see and very colorful the fight scenes are very incredible and it becomes very interestingbut it has a bad point it is that it is overloaded with history i think that the plot with black manta could have been saved for another movie many people say that the film is predictable and the truth is that it is true but honestly i did not care because the entertainment made me forget that pointin conclusion i recommend that you go see unless you usually get bored easily,fantasy
i wanted to see this because of the special effects this movie was awesome the cast were perfect story line amazing i cannot wait to see it again well done,fantasy
i really like this film because the message is so powerful its about training to be the best you can be then when you are ready your task is to beat anything thats in your way with a humble heart because good always wins another reason why i like it is because of the action between arthur and king orm these two teach that no matter what the situation is violence is never the answer i also really like the background music because the suspense really moved me and made me want to jump out of my seat with excitement and joythis amazing actionadventure film is about the city of atlantis which is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the powerhungry king orm with his army by his side king orm plans to take over the remaining oceanic people to become the king of all oceans better known as the oceanic master then to rule the surface world standing in orms way is his halfhuman halfatlantean brother known as halfbreed with help from vulko who is the royal counselor of the throne must retrieve the powerful trident of atlan to proclaim the title as the protector of the deep blue seathe cast includes arthur jason momoa game of thrones atlanna nicole kidman dead calm king atlan graham mctavish outlander mera amber heard never back down king orm patrick wilson insidious vulko willem dafoe spiderman manta yahya abdulmanteen ii the greatest showmanmy favorite part of this film is when arthur finds out that he has the power to talk to the creatures in the water in other words echolocation following that arthur doesnt know how to control the power that he has which is why king atlan puts arthur in the hands of the royal counselor vulko to learn to control his powers from the training that artur does with vulko arthur shall use it in the futureaside from that king orm plans to take things into his own hands and decides to conquer the seven seas to become king of the deep blue sea also known as the oceanic master after that king orm plans to take apart the surface world to become his treasure for goodi give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18 as well as adults truly the whole family will love this film as it has so many funny and good reaction moments this film also requires very good anthropomorphic qualities in various scenes dont miss this amazing actionadventure film directed by james wan which is playing in theaters now to find out what happens at the endreviewed by siaki s kids first film critic for more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org,fantasy
i got a few jump scares because the volume in the chinema was so loud and this was the best dc has given out,fantasy
i absolutely loved it  everything about this movie is amazing  everyone applauded at the end  i was so happy d i truly recommend it ,fantasy
i thought critics were harsh on iti thought jason momoa was perfect asi thought the script was excellent by james wan and his direction was perfect,fantasy
this was in imax with 3d on the first week and i have watched on the first day this movie is released one week prior worldwide before it got released in usa it got top rating from reviews from indiathis is great experience watching this kind of well made movie director knows how not to relax the audience when one action sequence ends and the next one starts immediately the screenplay is goodworth watching this film in big screen,fantasy
so great loved it a little cheesy but it a good magical way,fantasy
i think this movie is getting much better reviews than it deserves why well when a bunch of movies in the dc world do horribly and then one ends up being ok its made out to be some shining lightreview star wars underwater poor dialogue and mediocre acting with an allstar main actor that wasnt given any good moments or funny jokes but filled with some pretty awesome action and graphics,fantasy
dc has been panned by critics because of their dark and gritty storylines but thats what sets it apart from marvelmos and bvs were great ww began the slide jl took it and ran and fully adopted the marvel method just another colourful pop corn flick without any substance or drama corny jokes and generic plotim afraid whats coming next will be just more of the same maybe a batman fighting crime in the day timeboring,fantasy
im a fan of marvel movies in general but this was kind of a mess only passably enjoyable as a popcorn flick momoa seems to be having fun but i was mostly left dazzled by the colors and cgi and not really engaging with the story spoiler when finally obtains his macguffin trident what does he do he rides a leviathan creature into battle resolving the central conflict in two minues deusexmachina amid more trippy undersea star wars cgi effects meh,fantasy
this is by far not a bad movie not at all jason mamoa is one again great as arthur curry or aqua man and is joined by a star studded cast with actors such as willem dafoe nicole kidman amber heard and patrick wilson where this movie excels is in definitely int he action scenes from the beginning to the end i was continuously amazed by these really well shot and choreographed action scenes and really added to my enjoyment of the movie this movie is also visually stunning especially when we first see atlantis for the first time where this movie does struggle is that their is just way too much going on in the movie which overall leads to a messy story with no real cohesion  in addition the script at times is not the best as some lines are too cringe overall this movie is very entertaining but has its flaws but the dc seem one step into the right direction with these movies,fantasy
dc seem to be going down a similar route with each film for me and this was no different is very crash bang action and is good in parts but is far too long there has been a lot of cgi finales in previous dc films and does the same admittedly atlantis needed to be heavy cgi the big plus in this film for me was jason momoa charming and very likeable definitely embodies the roll if you enjoyed justice league this is as good but its no man of steel,fantasy
if i would own a personal theatre it would be just for this movie it has everything best actor choices a lot of action good way of showing the life of arthur and i have never heard a soundtrack like this i could say a lot more things but i just want to say if you havent seen it what are you waiting for and please rate it 1010 it realy is one of the best movies its the best dc movie,fantasy
one of the best superhero movies yet definitely see,fantasy
 is another exchangeable superhero movie but its so dynamic and visually stunning that you wont care about the insultingly predictable plot and the repetitive superhero tropesthe movie has a short and appropriate introduction before the epic adventure unfolds and ends on a concise positive note going back to its opening sequence the underwater world looks fantastic and especially the animals like sharks are lovely the quest that leads the main character and his female sidekick across the planet includes stunning locations like sicily and morocco that offer a welcome change from the seas the settings are carefully chosen and cleverly mixed with computer animations director james wan filmed everything calmly extravagantly and precisely even the dramatic action scenes like the breathtaking escape sequence in sicily avoid shaky cameras and exaggerated special effects which makes the film enjoyable to watch from start to finish the final duel between the courageous halfbreed protagonist and his sinister halfbrother is visually spectacular and emotionally engagingyou will get exactly what you expect from this movie shallow but gripping entertainment for the whole family with a big budget its pleasant while it lasts but also quickly forgotten because of predictable tropes an overall tiresome story and mostly average acting performances up next lets create another exchangeable superhero movie called airwoman earthtransgender or firetiger,fantasy
 is so cool wen is a great directorbest dc movie ever,fantasy
want to watch a second time but is blocked by the distance to the nearest cinema,fantasy
im longtime imdb member but this is really my first review james wan really did amazing job with this movie and he deserved more appreciation from criticsthe story was well crafted the cgi was beautifully rendered the set design was magici think james wan is revolutionary filmmakers and he is master of modern cinematography cant wait what he will do next,fantasy
the heading says it all  this movie was pretty good provided you can stand to watch a scruffy superhero whos too lazy to shave with a couple of exceptions very nearly all of the men in the movie are super cleancut and wholesomeeven the bad guysthe cgi of which there was a superabundance is good the realization of atlantis is very good and the colors are wow the story line drags and times and the quest theres always a quest in a fantasy film takes most of the first two hours of the movie still it was worth a look,fantasy
 is my best movie in 2018 after avengers infinity warvfx was soo goodlast action scane impressed me ,fantasy
better than i thought didnt know how they were gana maneuver the bad colored tights and uniforms in the comics but the seahorses and riding sharks was wack mean seahorses scary seahorses but other than that surprisingly good except amber hurd no one should hire shes been blackmailing johnny depp trying to ruin him for money get her out the paint shes a c scarlet jo anyway get her outa here she would ride away on an orca wale blackfish style,fantasy
nice movietesttttttttttttttttrecomendations,fantasy
the movie is amazingone of the beat dc movies i ever watched  the story and the actors are amazing,fantasy
really fun watch beautiful visionary a little corny at times and not all jokes land but it is a very entertaining movie and i had a blast it really takes the sillyness of and owns it it is aware of what kind of movie it is great action scenes and a real treat to the eye with a beautiful blend of colors and some awesome cgi,fantasy
so this flick is basically about yet another superhero about one with aqua powers like harnessing aquatic animals to do thy bidding as im in this theater on a seat my face occasionally hovers over to the audience with a quick glance and im just freaking wondering hows everyone else because these people are great to view in the solace of a movie theater but you recall people can be totally not grating when dealing with them or they can be your wildest dreams in fun i am in solace but i want to be in the company of people more and intake that social tranquility to enjoy the rude hilarity of a social banquet nose in books and an iron butt of studying begone the world runs on earthly delightsi do know a level of knowledge of these mythos except this character the flick is like about a kingdom of atlanteans and the title hero is half human half atlantean and the plot is how he must take the atlantean throne to be king because his naughty relation is on the throne the very first entrance of this superhero must totally be something awesome and his entrance indeed shows him in action theres a good group of supporting cast here probably chosen because of their unusual aqualine features like willem defoe and dolph lundgren  together in a movie at long last willem is as you know the green goblin in that first spiderman also a nonstop classic filmography and dolph is the original punisher and nicole kidman is here too dr chase from batman forever therrrrre used to be a graying tower alone by the sea yoouuuuuu remain the light of the darkness in meeeeeee but did you know that when it snows the eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen bapbap badadaaaa that movie theres something goofy but something fantastical dolph is the original punisher and that movie hes in is essentially one of the first superhero flicks showing off the skull vigilante of the streets you reader if you have any troubles the streets will answer your call with a masters of fist from university of scrapdown mr p happy hunting as said to him in that movie so having dolph in here is earnedyou know theres some melodramatic parts in here and i would personally just keep those on the lowdown but they all have their audience i suppose its like that looney tunes cartoon where bugs and daffy are operatically singing and theres this chubby horse im not too into that but appreciate the melodrama just iconographically as like oh here it has to be like that apart from the usual cartoonyness the current james bonds gotta be less soap operish as some neoreaction to the before bond movies which were these dumb gadgetshootfests that layered stuff is dull just opt for the dumb in this movie those type of parts are just brief but hey i rationalize this as like the symbol of drama a frowning mask and a smiling mask virtually the entire movie takes place in lots of aquatic kingdoms and the one land place they visit issicily and sahara desert so there you go sicily you have now become the face of aquasuperheroes better than all those sicilian mob stuff the first hovering helicopter shot showing this city has the classic tiledroof and adobe houses and as they said in the movie the godfather during michaels sicilian hiding that here women are more dangerous than guns the very first shot of the populous shows a kid chatting with a girl sitting around some fountain ledge there you go maybe study or read superhero comics holy smokes eh never mind just go for it the battle of sicily is shown with battling some super villains to further fair the image of this place they show off some ancient statues of the greats scipio africanusgood strategist who went against even greater hannibal romulus little caesar and pizzakiddingprobably the best parts were basically these equilibrium moments of trying to evade all these aquabeasts later on because theyre part of some different kingdoms and by this time in the movie youre just glad to have lots of stuff flying around after the plot was really effortfully setup and theyre chasing and chasing now its ok to just lay back dumbsmack in video game style stuff flying aroundmaybe show eating some popcorn shrimp with tartar or cocktail sauce and some fries with freaking root beer or dr pepper i eat costco pizza and hotdog prior to this somewhere in the middle of this the movie gets good in that equilibrium mode when the bad guy is standing around looking bored like what else can i do around here and just goes arrest him to another guy in that throne room,fantasy
nice visual boring storyline nothing much to write,fantasy
feels sad when i saw the rating less than 8actually this movie deserve 9but i gave 10 to balance the overall scoremy rating may not be effective since there are many negative viewersas a fan of super hero  i did my bestthe plot is known to everyone also most of the best parts of the movie is already shown in the 4 min trailer but it is still entertainingnot like mcu trailers they gave less info and even confused senses to draw attention from peoplecgi is fantastic  senses of atlantic city did do its part to support the moviei think atlantic should not be shown in the trailer because it feels down for the cinematic fansfinallyit was a enjoyable super hero movie to watch,fantasy

one of the most beautiful and visually rich movies ive ever seen designers carried the show in almost every way then there was black mantis who looked like he fell out of 1960s star trek character felt likeable honest admirable mera although not embodied with the best acting wasnt a nuisance and became rather endearing by the end whenever i began to doubt her casting choice my eyes would wander and id quickly come to my senses there were some pacing issues at the beginning with how much emotion they tried to cram into the backstory but the pace pretty much sorts itself out by the end never did i find myself bored in fact there were probably a dozen scenes that had me absolutely enraptured in the end i found myself inspired by beauty a decent hero architype and i would be happy to watch it again,fantasy
 is full of cliches and deus exmaquina things only happen because the script wanted too the story feels forced toobut the acting is good for the most part momoa evolved and knows how to create an interesting character and amber could be better daffoe and patrick could apear more and black mantha to the action and direction are wonderfull and the cgi is perfect and really of qualityin an oversaturated genre because of the effects and solid story is a fresh air unfortunately same cant be said about the script as with a sequel underwater wont be anymore something new if continues like that it will be kinda bad,fantasy
its easy to give this movie 1010 if you compare it solely to its dc movie peers but thats not a very high barits fun the visuals are incredible but the humour is very obvious and therefore unfunny the love interest and the oh my did we just hold hands moments are worthy of some monstrous eyerolls and if im honest there is just too many superhero pose moments that it almost becomes irritating oh and the black manta looks like hes out of the power rangers and im sorry but if the villain has to say you can call me black manta then they really need a kick up the backside and theres an ateam esque moment in there that makes you want to beat yourself to death with your own eyesdespite all of these negatives its an enjoyable movie no its not the best dc movie ever made as much as i wanted it to be but its a fun movie the atlantis scenes are beautifully visualised and the action is very well done but the brazen attempts to copy the humour of thor ragnarok and combine it with the upbeat music driven abandon of guardians of the galaxy just doesnt quite hit the mark its too cheesy too obvious and its been done better elsewhere if it cant decide if it wants to be serious or light hearted then how is the audience supposed to decide i came out having enjoyed a visual feast that had just a little too much ham and cheese,fantasy
the good thing about this movie is that you you sit there and 2 12 hours you wont get bored it is action packed almost every minif you see to the movie dont question about the logic of course whatever under the sea is like a fantasy world it totally does not link the surface world that is not what you see this movie you want to see the action and story with actionthere are two cons about this move1 the black actor whos father got killed by seeked revenged but his result was not really plotted so well he just got thrown off the cliff not even opening up the mask not dramatic enough2 too messy at the end too many cgi the civil war scenes under the sea were too much in some wayoverall it is not a bad movie and you found some funny moments there too,fantasy

yup this is a spoiler review sorry guysfor those of you who have read some of my previous reviews youd know that i really hate the dceu sure wonder woman was fine and all but all of the other films ranged from pretty bad man of steel to absolutely unbearable batman v superman enter a film that actually managed to be the very first good dceu film and the reason why is because its trying to be its own thingwhats the story once home to the most advanced civilization on earth the city of atlantis is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the powerhungry king orm with a vast army at his disposal orm plans to conquer the remaining oceanic people  and then the surface world standing in his way is orms halfhuman halfatlantean brother and true heir to the throne with help from royal counselor vulko must retrieve the legendary trident of atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deepthe best thing that this film has to offer is the visuals the underwater cinematography the designs of atlantis the creative and energetic action sequences and of course the water effects are extremely innovative and breathtaking to look at its a huge step up from the visual effects in justice league and it manages to blow zack snyders visuals for dc movies to the water no pun intended another thing that works very well is the heart of the film believe it or not there is actually a lot of very good and well thoughtout emotion way more than youd expect from an movie there were scenes where i was almost gonna cry its hard to make me cry when im watching a movie so thats an impressive move that this movie pulled off for example when arthurs dad says that he still waits for her to come back on the dock by his beach house and when it actually happens the tears start to fall on the floor if i were to criticize something its that we dont get a very good introduction on mera its like arthurs dad is about to die in one scene and all of a sudden surprise mera shows up she ends up healing arthurs dad so its not like he dies or anything also the story not only takes elements from mcu films like thor and black panther but later on in the film it just becomes this generic fetch quest where arthur has to retrieve a trident to become king of atlantis and of course once he retrieves it it becomes like every other film where everything goes into slow motion theres gregorian chanting and as a bonus arthur and mera end up loving each other the ending of the film is a bit generic but its still a nice ending and the rest of the film plays on wellin conclusion is not just a really good movie with spectacular visual effects and many heartwarming moments but it also got me into dc i know theres two kinds of people who either love marvel and hate dc or hate marvel and love dc but im gonna be an exception for this because now i love both i hope dc continues to make some really great films in the future because proves that even dc can wield a golden trident,fantasy
most beautifully visualized superhero foeverwe just came out of the theatre and i can honestly say i liked iti dont know whats going on with all the negative reviews people are really hard to please i went to see that movie without any real expectations and i thoroughly enjoyed it i really want james wan to direct more dceu movies in futurebest action scenes atmospherechoreographycinematographyvisualsdirectingvillians,fantasy
i didnt hold up much hope when going to see due to previous dc find being less than good wonder woman semiexcluded but i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed from its brutal and well choreographed fight scenes to the goosebump inducing hero moments this is a fun funny and hugely entertaining film,fantasy
i watched it with not a lot of expectations but it surprised me i didnt really like previous dc movies much but this one was very different,fantasy
the cgi was damn awesome graphics especially in the fight scenes where it is really amazing  the story line had a nice flow but lacked suspense due to the predictable scenes and dialogue speaking of dialogue aweful half of the conversations that were in the movie were there because they had to be rather than augmenting character relationships as they should have rather than practically undermining momoas character and even his acting in the scenes where he was speaking not to mention the fact that 90 of the movie was drawn out fight scenes that happened so fast you couldnt figure out who the good guys or the bad guys were mixed with unrealistic scenarios with fire underwater and watching 2 people with the ability to swim fast underwater use a boat to get across the ocean i mean really use a flare underwater to navigate through the ocean the love story could of been built up better and the protagonist and main character the whole movie was about didnt have anything to overcome the movie starts with having superpowers and being this big hero and ends in the same way he doesnt find himself in anyway and practically walks into a room for 5 minutes picks up a fork and becomes the king of the ocean or whateverhonestly the only reason i give this movie a rating of 610 is the amazing cgi incorporation of music and the general storyline but really whoever was in charge of characters needs to check themselves,fantasy

went with the kids and we all loved it good harmless fun,fantasy
best dc movie i have ever seen no false note except for casting nicole kidman for queen atlanavisuals and sound effects were pretty good story is moving in the right direction throughout the movie except for some clichesthe fighting scenes were goofy however they were better than other dcsrecommended and worth the two hours you gonna spend watching it,fantasy
this movie had it allaction dialogue story 2 great villains love betrayal friendship cgi soundtrack actorsdc finally did it right,fantasy
long story short im a coastal boy from maine and this is the best superhero movie i have ever seen it has the perfect amount of everything a emotional roller coaster from the word go jason mamoa is the,fantasy
if you keep an open mind towards this movie youll find it better than any other superhero movie vfx is amazing and very well executed acting by jason and amber is very realistic and entertaining must watch,fantasy
these movies just keep getting better and better and betterhands down one of my favorite movies of a great heroic characteri cannot wait to own this on dvd,fantasy
 was every bit as entertaining and amazing to watch as each of the recent spate of marvel blockbusters realeased by disney if not even more sothe visuals special effects graphic cgi casting and everything else was off the chain ill likely watch this one more times than ive watched wonder woman im so ready for an equally amazing release of the green latern,fantasy
from dc universe thanks warner is magnficent,fantasy
the arthurian legends play prominently in as do the mythologies of zeus hades poseidon and perseus not only is a mythological sword released in but a variety of crackins aka liam neesom style the movie could have buckled under the weight of trying to be all things to all fictions but instead was all the better for it add to that a decent storyline solid acting incredible special effects and a few important messages from the ecologysee but see it on the big screen,fantasy
nice movie a lot of hidden messages its not a perfect because sometimes they lose their train with the love story they want to talk about,fantasy
possible spoilersi enjoyed this film immensely much more whimsical not unlike marvels black panther than previous dc entries the story was very much the heros journeyquest with really intense battles saved for act 3 although pollution of the oceans was admonished it was not overly preached to get in the way of the story james wans direction managed to bring arthur curry to vivid reality and jason momoa was delightful in the part with a good backstory it explains his modern colloquial speech in justice league perfectly happy to see willem defoe as a goodguy and amber heard was a thoughtful and dryly funny mera patrick wilson brought his agame as the covillain with an intense turn by yahya abdulmateen ii as the bookend villain manta the villains carried dimension and were not just cookiecutter beautiful filming and well executed cgi along with many bows to the comic and the saturday morning cartoon super friends as far as the actualization of went i would give the film a solid b to a hope to see more adventures with arthur,fantasy
it has been said that someone does not undertand the high scores well this is the magic of the cinema that has a different impact on different people anyway the results and stats are clear when you count the regular people that sits on the cinema,fantasy
this has been by far the best dc comic movie ive seen secondly only to wonder woman the story was good the acting good and the graphics were done very well very good movie,fantasy
its a good movie but im my opinion the characters arent even close to marvel heros depth with story,fantasy
i finally got round to seeing this movie today and it was absolutely amazing especially in 4d even though i defended justice league last year looking back it was not as good as this masterpieceheck this is possibly even better then anything except for infinity wars of course that came out of the mcu the past year or so i admit i was not a massive fan of black panther nor i enjoyed antman and the wasp that muchafter the success of wonder woman 2017 and somewhat man of steel i am glad they are looking back at their products on how to make their movies better even if a small number of comic book nerds or marvelmcu troll would not agreeon to the actual movie it self it did a good job focusing the story more on despite small changes but it still did a good job portraying it even if you are not familiar withthe script and the dialogues were pretty good acting wise it was good without having any over acting or getting too pretend as their roles the casing of jason mamoa patrick wilson amber heard william defoe temura morrison and nicole kiddman was a very well done aswellthe cgi was really good for each scene both in and out of the water as well as the special effectsoverall this was an amazing movie and possibly my favourite i have seen this year,fantasy
astonishing film pure magic beautiful special effects formidable cinematography epic action scenes the story is very interesting smooth and pleseant not slow the locations are breathtaking there is a touch of irony that gives a soft touch to the running time so superb movie thumbs up,fantasy
im a marvel fan but decided to try this out as my first dc comic product it didnt disappoint although it lacked the humour found in marvel moviescontent was top notch cgi almost perfect and sound effect was cool,fantasy
wellwritten exciting good acting and fantastic animated environments,fantasy
wow again i got it wrong with another superhero movie that was trending and got good reviewsim tired of the same two sides story that works for our bipolar brains bad vs good especially when the movie is 2h20min long seriouslyspoiler alert the good wins at the endvisually it is quite impressive even though im struggling to validate the concept of humans swimming and speaking under water i didnt find the acting very convincing nor the script actionfight scenes are really good thoim gonna pause superhero movie for a solid year i think you should do to,fantasy
must watch movie one of the best superhero movies,fantasy
so good definitely recommend seeing best dc movie by far,fantasy
very beautiful movie great plot amazing actors and the cgi effects are on the next level must watch,fantasy
my new favorite movie i loved how they covered all aspects of the characters life its indiana jones superman rocky with bill  teds excellent adventure and black panther sprinkled on top great film,fantasy
dont listen to the crappy reviewsgo watch this movie its great,fantasy
the movie its fun to watch great cast and awesome effects,fantasy
the story was good but very predictable the characters were a bit flat and told cringe lines to make the film funnier the choreography of the fight scenes is great the visuals are amazing in most of the shots but have some weird physics under the waterin conclusion im really recommend this film to watch i saw it in dolby atmos but i think the best experience is in imax they shot some of the scenes in 70mm,fantasy
the movie felt like it was an adventure it was a journey of a man from two worlds whos caught in a war he never wanted to be a part of  the writing was good comedy scenes were good there was few cringy scenes but overall the character development was good and theyve set the base for future movies jason and amber were fantastic their whole chemistry really made the movie watchableoverall its a good movie,fantasy
take a bow james wanbest dc film so farimax 3d version is preferred for viewers ,fantasy
had no hopes from this movie when the trailers came out went to imax last night because of the reviews this movie has been getting and i am so happy i did visually this movie is one of the best dc movies i have ever seen the action scene are so hard hitting that you start feeling bad for the characters the action sequence with manta and then with the treachers is one of the best i have seen this year3d is done very well so it does not feel unnecessary the story is not something that will blow your heads off and i was not expecting anything unusual as welloverall a great watch if you plan to take kids be careful  there are some jump off the seat moments,fantasy
just came back from watching and really enjoyed it especially the first two acts the storyline itself doesnt break any new ground weve all heard a similar tale before but the payoff is worth it due to some very likeable main charactersas far as dc movies go i do actually prefer wonderwoman but is streets ahead of the other recent dc movies to be clear i didnt mind man of steel but this was a new and overall more entertaining filmhopefully this combined with wonderwoman is enough to keep the dc universe going as im sure there still some good stories that can be told,fantasy
 is the latest installment in dcs cinematic universe their sets of films have generally left me personally with mixed reactions i enjoyed wonder womans refreshingly emotional narrative and justice leagues lighthearted chemistry between the main cast films like batman v superman and suicide squad however suffered strongly from overly convoluted stories and unlikable characters luckily succeeds with the adventure formula presenting a exciting fun and action packed narrative headed with a charismatic lead actor when a lighthouse keeper temuera morrison shares a romance with the queen of atlantis nicole kidman results in the birth of a half blood son arthur jason momoa the queen is forced to return to atlantis where she is sacrificed for her treachery this fuels the hate within arthurs half brother orm patrick wilson to wage war with the surface world in order to protect humanity arthur is trained and helped by vulko willem dafoe and mera amber heard to go on a deadly mission to dethrone orm a story that has been seen a zillion times in superhero movies i feel but what makes so much fun is its fast paced energy charismatic performances production design and action scenes jason momoa really puts his stamp on the character of arthur curry a drifter who has no will or ambition to become the king he shares great father  son chemistry with morrison where the audience really buys their loving relationship unfortunately the character becomes less significant as the story gets going kidman for her limited amount of screen time shows off prowess strength and beauty patrick wilson is a competent villain certainly the best in the entire dceu there was potential at the start to make him more than a two dimensional bad guy unlike killmonger this arc feels unfinished and the villain loses the initial interest however unlike steppenwolf ares zod and especially lex luthor there was a actually a sense of threat that functioned about wilson his ambition and blood thirst makes him effective but nothing special he is a standard mcu villain willem dafoe also has great chemistry with momoa as this mentor figure and it was certainly nice to see dafoe in a superhero film again however there also were some let downs in the acting department amber heard is wooden and shares no chemistry with momoa i fully understand why wan decided to cast dolph lundgren in this movie but he unfortunately is an incredibly stiff actor that doesnt even possess this guilty pleasure 1980s charisma something that arnold schwarzenegger chuck norris or christopher lambert perfected some of the cgi effects still look unconvincing especially a deaging effect used on a certain actor the story is contrived and thin and is only supposed to lead from one action scene to the next from one exotic and interesting location to another and as this succeeds fans of adventure serials and lighthearted superhero movies look no further for those who look for something with more depth no pun intended should perhaps stay away this is not comparable with the dark knight the winter soldier logan or infinity war but for fans of brendan frasers the mummy will feel right at home,fantasy
when i first heard about this movie coming out i was very skeptical especially since this was following the train wreck justice league i am not fully against dc movies  although i prefer marvel because dc does have really good ones batman wonder woman and now the cast was very good jason momoa did a fantastic job he fit the part really well and he is not hard to look at which is a win for dc the casting of evil brother however could have been better than patrick wilson his usual type of movies  insidious and theconjuring are very different from his part he played in his acting was not bad at all i just had a hard time seeing him fit the part overall this movie was very fascinating to see with all of the underwater special effects since it is something i have yet to see in movies before great color great action i would say it is worth it to go see while it is still in theaters just because your television at home just cant quite capture the action and special effects that a movie theater can is this movie perfect no but really no movie is but i would recommend you seeing this movie as it was an enjoyable fun experience,fantasy
this was equal to wonder woman the movie about i always hoped for,fantasy
i watched this movie 4d and i guess it was the best decision about this movie i made also with 3d glasses you will enjoy beautiful underwater view also action scenes are taking you inside the movie with 4d you are becoming a part of moviebut scenario is cliche thats why go to this movie for enjoying action and visualization,fantasy
it occurred to me more than once as i watched this movie that is basically dcs answer to thor now i know full well that was created in response to marvel  then timely comics namor but this the big strong kinda dumb hunk with the beard the magical weapon and the goofball sense of humor hes dcs thor and this movie this equally goofy fast paced action driven blockbuster about a heroic fish out of water character pun intended fighting his brother for the throne it feels a lot like the thor franchise for better and for worselike ragnark this whole production is so cheerfully goofy for instance when first faces his brother in a gladiatorial arena in front of cheering crowds theres a holographic display of the fighters stats just like on espn later actually suggests peeing on something to properly hydrate it yes its that kind of movie so naturally the plot such as it is is completely predictable and exists mainly to string together the fight scenes and comic relief sequencesand these are very good i especially enjoyed the showdown with black manta that featured so heavily in the trailers while the submarine fight in which they first meet made for a refreshingly serious change of pace the gladiator fight is a lot of fun and the massive final battle with multiple undersea fleets shooting it out even more so though both scenes ended a bit too soon for my taste the comic relief meanwhile is nonstop and pretty much all good especially when and mera are bickering theyre a lot like emmett and wyldestyle from the lego movie only with stronger romantic overtonesit would be an understatement to say that has tight pacing with the exception of one inexplicable semi obligatory lyrical interlude this is not a movie that believes in slow buildups or stopping to catch its breath towards the end things keep speeding up more and more until everyones rushing through every plot twist and expository speech like theyve gone way over schedule and the crew is about to kick them out of their sound stage and its a good thing the pacing is fast or else the numerous plot holes would be even more noticeablelike why doesnt atlantis send emissaries to the surface to deliver a warning before declaring war why did mera sneak into atlantis to show him something that she could easily have taken to him how can the instructions for finding an ancient treasure involve something that wouldnt be built for millennia to come you dont get to ask these questions because by the time you get to them is punching a bunch of monsters in the facewhile the plot may not be anything special the visuals certainly are this is an absolutely gorgeous movie from the impressive set pieces and location shots in sicily to the futuristic glowing atlantean weapons and armor to the massive battle sequences every bit of this movie is a feast for the eyes the production design is honestly oscar worthy which is the only that phrase can be applied to this moviemuch of the dialog could easily have come from a saturday morning cartoon or a high school play sometimes thats clearly intentional meant to establish how clueless our protagonist is other times it just feels like noone bothered to review the script or read the lines aloud before shooting and the laughs are entirely unintentional sometimes i wonder how the actors are able to recite their lines without cracking up or why they didnt write new lines on a napkin between takes but hey i guess thats just part of the cheesy goodnessoverall this movie is dumb as all get out but fun enough to mostly make up for it may not be wonder woman much less avengers but its no dawn of justice or suicide squad either its a step in the right direction for dc and a pretty good popcorn flick,fantasy
okay so ive just watched this filmjames wan directed this well the scenes where just the characters are fighting are wonderful but the rest is okthe writing is poor and the characters are quite boring however this is one of the better dc films after wonder woman and justice leagueid watch this if youre invested in dc or if youre a fan but if you arent dont worry about itnow the story is very clich black manta is very under used and boring also the love hint toward arthur and mara is awkward and rushed  it feels like wan wanted to get through this films and go straight into the fightsthe music is very weird and out of place,fantasy
first off the bad sharks cant sit still they die and they definitely dont growl also mantas helm is too stupid for live action beyond that its a great adventure movie i love movies that take you to radically different locations as the original star wars trilogy did jason momoa does a really good job of lifting the mood out of the dc gutter so there might still be hope for the dcu,fantasy
theres no question that they really needed to cut at least 40 minutes out of this cgi monster at times it was way more fun then i was expecting but at a point every new video game type crescendo started to all look the same the cgi chaos actually became boringthe plot is nonsensical and the cheesy dialogue was dialed up way past high by the time the main bad guy declares himself the ocean master in full overthetop bmovie mode i reached my cheese limit power base also seemed all over the map in silly eye rolling ways one minute hes superfarting a submarine and lifting it out of the water and the next he has trouble lifting his own body weightwhat elevates this movie above the other atrocious dceu movies that have come before are the visuals the cast and some of the action beats the whole vs black manta scene was a joy to watch yes black manta has the silliest and forced inclusion in the movie but it paid off in that brawlthe entire cast was really good mamoa gets the praise but amber heard was amazing and perfectly cast the one edge i can give wbdc over what marvel has done is their casting of female leads as with wonder woman they allow their talent to be complete and captivating that means strength of character but also not afraid to show female skin or deny that their heroes can be feminine as well as tough well played and i hope it continues and hope that marvel learns from them in that regardoverall more fun than i was expecting and if they limit all the overused cgi cheese i would want to see more of these characters,fantasy
the film overindulged itself in special effects and big money action slowno shots that leave the entire film feeling less interesting due to a lack of a final big payoff while the final battle is expertly done many of the action sequence before fail to hold you in due to unrealistic happenings there are people who walk unscathed out of situations in which they should notand this draws you out of the action ruining the immersionthis film also falls flat with its villain ocean master who lacks any good motivation unlike the black manta villain placed in the subplot manta is an expertly executed villain who deserves to be the main villain all the actors pull out decent performances apart from wilson who feels out of place despite looking the part some of the stories content and little details may leave general audiences confused nonetheless this is a good introduction into a new far more badass vision of,fantasy
a rugged fish man with missile boost swim powers is reluctantly encouraged to take a birthright journey fantastical visuals but script was lacking,fantasy
best dc movie for ages not that it would be difficult as they have been craptastic i mean suicide squad justice league and fatman v superman im not going to say it was a fantastic film but it was better than the crap they normally churn out,fantasy
have to say i totally disagree i felt like the story was an overlycontrived combination of every superhero film ever felt it dragged on for too long and was overly predictable although i didnt take issue with them i also felt as though the obvious social references to do with pollution etc were added in for the sake of it and i felt like they didnt really add much to the story i did however enjoy the performances of jason momoa and amber heard ended up falling asleep about half way through and have to say i was thoroughly dissapointed,fantasy
felt like i was watching power rangers campy saturday am show black manta is a huge miss and unnecessary in the storyline pass on this dc installment loved jason momoa however he needs a better storyline and director,fantasy
afraid i hated this movie no script or storyline just tons and tons of unnecessary cgi this movie is cgi cgi cgi everything in this movie felt forced only redeeming factor was amber heard,fantasy
dc should really stop trying to be marvel they dont need to crank out massappeal action movies but should take their time to focus on story and character development this felt like the story was written by a procrastinating teenager the night before the plot is so predictable go get this item go beat up this guy go beat up another guy fall in love with the only young woman in the movie become king it seems like this movie was made to build up the dc universe not to actually entertain anyone jason was the only redeeming quality in the film try again dc,fantasy
so we watched the trailer and it looked like might actually have a storyline rather than just extended cgi sequences of fight scenes well kudos on the trailer you convinced us to fork out our dollars and go the cinema but the popcorn was the highlight of the eveningok ok i accept that this is a comicsuperhero movie and its aimed for a teens audience so in that respect it was sort of entertaining but really was such a mish mashthere were the attempted moralistic tales first about polluted water next about being judgmental about other cultures in this case the atlantians being judgmental about the surface world and a few others tossed in the movie gets a tick for trying but any decent environmental studies student could have improved that part of the scriptthe scenery was nice and the cgi passable  but certainly not out of this world even though it was trying to be out of this worldbut onto the weaknessesthere were the jokes hmm attempted jokes i dont think i actually laughed at any of them next whats with the 70s style riding on fish creatures with a harness when the main characters all have underwater superpowersand what about the plot well there are goodies and baddies a predictable love story and all that was really just a pretence for sequence after sequence of shootemup on land and in water and thats why it was so disappointing it offered very little for the viewer if you were after anything more than an action flick,fantasy
how on earth is this movie so highly rated i would happily watch batman v superman every day for a month before sitting through this film againlets get the very few positives out of the way jason is good as arthur curry hes humorous and much like what we got from him in justice league the action sequences and visuals can both be stunning and enjoyable at timesthe script on the other hand is awful this dialogue came straight from the room people laughed harder in the cinema when the film was trying to be taken seriously than when there was intentional humourblack manta complete shoehorn no need for him to be in the film whatsoever despite being a far more interesting villain they spend all of the time energy and budget on the stroppy and entitled brotherpeople will tell you that it was meant to be a silly and fun movie of course it is that doesnt mean they delivered on that effectively they couldnt decide if they wanted it to be thor ragnarock or lord of the ringsi havent wanted to leave a movie so much in a long time i strongly recommend saving your money as its 2 hours and 20 minutes yes really that you wont get back,fantasy
think about this the dark knight was just a few minutes longer than this movie though the effects and fighting choreography were much betterwhat the movie lacks is an interesting plot i fell asleep halfway through it and kept checking my watch to see how much longer the movie was the dark knight though several years older still has a better story and is still worth investing my time to watch you feel connected to the characters and even though you know how its going to end you still want to see the dark knight all the way to its ending feels like a fish of water you know whats going to happen everything is boring and repetitive from other superhero movies we cant compare to marvel because the way they were written in the comics are very much different but comparing this to dc movies like the dark knight it clearly falls short of the water a fish out of water needs boring too long and obviously a terrible super hero movie,fantasy
this was a decent film that was over shadowed by too many mistakes every good scene was proceeded or followed by one that never should have made the final cut the direction was poor with odd camera movements and dialog that ventures towards painful it seemed james wan not sure how long the dc universe would be around tried to pack the whole trilogy into this one film overly long with an ever shifting tone this movie couldnt hold it together until the finale,fantasy
yes you will see terrible reviews and also 1010 reviews for this movie honestly this movies not bad but its definitely not 1010 theres a ton of plot holes its really cheesy and goofy at points i could see what was gonna happen i mike away but did i care no this movie is just a fun time at the movies and if youre going to the movies to turn your brain off and just wanna see some awesome action this movie fits the bill dont think about it just enjoy it,fantasy
comparable to killmonger and joker for some reason,fantasy
but not the worst either granted that isnt a high barjust gonna put it out there though many will disagree mamoa does action hero well in my opinion there were a few other other solid performances but nothing anyone should be putting out there as their shining momentspecial effect blockbuster with over the top cgi while it was indeed visually stunning in spots i think they would have been better off investing in some better writers cgi should not take the place of a good storywhich brings me to the tired plot lifeless dialogue mostly 2d characters and much recycled cliched scriptdirecting and pacewell this one dragged this one would have had slow spots at 1 12 hours at almost 2 12 hours lets just say the editors should have gotten a bit busierim a comic book geek and dont claim otherwise i would love to see dc get their act together and start putting out great movies on a regular basis but i dont think this is one of them,fantasy
very predictable overall movie was good but took a bit long to get to the point your typical superhero storyline for a dc movie it is getting better compared to previous dc movies,fantasy
after years of dc failures i had no hopes for but to my surprise the film was good not as good as youd expect a film of this magnitude should be but worth watching atleast as a friday night popcorn featuremy main problem with the film is that it doesnt really know what it want to be as jason momoa tries to deliver puns without an ounce of comedic timing it seems more like a childish attempt at trying to be funny but at the same time the film has so many random events that are darker and dumber than they should be the scene where two frogmen are in a sinking submarine with one trapped under a heavy object seems beyond stupid as they both have breething equipment and should just wait until the room fills with water to be able to lift the object instead one pulls out a grenade and kills himself allthough it causes no harm to the submarine this is to setup just an extra enemy of but one that serve no purpose at all as he comes and goes and then goes for good without causing more than a water ripple in the movie overallit makes you wonder how a script like that passes the initial readingsame with the scene where atlanna stands on the docks i get that its supposed to be a cool scene but how long has she been standing there 20 minutes 2 hours this film doesnt know what it wants to be funny dark romantic and it falls short of all of itthe gci is amazing though and the films visuals are worth a viewpatrick wilson is great as orm and really gives the dceu a villain that has both depth and clear character motivation i hope to see more of his character in the future,fantasy
i so wanted this film to be good because i really like the main actor unfortunately it was worse than i thought full of pretty cgi with a very weak scripti really cant understand all the high scores from some people i was nearly falling asleep,fantasy
1 nicole kidmans plastic surgeon deserves an oscar2 there may be a cgi artist who also deserves an oscar for making nicole kidman look  not young but younger3 jason momoa is a pretty good actor and kept up with patrick wilson charles beach and kidman dafoe was obviously the best and dolph lungren was surprisingly goodspecial effects were good but while technically marvelous the director seemed to have put little thought or effort into making the effects coherent or supportive of the storyand the story well thats the real problem there were halfadozen stories crammed into this movie maybe a better writing team and director could have pulled it off but this group of moviemakers wasnt up to the challenge the audience was silent most of the movie i was the only one who laughed at any of the jokes and i laugh at anything well there was one funny joke but i wont spoil itbasically it was pretty lame for 85 of the time and while momoa kidman and dafoe did rally around the reunion story i dont think anyone cared much about the rest of the plot maybe they can pull off a justice league movie if they hire joss whedon or one of the good marvel directors,fantasy
i feel like dc went full marvel with this movie is a lighthearted actioncomedy that feels like a dramatic shift from the dark and brooding films that came before it in the dceu the storyline doesnt bring anything new to the origin story table and the acting is hit and miss but the visual effects are impressive this isnt one of my favorite superhero movies but itll be a fun one to watch with the kids,fantasy
must watch best dceu film ever super effects and the movie just rocks,fantasy
movie had great effects a solid soundtrack and amazing actors and a great director in james wan but there was no diaoluage in the movie and every time someone talks there is something action pack coming which is cool that there is so muxh action but we need people to conversate,fantasy
its hard not to compare it with the marvel movies visually beautiful but shallow in every other aspect,fantasy
 is okfairly formulaic sprinkled with some clichssome cool cgi and visualssome cringy lines and acting although overall decent actingfairly average superhero movie of the 2010s better than justice league at least which was a reliefid say early teenagers would enjoy this film the most of any demographic,fantasy
well it is not a castrophy or anything but it is the one dc film i had the highest expectations for because i really like the titular character the result was a corny and even for fantasy standards unrealistic yes i am talking fantasy realism here cgi overdoseokay what i liked jason momoa who has a great sense for self irony and comedic timing casting him in this role is one of the most creative and inspired decisions and it pays off he is truly great and part of the reason why aquman is one of my absolute favorites of the dc cinematic universe but not even he could save the often awful dialogue this terrible screenplay offers another thing i really liked were many of the actions scenes were very well put in scene save for all the slow motion moments also the first half of the film really promised a great fantasy tale with its own mythology i gave up on that thought in the middle part when many things motivations and actions just became ridiculous  and yes again for fantasy standards the ending was an overblown cgi fest with some really nice visuals  not the effects those were mediocre but the imagary was nice i really liked the score and loved the soundtrack decisions which were top notchabout the other actors amber heard was better than i expected but i could imagine many other actresses who probably had given her role the bite it deserves and was intended for nicole kidman was fine but she obviously did it for the fun yes she gets to kick some asses which was delightful and of course the paycheck but having her here gave the film something majestic willem dafoe was very boring  or bored i always felt he was not really feeling good about being into that cgi mess his facial expressions made you believe that he is constantly thinking of doing awful things to his agent dolph lundgren was fun and patrick wilson servable as a villain oh and that gets me to another thing black manta is probably the most useless villain in any comic adaptation  except maybe paul giamatti in the second spider man of the first spider man rebootit was fun yet overlong as long as it lasted but caused many head shakes from me and not in a good way,fantasy
acting is good fiction is great but director eyes is bad and writer is also bad vine blowing scene could won oscar but they didnt capture well,fantasy
decent imagery stale stroy and an actor that looks like marvels submariner makes for an odd movie the colors and imagery get a 510 the same stale approach to comic book storytelling and the obvious dc trolling of marvels namor gives it 010 go for the color and beauty thats it,fantasy
ive hated every dc movie so far but is a master piece every aspect of this movie is well made the casting  actingaction music the first thing i wanted to do was watch it again cant wait see it at the cinema for the best impact well done james wan,fantasy
one of the successful attractive movie by dci am a marvel fan but i love thisthanks jason moma superb acting,fantasy
well after watching some rather disappointing movies of late this one turned out to be quite enjoyable okay it is basically another superhero movie and one based on a character that none of the main characters on the big bang theory ever want to go dressed as to a fancy dress party it sort of made me wonder whether is one of those characters that nobody really likes all that much so i was scratching my head as to why it turned out that they decided to do his origin story as the next in the dc franchiselook if you are expecting anything on the scale of the mcu films then you are probably going to be a little disappointed like all of the other dceu films this is basically a standalone film in the shared universe in fact ive noticed that the other characters dont even seem to make an appearance but then again that probably has something to do with them wanting to maintain the focus on and not divert the audiences attention to some of the more popular heroes such as batmanid probably say that this is your typical origin film and as far as the story goes it is hardly original the film is set about a year after the events in justice league and is being approached to sort out a problem with atlantis the thing is that the people of atlantis have become so annoyed with the surface people treating the ocean as if it were some huge garbage dump that they decide that they want to do something about it honestly i really dont blame them but then again we happen to be the surface people and despite all of our crimes against nature for some reason we always deserve a second chancethis is where comes in he is to challenge the king for the throne particularly since he is first born the problem is that he is the illegitimate child of the queen so technically he doesnt count well because of that he decides to go on a quest for a legendary trident that he doesnt actually believe in but because the princess of one of the kingdoms is encouraging him to do so namely because she doesnt want to marry the king of atlantis he does so anyway so you can probably guess what happens from there and it does include a huge undersea battle as well as another enemy who wants to kill because his father died when they were attempting to capture a russian subanother thing about this film is that it is also technically a coming of age film though of course the coming of age happens to be or at least arthur curry becoming king of atlantis and actually taking his birthright however the other thing is that it was a little odd that it came after the justice league movie but then again this might have had something to do with them being a little apprehensive when it comes to a character like who tends to be considered somewhat ineffectual however i certainly hope this film does dispel that rather unfair association,fantasy
ive did a review earlier already but i forget to add thing here one there are also parts that were supposed to be humorous but just werent and then the do it again which makes it worse does anyone actually die in movies now,fantasy
the dialogue made me cringe several times the effects were great some of the casting choices had me scratching my head overall an entertaining movie but wonder woman still holds the top spot for me with the dc universe movies right now,fantasy
so i actually enjoyed the movie overall as in i was entertained but probably the wrong reasons i never laughed at the clearly intentionally placed jokes because they almost always fell flat and laughed out loud at scenes that were clearly not meant to be funny but felt so overdone that they slipped into the ridiculous and felt like a superhero spoof movie giant black manta helmet cliche slow motion shots with hair blowing in the wind and longing looks eating a rose cringy kissing scene really it was hilarious and i was waiting for charlie sheen and leslie nilson to turn up at any momentat times it felt like a text book rundown of every stylistic means from introduction to movie making 101 ca 1985the other thing that bothered me was that they clearly borrowed whole scenes and lines from other movies which i noticed a few times and it kind of ruined it for me i mean there was an entire chase scene completely ripped off independence day just saying,fantasy
the dc movies have in my opinion gotten a consistently bad rap from the critics i thought man of steel dawn of justice and the justice league were all better films than was reflected in the ratings and i enjoyed each of them so the 55 metacritic rating wasnt going to deter me when it came to i was prepared to like it i wanted to like it i didnt like itit seemed not to know if was dark batman v superman or light justice league and it was pretty clear after the first 30 minutes that it wasnt going to be aspiring to wonder womanlevel heights overrated though that movie was ive seen every featured actor be solidtoexcellent in other things but the performances were stilted in almost every case momoa in particular had some painfully awkward dialogue with amber heard it seemed as if they were trying  hard  to force a hemsworthportmanlike chemistry that just wasnt there and above all it was silly the theater i was in heard at least a dozen people myself included laughing aloud at moments that werent supposed to be funnymy 11year old liked it to that end its perfectly fine but marvel and dc have happily raised expectations over the last decade and just doesnt make the grade,fantasy
the second i watched the trailer i immediately was like this is one movie it seemed there was too much happening at once and after seeing the movie thats exactly the casethe main storyline is clear and easy to understand it promises a good movie for sure but the main storyline gets clouded with unnecessary sideplots which arent thought out very well this wouldnt have been a problem hadnt there been as man plotholesi get that dceu wanted to make it about pollution of the earths oceans but it felt forced the wannabe oceanmaster just seems like he wants to rulethe movie was very onedimensional the dialogue is the worst ive ever heard in a fictionflick too much cgi the soundtrack was beautiful though sometimes a bit misplaced maybemomoas performance was great he is very well suited for this role the cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful as well true eyecandyit isnt a superb movie but its a lot better than justice league and its certainly a step into the right direction for the dceu im sure that there are great moies coming,fantasy
maybe im just growing more discerning in my middle age but it seems to me these superhero movies are getting ever more formulaic and predictable served its purpose as mindless entertainment i suppose but a 7 out of 10 movie it is not i cant help but feel these imdb scores are manipulated significantly to sway the movie going cattlequestionable casting black mantis got his ass whooped with every appearance no plot twists its mediocre at best,fantasy
the earth is 70 water and little bit land this theory of atlantis or other advanced underwater civilizations is probably not a fairy tale in my honest opinion since a lot remains hidden from our surface existence this movie brings that belief to life and the need to respect underwater life forms and to eliminate pollution of the oceans as well this is an engaging action film and probably the probably the best dc movie so far too much violence and explosions from time to time but the plot carries on very nicely is a movie not to be missed we watched in imax and we went with an open mind and were thoroughly entertained by it thank you dc for this movie and looking forward to sequels,fantasy
film was purely the last jedi of dc with great cinematography and visual effects but the plot was boring and the length of it was too long i agree with the critics,fantasy
great visuals even though the colors made it a little be uneasy on the eye i am a dc fan so i can say that it is a pretty accurate depiction of the comic book series the plot was beautifully created but transitions could have been smoother,fantasy
i went to see this with another lady and of course you know we would have gone to see it even if everybody said it sucked because how could we resist jason momoa in a bathing suit lol but fortunately it totally didnt suckthe main characterthe character arthur curry is basically king arthur but underwater so its got that whole based on mythology thing going for it like the original star wars movie didthe visualsthe fx are great thats fortunate because there are a ton of them since so much of this movie is set underwater and both the underwater and non underwater scenes have a lot of action and fighting this is really a big cgi fest if you dont like looking at cgi you wont like it but this is the new cgi not that older stuff that will make you seasick because it flickers like older animation this stuff is seamless so give it a trythe storytheres a lot going on but basically the two intertwined plots are about a bad guy who is against for personal revenge and a bad guy who is against because game of thrones and sea nazis who hate genetic impurity oh and a love story nicely handled too not the one with arthurs love interest thats way too defeat big bad and get the girl i mean the one about his parents i liked itthe worldbuildinginevitably because this is a story about a hidden kingdom where the main character has to fight in personal combat in front of a crowd to win the throne it will be compared to black panther and its going to fall short in the worldbuilding dept black panther was a fantasy of africa in an alternate universe in which it had never been colonized the language dress customs etc were all based on real african cultures is not like that this story borrows the popular culture myth of atlantis which is not a real place ok i know there is probably an archeologist out there who is going to make an argument for a greek island but seriously pop culture atlantis is a fairy tale it cant possibly measure up and it wasnt intended toconclusionplus it has sharks oh yeah and some great actors too and russian language which is always a cool plus for me and dinosaurs a cool plus for betty its definitely not just for us ladies theres more than sex appeal going on here its fun see it,fantasy

a true comic book movie that was missing in a sea of comic book movies james wan did an awesome job he went all out and created a fun  colorful  funny and epic adventure the cast is great  even amber heard  jason momoa was born to play this part but patrick wilson dominates the screen as king orm  stunning visuals  fantastic soundtrack and if you leave the adult critical  analytical bull out of it and listen to your inner childyou know you love this movieand you should,fantasy
the movie has its cheesy moments but its much more fun and entertaining than most of the dceu movies much like wonder woman before it the film coasts by with the excellent performance from jason momoa and director james wan all while having beautiful visuals and stunning action sequences this is meant to be a fun action film its not meaningful and deep like wonder woman and its no where near as bad as suicide squad and bvs my only complaints are that the movie is a little long and like i said before some moments feel cheesy but its all meant in good fun not something dumbminded like venom one of the dceus best entries and i highly recommend it,fantasy
best dc film i have seen special effects were top story was really good actors were very good james wan best movie ever go to the cinema and see it for sure 1010,fantasy
 was the best superhero movie for 2018 it kept my attention till the end everything was great  the plot the cast and effects i really enjoyed the whole movie id recommend to watch the movie in 45xd and dive into atlantis d,fantasy
i loved this movie it was a fun engaging ride from start to finish it now rests as my favorite dceu movie now fair with me that i did actually enjoy the other ones also i own them all but this one now my favorite hell when the credits it people in the theater were actually clapping thats what you call a movie going experience if you wanna have a fun ride at the movies go see this one,fantasy
the most used word to describe is fun and it most certainly delivers in this regard from the beginning of the movie until the end the movie throws brilliant action scenes at audiences that are directed masterfully and overall paced great to keep audiences glued to the screen these range from oneonone fights to giant armyonarmy battles against the visually diverse settings of the seven seas and the surface world these different settings for the narrative and spectacle allow for audiences to distinguish the different cultures across the seven seas and allow the film to maintain colourful and vibrant unlike some dceu movies like stated though the directing is truly where the film shines james wan brings great impact scale and intricacy to the way the action and other moments of the film are shot with a memorable example being a chase scene unfortunately revealed in trailers for those who have seen them however where the directing adds a layer of great spectacle which carries audiences enjoyment from beginning to end those critical with story will surely find faults the narratives biggest issue after watching the film is its underdeveloped and simplistic nature characters from the protagonists to the villains lack deep and complex motivation for their actions throughout the film making some confused as to why the characters are so persistent in their goals also the film for some with perhaps lesser knowledge of the character and the world appears incoherent when jumping around to different atlantic civilisation interwoven with flashbacks which simply distract from the plot at hand as for its simplistic nature it follows a clichd formula of a road trip of sorts accompanied with fish out of water humour which varies in quality finally there is a revelation in the final act which is predictable and irrelevant that being said the film does occasionally hit emotional beats and manages to encapsulate much of the characters heavy law in its run time though it doesnt balance screen time for some characters as well as most would like overall despite the many story problems which may frustrate critical audience members the pure spectacle alone is a master to behold and the thin plot is overshadowed by the fun and enjoyable nature of the film which embraces its absurd routes similar to james wans work on fast  furious 7,fantasy
 is the best movie in the dc universe so far effects are good the portrayal of the comic is wonderful performances are great no matter what critics say you should see this movie my mind say its 90 but my heart says it deserves 10 i think i will follow my heart this time,fantasy
not amazing not bad but an improvement for a dc comic movie,fantasy
i sat sanwiched between my 20 year old daughter and her 13 year old half brother and they both fell asleep in the middle of this movie that was surprising because the movie didnt have a dull moment and was visually amazing but maybe that was part of the reason an overload of cgi antiaging and failing to slow down long enough for us to really connect to the charactersthe proscolorful visuals and unique underwater effectsfast pacingdiverse characters and creaturessome fan throwbacks like the telepathy ringsthe constoo much cgi making it too unbelievableacting was mediocreplot was predicatabletime was irrelevant and not respectedfaces looked almost animated and unrealistic if thats what saltwater does for aging im inthe distinction between humans and meta humans was not always respected as humans thrown and beaten severely often get right back up and continue the fight and the unclear rule about who can or cannot breathe above water was not well thought out they all evolved from land but then devolvedoverall it was entertaining but nowhere close to wonder woman i may have even liked justice league more than this one go see it in the theater for the visuals especially if you have passes or discounts eat some popcorn and turn your inner critic off and youll enjoy it enough,fantasy
great performance from jason mamoa great visuals and a ton of action make this an obvious win for the dceu after a fairly rough start with suicide squad batman v superman and justice leagueall of which i enjoyed its not nearly as good as wonder woman or man of steel but with that being said its still a pretty good movie its not perfect by any means dialogue pacing and narrative especially in the first half really bog this film down i liked this movie and i definitely recommend it to those who enjoy action comic book movies,fantasy
ill just make this short and quickprosamazing camera shots and awsome battle scenes the final battle is the one biggest and most visually amazing battles in the history of the superhero genre characters mix with each other well pretty good soundtrack beautiful visuals and great castconsa somewhat messy plot at points and some few cheesy linesconclusion is a visually breathtaking movie that stands with the likes of avatar and ends with a huge satisfying climatic battle although there is somewhat a disorderly plot but it just gets forgotten in a wave of dceu refreshment,fantasy
i honestly thought the movie was pretty good overall first i saw the movie in 2d and as i watched it thought that it really would be great in 3d so two days later i saw it in 3d i was so looking forward to seeing it in 3d because i saw all the opportunities for 3d to really shine again as it did in avatar im one of those people that really want 3d to succeed and come back though i may be in the minority it wasnt very long into the second time through watching it in 3d that it struck me the whole movie is just too darki dont mean that in the sense that its evil i mean its just too dark there were so many scenes that would have been so much better had we as the audience be able to see them and more light i know the whole thing is supposed to be under water but surely they could have explained their way around that it is my belief that are younger movie makers just dont have the background and basic fundamentalshow bright does a picture need to be or how long to display text so people have time to read it are just two things that popped out for me i believe dc missed a huge opportunity here can anyone describe the monster at the end of the movie i think not believe ratings could have been between 510 higher with more brightness and less artistic gray,fantasy
this was a good movie but i am confused why dc had to take so many parts from other movies i could identify at least 5 familiar movies by watching this one thor karate kid superman i could go on but why bother its disapointing considering how much they payed someone to write and direct it originality obviously is beyond them,fantasy
one of the most anticipated movies of the yearand it delivers what was expected of ithuge cgi spectacle and an absolute fun ridethe plot was pretty basic and straight forward to say the leastbut the way james wan presented it was top notchthe cgi scenes underwater are wonderful to watchthe stunt choreography and the cinematography in it are excellentthere was some unnecessary humor in the 2nd half that drags the movie a little bit but thats all i can complain about the moviethere is also a scene where james brings in his horror movie direction skills and it is an added bonusoverall an absolute fun ride and worth your money,fantasy
at the start of the movie when you see the storm troopers the cgi was great by the end of the movie i was thinking wow i havent enjoyed a fantasy film like this since lotr if thats your thing go watch it if not you may want to watch something else,fantasy
jason momoa literally is the movie he carries it like previous actionstars a la schwarzeneggerhe owns the funny badass and emotional well his father too scenes beside of that the cgi is well somehow it looks amazing and totally childish at the same time its better than batman v superman or justice league it also can hold up to some mcu flicks like antman or thorif you are looking for entertainment you may be pleased if youre looking for a great superheromovie youll be disappointedoh and to all of us who were introduced to dolph lundgren through this film do yourself a favour an go watch creed ii610,fantasy
brother orms hair changed length several times during the movie longshortlongshort,fantasy
although was one of the longer movies ive seen it was packed with the good stuff with barely any formal talk meeting and romance because its an action movie all that critics care about are the characters personalities and love it has quite a lot of cool kills and obviously stunts with pretty good effects and i enjoy the modern technology used in an ancientknown world,fantasy
 is almost the best dc film since the dark knight trilogy  its certainly more fun colourful and enjoyable than justice league batman v superman and man of steel wonder woman is still the benchmark but only just the film works well as both an origin story and a comingofage story arthur momoa is the offspring of tom morrison a lighthouse keeper and exiled queen of atlantis atlanna kidman making him halfman halfatlantean and the heir to the underwater kingdom of atlantiswe see arthur trained by vulko dafoe in flashbacks and helped in the present by mera heard to stop his stepbrother orm wilson from starting a war with the surface dwellers arthur has to embark on a journey to track down an ancient trident that will make him king of atlantis and unite the two realms theres enough tongueincheekness and charm from momoa to help you past some of the daft moments  mantas suit overall a weak villain octopus drums plesiosaurs underwater fire and giant seahorsesits not too long just over 2 hours and is fastpaced and much of the story makes it feel like a cross between indiana jones and lord of the rings with many of the underwater colours reminiscent of avatar  none of which are bad things the battle at the end is all a bit absurd but theres so much colour action and humour to make it worthwhile wish all dc films were as joyful as this,fantasy
pros you can tell they spent a lot of money on cgi and the visual effects which were amazing the action sequences were also above average this is coming from me a person who think almost every fight scene in hollywood movie sucks cause i compared them to jackie chan and jet li movies in the 90s the acting was good in my opinion but ill get to what overshadowed the acting in the cons section the storyline was decent they at least tried to make it relevant and that the foe had a purpose compared to steppenwolf in the previous movie that we should no longer speak ofcons the amount of cheesiness in this movie almost killed me i mean this is pretty close to the first superman movie where i just laughed for the entirety of the movie given how good some of these actors were i truly felt bad that they had to deliver some of these lines and i honestly dont understand how they couldve delivered these lines on set without bursting into crying laughter the second con is the story yes it was better than justice league but thats not saying much yes they gave the villains a purpose to do what they did but they didnt explore the characters or even try to make them more unique too many dramatic scenes with explosions out of nowhere and people walking out of the water slowly this is not bay watch or 007overall i didnt go into the movie with high expectations and i came out not surprised in any way i am happy with the visuals and actions in this movie but i suggest the writers put more time in making the dialogues better in the future dc movies,fantasy
dc still cant grasp the important scenes not coming off cornyit was a good movie not boring but still missing something,fantasy
first 30 minuets i enjoyed then its was action for the sake of action lacking substance,fantasy
i likes james wans which on a megabudget surprised me with a solid story and a big fish hook the sequences were well done and it has a big enemy but the only problems were the action sequences were too long some parts were too cheesy and too many explosions maybe if they focused more on the story and had more transitions during battle sequences id enjoy more id be down for a sequel,fantasy
too much water 010 ifi could give it that if i wanted sea documentary of wildlife i would have watched finding nemo,fantasy
it is a good movie well done good plot just i miss the soundtrack i mean i remember when heroes comics and similars movies had a great soundtrack anyway go to the movies and have a good time withyour family this film is nice,fantasy
it was a fun visual experience that gave us a more colourful insight to atlantis snyder imagined a different take on the character and wan continues by depicting him in a humorous and cool manner the story on the other hand was predictable and at times forced i would love to have seen this before justice league though which it was better than but thats nothing saying much 610 for me but art is subjective so go and see it for yourselves people,fantasy
it is not a well structurized movie especially it being an movie,fantasy
amazing movie filmed great it was simply a great story and well done overall enjoyed the cgi and the back story,fantasy
momoa is the best ever id seen him in a couple of movie and tv series he was good all the time for him like thor for chris hemsworthvisuals and effects the story all is 10 stars,fantasy
the wife and i went to see this and had a great time its funny and full of action not to mention that jason has a charisma that infects both male and femaletake it on faith that its worth spending two hours oncheers,fantasy
lets face it for the most part dceu movies critically have not been received well an ambitious project by director james wan attempted to turn this losing streak around and did it work yes delivers on almost every aspect the characters in this film are very well developed the cinematography is exceptional the story has high stakes and a surprisingly good antagonist any worries had about from 2017s justice league are completely thrown out the windowjason momoa is at the top of his game in this movie showing off both his dramatic and comedic chops amber heard also puts in a respectable performance as meraoverall i would highly recommend this movie to just about anyone heres hoping this is the start of a new direction for dc and their films,fantasy
ever since he was cast as i was excited to see jason momoa make this character his own i enjoyed his appearance in the otherwise problematic justice league and this should have been an enjoyable thrill ride it certainly could have beento be specific and somewhat spoilery my primary issue with this film really didnt have anything to do with momoas performance nor as a hero there were plenty of scenes which captured the titular character well if course there was going to be lots of underwater battles and even talking to fish all that was there trouble was for me there were very few scenes that werent ripped off from better filmsa few of the many examples young arthur is bullied while admiring beautiful creatures behind glass and then he communicates with said creatures and they assisted in not only thwarting the bully but helping to reveal his own powers if that doesnt ring a bell just rewatch the early scene from the first harry potter film and youll see essentially the same scene play out how to train your dragon offers similar material both in the long lost mother in the lost world but also in befriending the big baddie which even looks like the king sized dragon to fight his battle the display of the wonders of atlantis erpandorais so very reminicent of camerons idyllic world they should have paid royalties and the usurper to the throne battle disgrace and redemption so closely resembled the central storyline of black panther i wished that film was playing instead nearly every sequence immediately called forth another better film and for me played more as a supercut homage than an original film of course common themes and tropes abound in big budget films such as this but generally they reframe them into something new altogether there was nearly nothing original in this filmthat is not to say it was completely devoid of entertainment the third act was by far the strongest despite following standard superhero format the sea battle was exciting though quite similar to the land battle of avatar the final mano a mano includes the requisite good guy fighting bad guy throwdown just as you might expectin all i felt that what promised to be a new take on a weak dc character falls not on its vision but in a lazy script that neither expands this characters interest creates excitement to ever see this character again that is a pity because even after seeing this film i still love jason momoas i just wish the makers of this film did as well,fantasy
the first twenty minutes of the film are well worth its own movie after that the movie struggles to find its overall tone message story and any original thought the inventive cgi are just action clips from other action blockbusters that were actually worth the money some examples include the rooftop scene from the fast and furious franchise pitch black a sudden appearance of a kaiju similar to godzilla or pacific rim and journey to the center of the earth plus many more im much more a dc fan than marvel but marvel movies are so much more worth the time and money the income of this movie is nothing more than a marketing scheme by the movie industry i honestly hope that dc will pull a new 52 scenario and completely restart their franchise,fantasy
film  la physique et  lesthtique plus que douteuse,fantasy
one of the best movie i ever watched after the movie avatar great work done by james wan far beyond super heros movie  this is how you make jealous to marvel character,fantasy
like many other reviewers have pointed it out is in my humble opinion the best movie yet by warner bros and dc probably beating out wonder womanjames wan the directed has done a fantastic job there are no dull moments in the film the action is top notch the story is simple and perhaps predictable but youll not regret sitting through till the endwhat i liked most about this film was its experimentation with colours unlike most other dceu films actions scenes and set pieces shot at daytime look equally amazing if not morethe cast is great the sound and visuals more than greati would definitely recommend watching this movie to everyone,fantasy
good acting good humornot excellent but it deserves at least 108it is great improvement for dc films,fantasy
theres campy acting momoa is not a strong lead plot holes and a scattered storytelling  but the sheer scope makes up for it theres so much going on here in terms of sheer scale  its like 2 star wars episodes back to backif you get a chance to see it in 3d  do it this is one of the few movies that makes full use of 3d effects to enhance what you see you can tell it makes a big difference in the vastness of the underwater worlds depictedcampy  but still wow,fantasy
i would actually rate this movie 85 out of 10 and not 9 because its definitely better than an 8 but it isnt really a 9 due to reasons that i will get into however i will be generous and round it up rather than downthe first twothirds of this movie are pretty much exceptional barring minor pacing and plot issues the creativity is unreal and i have to admire james wan and the entire cast for doing such a great job and giving such a distinctive and fresh thematic and audiovisual style that i found immensely enjoyable and for being unafraid to actually try and tell a storywithout spoilers these minor plot points are eventually explained but suffice it to say that its better to give your audience all of the necessary information before your action sequence starts rather than after it or you risk the audience asking why is this happening rather than engaging in the actionstill it didnt really detract from the movie too much and all cases where this happen are eventually explained properly if you can be patient and just roll with it for a bithowever from a logical standpoint the movie kind of fails in the third act too many parts were a bit of a stretch for me or just flat out cgi nonsense lighting flares underwater and is pretty much the only reason im not rating this 1010yes its a superhero movie i understand that but it doesnt mean we need to throw normal physics out of the window entirelyoverall a very fun and engaging movie with an actual plot and surprising emotional depth pun intended but just roll with it when it gets too silly towards the end,fantasy
they are so damn clueless marvel fansavengers has got 11 points more than guardians great blade matchless deadpool wow avengers infinity war good but avengers one and two are only for hardcore fans with a very childish sense for humor and a need for thin storys and bad effects got a great new world a lovestory good jokes at the right time great characters nicole kidman william dafoe amber and the greatest of all time,fantasy
i saw someone in another review say that the 1010s are bots i hope sobecause thats really the only explanation i can understand who would give this a 10the movie isnt bad youll be entertained if your expectations arent too high but theres some bad acting and really cringe worthy lines some of the plot doesnt make sense and the parts that do are 100 predictableordinarily i would give this movie a 6 or even a 5 but there are two redeeming graces that make it stand outfirst the visuals yes about 80 of what you seen on screen is cgi but it blends very well and does not look out of place if you dont notice it who caresin the age of marvel star wars and other spectacles its not easy to impress me with visuals alone what really pushes this one over the edge is the art direction its creative beautiful and sometimes frighteningthe second redeeming aspect of this movie is a very heart warming love story its not even close to the focus of the movie a second love story gets much more time and falls completely flatbut the first love story is a surprising spot of tenderness in a blow um ups blockbusterthis movie is a solid 7 the people giving it 10s are raising your expectations way too high if you believe them now youll probably be very disappointed when you see itdont expect too much and youll enjoy yourself,fantasy
 is every bit a super hero movie with just about every cliche youd expect its fun and beautiful to watch though some of the visuals look like theyre pulled straight out of other cgi heavy films jason mamoa carries the film he had great comedic touch in a movie that didnt seem to take itself to seriously overall a fun watch easily the 2nd best dc film behind only wonder woman an encouraging step in the right direction,fantasy
first of all fine production values great effects and cinematography good acting by all the principal actors amber heard who is normally nice eye candy was surprisingly good as female lead her costume should have been a tad tighter other actors were quite good good villain actor overall i loved the way the movie looked they kept well to the dc universe mythos story progressed well the dumdums at rotten tomatoes have frequently missed the mark on many good movies formulaically criticizing a certain type of movie unless it falls into the preapproved guidelines that have cooked up this movie is a good time at the theater plain and simple and it is rewatchable it is definitely a big screen movie and should be seen there it will find its way into my streaming library,fantasy
worth watching and by far the best dc movie exclude the dark knight trilogies,fantasy
dont miss the opportunity to see this amazing who transcends the super hero genre almost scify and wonderful scenarios very diverse expanding the universthe level of the details of the cgi its incredible and the messages of equality of gender the diversity and the polution of the seas add great value the director redifine the genre and give us more than we expect jason momoas is viril strong funny and vulnerable representing a positive male model according to this times also his co stars strong womens delicate and inteligent well represented as a female heroes should be watch it,fantasy
seen a lot of movies but nothing quite like this a really good action flick,fantasy
it was a very smart beautifully film come on it was a great film from the actors to the set designs the art in the film the production the special effects were on point theres no need to hate i thought it was an amazing film and ill watch it again,fantasy
 the best dc movie ever very bright and very epic movie good action very good bad guys in short the this christmas best dc movie a movie that must be watched in cinema,fantasy
vfxstoryfinally dc is in right track love the movie very much,fantasy
this is no doubt a great movie the concept was also spot on cinematography was great but the story line was more similar to that of black panther i would have loved to see some more twist in the the movie as it was too predictable everyone who came out the theater after watching this movie was smilling seems they all got thier moneys worth overall its still and enjoyable and good movie,fantasy
this movie is visually amazing and does a great job of portraying character and set of powers there are some pacing issues and some scenes just dont fit in the grand scheme of the move but it is very entertaining still the visuals are stunning and colorful and great cinematography as well really adds to the atmosphere of darkness and vastness of the oceans dont get me wrong the movie has its weak points and is a difficult character to portray on the big screen but i believe james wan has made a solid entry to the dc universe with that being said this movie is not for everyone and some people just wont get it,fantasy
another great full family friendly values from dc its all the opposite of the junk movies created by marvel,fantasy
just got back from seeing this movie and let me tell yall something it was a good movie i enjoyed myself so much jasons acting was adorkable the whole movie and badass after he got his gold and green suit on which in itself almost brought me to tears the women acting and fighting were awesome amber heards mera was a brilliant female lead nicole kidmans atlanna took me to a place i never thought id go with her as an actress she did pretty damn good with her action sequence oh each and every actor from the infant to the adult that they had portraying arthurs character were the cutest things i was momswooning all over the place go see this movie the cg was insane the final battle i couldnt keep up there was so much to look at all of the digital effects were genius and last but not least the villains were so damn relatable it was hard to have bad feeling for them and i actually small spoiler would have thrown the damn trash back on land too if i was orm anyway go and see it it was a good time with or without kids,fantasy
the film was better than any other dceu movie arguably however tonaly it was inconsistent the music played a hand in that the script pretty standardthe fights had very little cuts due to the amount of cgi while in theory it should be better than over using cuts see every bad action film personally it takes me out of the movie because at points the animation was worse than at others particularly the first fight scene the costumes felt like a power ranger costume designer came up with them and that further added to tonal inconsistenciesanother issue for me was the fact seemed invincible how can i care for a character whos pain tolerance i dont knowfinally while the film is dumb fun it is not worth anything at most above 65 this is my objective view personally i didnt like it and people giving this 9s are completely out there review it as a film a piece of art not a dceu film at the time of writing it has a 77 ,fantasy
 is another superhero flick squeezing too much story in 3 hours obvious mcuinspired scenes like mcu amalgam trident duels were really well done albeit familiar and italy battle was tastefully brutal overall good but hardly original 35scales,fantasy
 has never been one of my favorite superheroes but i was looking forward to this film because i like james wan as a director dc has mostly failed miserably over the years trying to create a universe to compete with marvel they do have what i think is the best superhero trilogy in the dark knight films but since then they gave the keys to zack snyder to start their universe with man of steel even though i kind of liked it i never really agreed with his take on superman my fears were confirmed when batman vs superman came out that film was embarrassingly bad snyder had taken two of the greatest comic book heroes and stripped just about everything we love about them the only good thing i can say about that film is that it is only slightly better than batman and robin directed by joel schumacher but that film was just horrible in every way justice league was ok but not near as good as the avengers series then finally dc got it right with wonder woman that film was great it presented an origin story but it also made the main character something that mr snyder didnt do wonder woman was a heroin she wasnt the brooding bores that batman and superman were in his films the film was fun and rousing as i think these type of films should bewell dc has finally got has gotten it right again with i hadnt really thought much about jason momoa as in justice league but here he makes the character his own the setup is relatively quick with nicole kidman as atlanna an princess that had escaped atlantis to avoid marrying a man she didnt lovetemuera morrison plays thonas curry a lighthouse keeper that notices atlanna on the shore and rescues her they fall in love and have a baby named arthur shortly after he is born they are attacked by atlantian soldiers and she goes back to atlantis to protect arthur and thomas then the film moves forward to rescuing a submarine from pirates in a great action scene in that scene yahya abdulmateen ii is introduced as david kane a villain that would later become black manta then the film goes to atlantis where we see that orm played by patrick wilson he is arthurs half brother and wants to wage war with the surface world arthur is almost killed with his father in an attack with a tidal wave but is saved by mera played by amber heard she is an atlantean that has been chosen to marry orm but tries to convince arthur to come to atlantis to claim his birthright as king he refuses he had been rejected by atlantis as a half breed mera convinces arthur to go with her to help prevent orms attack on the surface once in atlantis they meet vulko played by willem dafoe vulco had trained arther in his youth to fight at the request of arthurs mother he tells arthur and mera that they should find the trident of atlan a weapon that had been wielded by the first king of atlantis if arthur would get this magic artifact he would he accepted as king of atlantis suddenly they are ambushed and arthur is captured but vulko and mera escape once captured orm confronts arthur and tells him tht their mother had been executed for the crime of having a half breed son arthur challenges orn to a duel in front of all of atlantis do determine the rightful king orn defeats arthur but mera rescues him they both travel to find the trident of atlan they go to the sahara desert to find where the weapon was forged there they unlock a holographic message that leads them to sicily they find the coordinates to the location of the trident orm had given david kane weapons to kill arthur he used that technology to built the black manta suit when arthur and mera are in sicily black manta attacks them almost killing arthur before being thrown from a cliff to his apparent death mera helps arthur heal and tells him to embrace his destiny as a hero as they go find the trident they arrive to their destination but are attacked by some monsters called the trench but are able to escape they find a wormhole and are transported to a ocean at the center of the earth there they are unexpectedly reunited with atlanna she had been sacrificed to the trench but was able to survive arthur goes to retrieve the trident facing karathen the creature that guards the trident arthur is able to prove his worth and reclaims the trident arthur emerges with the traditional suit along with atlanna and mera he goes to confront orm orm had already started the war that would eventually go to the surface once orms followers see that arthur has the trident if atlan they embrace him as king arthur then confronts orm and demands that he renounce the thrown after they fight orm is deafeated orm then discovers atlanna is alive and accepts his fate atlanna finally returns to the surface and reunites with thomas as arthur ascends to the throne in atlantis succeeds at being an epic superhero story james wan and company have created a very entertaining and i evolving film and as in the case of wonder woman made what he should be a hero to root for jason mamoa plays arthur with a lot of humor but also with heroic conviction all of the cast is good especially amber heard as mera she and mamoa have good chemistry the look of the film is predictably spectacular the world of atlantis is really great to look at even though it is obvious that the characters are not underwater the effects make it as believable as it could be but the characters and story make the film enjoyable im glad that dc has finally found the way to do justice to their heroic characters i hope with the success of this film janes wan is given the chance to reboot superman the right way i really enjoyed,fantasy
dont let the title deceive you is not a hero movie but is a scififantasy adventure movie like percy jackson where heroes have to travel from places to places according to clues to claim the magical itempros nice exploration of atlantis background good chemistry between arthur and mera variety of environments easy to consume as a family movie beautiful visual styleconstoo longthe ending of the heroes quest didnt yield much satisfactionfelt flat in several partsstory is suit to be in either a multipart format or as a series of comic books instead of a single one film it felt like a fun ride that never get your emotion high enough and flat at some points because they tried to cram the movie too many stuff which result in a movie that is too long for its format and heroes quest that doesnt yield satisfaction at allalmost everything in the film was told in a very obvious way without a room for any interpretation as its aimed at broader audienceshere come the good partsthe movie isnt without its merit as mera and arthurs interaction are fun to watch both banter from time to time almost constantlyarthurs character development also felt developed progressively especially when compared to a man whom care nothing about the world from jla which is justified in his background exploration,fantasy
when i got home from the cinema i was 101 sure i would find here only negative reviews and then i saw people actually loved it enough to give it 1010 seriously i dont understand this is so bad that it was actually kind of good i mean it has no screenplay absolutely no acting no structure  nothing but at the same time for some reason i cant say it was boring to watch it was a plain circus just a ridiculous show a performance full of booms and baamsin the beginning there was a russian submarine hijacked by pirates swam around while wearing his usual rocknroll jeans and boots decided to help the russians killed all the pirates without forgetting to pose heroically in between pushed the submarine from the ocean to the surface in reality that would kill everybody in the submarine and the submariner were like its hooray you saved us so after such an amazing start you just relax let your sarcasm loose and try to enjoy this crappy ass showthis movie reminded me of the first capitan america dumb serious the characters try to copy marvel heroes and joke but without any success and all story just falls apart im really sorry for nicole kidmanwillem dafoe and of course patrick wilson they are great actors and now they have to be a part of this though it looks like this movie is an absolute top for jason momoa he doesnt look like a real actor though i seriously believed the director would surely use his natural charisma he didnt literally anybody could play in this movie the role is so dumb and empty you could put anybody in those ocean king of vegas clothes and yeah im afraid they will make the second part but im sure as hell wont give a cent to watch it,fantasy
jason momoa and amber heard are really likeable and engaging but i found the cgi to be distracting and overwhelming in places it should enhance reality not be so far removed that it becomes ridiculous speaking of ridiculous amber heards character mera is absolutely awesome so why did they dress her up in an unspeakably oldfashioned catsuit thats all cleavage and high heels plus arial hair who the hell goes out to fight dressed like that even superheroes need some self respect this to me seemed totally outdated particularly post metoo grow up hollywood women need to see cool women in films too you know and they dont all need to be the same 1960s stereotype 52 of the world population is female and here we have only 2 female characters amazing actresses both and thousands of men this is so tiresome,fantasy
after basically giving up on the dceu with only one halfcompetent movie so far wonder woman and four of the worst disaster i have ever seen i have to say i am decently positive aboutdo not get me wrong this is a really bad movie and it has a lot of bmovie kind of feel to it but dare i say it it is pretty fun not fun as in this is a good movie because this is trash but fun as in it tries so hard and it fails and it has so many moments i burst into laughter over how inapt and dumb it is the main bad guy is so hilarious i can almost recommend this movie for him alonethere are soooooo many stupid moments and that bmovie feel never washes away pun intended and we see some weird attempts to make political statements  and those facts together ruin the moviethe basic plot is very generic and those comparing this movie to black panther would not be wrong it is very similar almost copy paste similari am being generous and give this movie a 210would i recommend this ouhm not really i mean if you get a bottle of whiskey that you can empty and throw in the ocean like like to do and you watch this movie at the same time it might not be so badthis is the second best movie of the dceu so far after wonder woman imagine that 210 and it is the second best movie of an entire franchise how is that for a record yea yea plenty of weirdo people went out to see this movie mostly because they spend enormous amount of money on marketing in china but also other strange folk why what the beep made you think that this would be a good idea together with the transformers movies aqaman is the dumbest movie of all time that has made so much moneysuper generic bmovie badly acted bad cgi horrible villains but also funny flat story and script do not watch it and if you do load up with lots of alcohol because otherwise you cannot enjoy this,fantasy
allow me to quote raj from the big bang theory i dont want to be he sucks he sucks underwater he sucks fish peeoh dc i thought youd learned wonder woman was proof wasnt it all of the elements of great movie storytelling were present it was wonderfully cast carefully scripted the film evolved at a crisp but comfortably artistic pace a tribute to careful editing and when the magnificent amazon finally revealed her power at exactly the right moment as she stepped majestically onto the battlefield goosebumpsso how do you explain the obvious regression ofthe casting ismeh jason momoa is a fine physical specimen of the fish man but his hero is startlingly flat the rest of the cast might work fine if this was a made for television movie but it isnt its a major theatrical vehicle and dc has failed to bring in a suitable stable of supporting actors to carry the weight and even though its unfair to continually compare the dc universe to marvels the parallel is unescapable ant man who ranks in the marvel pantheon probably even lower than where stands in the dc hero collection carries two standalone movies effortlessly struggles from the beginning of the film through its tedious center to its final cheesy conclusion to justify the films reason to live storytelling is the key and where wonder woman earned a welldeserved a receives an equally merited d perhaps if the writers had chosen to meditate for two hours on the characters back story and built methodically toward a big reveal i might be submitting a very different review but instead the writing bumps along like an old roller coaster jerking us through rickety rails of track always in a hurry to get us to the steep climb and the furious fall to the end none of it is satisfying instead of feeling like a big budget superhero film the movie increasingly feels like a sad mishmash of godzilla and finding nemo although nemo did a much better job of creating an interesting undersea worlddc continues to give us heroes but cant seem to connect us to them its the primary flaw in the dc universe its characters are too cold and detached from the audience its a problem that will only be fixed through better movie storytellingi rank movies like i rank potatoes because i love potatoes receives my instant mashed potatoes ranking which roughly translates this way they will do if youre in a hurry but they generally suck and in this case raj was right these taters suck underwater,fantasy
not bad for an origin story oh yes the money  gotta have one or more sequels although this was long and slow enough to present any coherent story a person could want been done before plenty of times throughout the history of moviemaking these days there is that simple matter of greed i was yawning well before the end excellent for episodic television ,fantasy
sadly did not see the marvelous features other viewers claim while i am a huge fan of the actors especially dafoe kidman momoa and wilson the screenplay and editing scrambled the story horribly the resulting mess ruined an otherwise fine dc fantasy even remarkable performances and special affects could not salvage the movie cannot recommend,fantasy
again a movie that was so hyped up before that i really expected it to be great butbesides a bit of a story in the beginning there wasnt really much of a storylinetoo many fight scenes and too little conversationi really hoped they would have showed more depth in the characters good idea but bad executionspecial effects were goodjason momoa fits well as the but they dont show much of his acting skillsoverall a great movie to get a great nap in,fantasy
aqua man could be placed up there with some of the greatest in terms of its visuals the movie features bright vibrant colors welldone cgi and amazing fight sequences but in terms of plot and character development i dont think this movie was the best the characters lacked the depth that would generally cause you to fall in love with them and i found myself experiencing very little emotion for the entirety of the film everything seemed to come really easy to the mc and the plot was predictable like really predictable by the end of the film only people i cared about were the parents of aqua man another thing that was really annoying was the gross overuse of music you know that powerful crescendo movies use whenever the main villain hits the screen well this film used it like eleven times every time any antagonist came to the screen youd hear the loud minor chords and every time aqua man accomplished the tiniest feet the music got loud and majestic after 30 minutes of the film the sounds will really start to annoy you and youll be begging for a quiet scene in general this was certainly not the worst film but wasnt the best either if you go see it youll enjoy it but it wont be memorable,fantasy
after seeing what dc was capable of with justice league i found myself with low expectations for the reason why i was even interested in the movie was the updated styling of the character in my opinion justice league could have used momoas more to improve the film so this film had to be better than justice league right not so much i found the film highly predictable the humor used seems forced and is more rollingoftheeyes cheesy than funny what saves the movie is jason momoa his talent for acting is very noticeable and that is why i gave this film an ok score my wife liked it however,fantasy
the first 10 minutes of the movie will already tell you that it will be full of crappy cgi lousy storyline and unimaginative script the movie is corny at the maximum there are many underdeveloped characters and scenes particularly the pirate am not sure why the director wants to provide that much story to an insignificant character in the movie skip this movie just watch the trailer,fantasy
first i didnt read any comic books or any dc comic either but i watched justice league i dont want talk too much about justice leaguebut after watch any dcs film make me feel liked im like freshman in dc math class my teacher is using few day teaching me what is math then my teacher is taking me to finish final immediate my points is had so many story plot didnt talk same like justice league but director is pushing so hard to finish story i knew dcu is tried to copying the avengers before avengers mcu already produce lots of films to tell us what is iron man captain america ect we were watching every hero grows up but dcu is trying to put equivalent job in a film as same as director wen is pushing story so fast i the sorry had four different water race but he didnt talk too much about it and he didnt talk too much about human it shows like this is all story is about other world stuff it is not link with human but the acctually conflict is cause human wen didnt show enoughsecondly showed early in china im chinese so i read some news and comments from china internet like weibo before i watch this film is successed in china most comments said this is good movie good cg good actor soso story but good director i agree that by the way this film is better than other dc film but all had same problem so my question is these problem is made by every dc directors or because dcu management wants using less money for making as same money as mcuthank you for reading sorry for bad grammar,fantasy
good action movie though dramatic moments built in all around made me smile a lot clearly not the best dc creation,fantasy
the story is faily simple and largely predictible but only very loosely connected to reality which may appeal to many viewers most of the film consists of eyeblistering computer animation that i found slightly boring but the accompanying very loud noise keeps one alert,fantasy
after being recommended i ended up giving it a shot even though i really wasnt too excited for itit was ok and there were some underwater scenes which were simply beautiful so cgi was pretty awesome where sea creatures etc were concernedhowever i just wasnt feeling the whole sea queen lighthouse keeper romance it just seemed rather forced for some reason nicole kidman just looked a bit ridiculous maybe it was the weird looking hair or the cheaplooking outfitthe dialogue overall wasnt great even though there were a few good jokes some serious scenes actually made me laugh once again sometimes it felt pretty forcedalso didnt see the need to have them kiss at the end i thought we were over that cliche its 2018however jason momoa was definitely a good choice for the role and so was amber heard they did great jobs despite it all willem dafoe was pretty random but awesome as one would expecthonestly the fact that ive never really read any comics or been interested in the characterjustice league in general probably didnt help im more of a marvel person and i enjoy the little easter eggs in the movies whereas here i didnt connect with the characters or the story as muchto sum up if youre looking to entertain yourself for 2 hours i guess go for it,fantasy
long a joke for many non comic book fans thanks to the film bearing his name is now a much more respected character jason moama gives the character a sense of place there are an number of great action set pieces the first of which is arthur fighting priates on a submarine while another has arthur and mera played by amber heard have to fight and elude an number of baddies with support from the likes of nicole kidman willem dafoe dolph lundgren and julie andrews providing the voice of a giant sea monster offers great entertainment,fantasy
 was good in the justice league movie last year and they picked a good actor who fitted a dark gritty version of joan momoa now we have a full on movie momoa amber heard willem dafoe patrick wilson nicole kidman and directed by james wan makings of a great edition to the dceu the problem is it runs on a by the numbers story for the main character warner bros did something out of the blue they had the ensemble movie first with each new character a follow up solo movie the beginning of gives us a backstory with the main movie focusing on the aftermath of steppenwolfthe story takes place sometime after the events of justice league with arthur curry being forced into the open when orm his halfbrother and king of the legendary atlantis is trying to begin a new war with the surface world now arthur has to embark on an adventure with another atlantean mera to find a way to defeat arm and unite their two worldsfor positives the visuals are amazing atlantis looks phenomenal the action set pieces are well done especially the continuous shots that wan is known for in his action films the set designs and costumes are inspired especially the classic suit and black mantas armour the budged for the cgi was definitely well spent we get the studio mandated third act battle but i didnt care we get war sharks and war sea horses and king crabs and a giant kraken thing with missiles and lasers on them smashing into each other while flaming balls of molten magma are being flung around on catapults i felt like i tripping balls for 10 minutes but its so worth itthe film has fun montages and flashbacks and funny moments of humour sprinkled throughout amber heard is very good as mera the way the atlanteans live and function is interesting to see the film is well paced and keeps you interested cant say there were any times it was starting to bore meall that being said is very good on its own if it had been the first instalment in the dceu or the second after wonder woman the dceu could have continued on a better thought out franchise instead henry cavill and ben affleck have left batman v superman and justice league were messes and shazam doesnt come off like itll be a surefire hit at all wonder woman 1984s already in production so the train cant stop now and the dceu movies are heading into preproduction before any well thought out thinking can be done its gonna be distracting going forward i still think they should have rebooted it post justice league especially since theyre gonna have to don cheadle superman and batman now the dceu still has no concrete plan for their universe and they certainly dont have a competent kevin feige figurebut for two hours of fast paced action packed entertainment with a charming lead and supporting characters definitely give a see,fantasy
ok i rarely like comic flicks so i could be bias and i had to keep reminding myself that it is a comic storyfirst of course the aesthetics were second to non although i wondered how nicole kidman could fit her outfit 20 yrs later but i personally really liked the sea scenesalso the only reason i went to see it was jason maoma lord help me sorry lisa for my dirty thoughtsok the plot could have meshed together better some areas i was lost like wtf is that who is that why did he die so quick who was he really i thought he was going to be a strong contender there were a lot of greek and egyptian references and that thing rode on the head looked like baphomet like seriously guys why again the storyline could have more put together in some places it was very elementary and cliche but again its a comic story so it serves its purposei did enjoy it i wish more scenes were under water,fantasy
despite being a good origin story could have been a lot better in terms of story and villains considering that both had so much potential which was wasted on a predictable with underdeveloped villains plot that eventually turns out to be an enjoyable visually stunning comicbooky superhero adventureprossatisfying origin storywell directed actionsolid performancesinteresting scorebeautiful visualsconspredictable plotunderdeveloped villainsexploring atlantis in a pretty shallow way6510 descent,fantasy
it is one of the better movie in the dceuthe visuals were just mind blowing and jason mamoa was just phenomenalhowever the narrative could hsve been better and one thing and i didnt like in the movie were the scenes were fights were provoked they looked almost like jump scaresneverthelessthe movie gives an overall delight and joy to watch it in the cinema,fantasy
the story was okay the acting was alright the visual were incredible but that feeling im telling you it really felt like you were watching a comicbook and this is the first time i truly feel that they are not trying to be relistic they finilly let go that nolan religion and embrase what they truly are with the costums and everything and men thats something worth watching,fantasy
damn is the real dealafter watching the portrayal of jason momoa as the i now have a favorite movie from the dc universe its more than all the batman movies its more than all the superman movies or any other dc movies that came out already the best thing that this movie has are the nods to some familiar scenes that we may never realized weve grown in to it the discovery channel documentary about mermans and how they came to be the zombie apocalypse with that torch waving among the hordes of trench the gi joe scenes and the james bond chase scenery in italy the journey to the center of the earth the jurassic park scenery the nod to the little mermaid not to obviously see the whole ariel look of the princess but man look at that scenery in the atlantis the octopus drummer the turtles the ring of fire the throne ursulas pet and who would forget sebastian being too op as grand finalelove how they build the story without messing up with the entire concept love how they build him jason momoa and finally seeing him in his suiteim excited to see his next enemy that helmet from black manta at the end seems familiar,fantasy
with a great performance by the cast and good special effects this film ends up being entertaining and at times exciting it would have improvements by some secondary characters and parts of the plot that seem a bit boring,fantasy
james wan youre the guy  already since the trailers this movie already promised a lot and it was a beautiful one of a trip to atlantis sensational  wan manages to deliver the basics of the heros origin despite feeling a bit rushed in telling the story and the movie having 2 hours and 20 minutes the action of the film is wonderful and the soundtrack that accompanied the action scenes were amazing i had the slight sensation of the action of the film always staggering and getting bigger and bigger until arriving in the epic final battle lord of the rings style and still see it in imax and with a sensational sound i was totally delivered the movie has its problems some jokes and there musics badly placed in strange moments causing a climax break i missed a tragedy in the film at least i think atlana should die i thought that nicole was only going to make this movie but it seems that no i missed it too a little more drama but the film compensates for this in all other issues until i see arthur curry from comics in momoa in some glimpses of his acting there after he returned to be momoa kkkkk cast score ok script wan managed to adapt atlantis throne without putting the league together which i found very skillful on his partso i say that the result is more positive than negative the films of heroes have to be like that embrace the exaggeration and that the wan did with mastery do not try to put some kind of sense of reality in something that does not have stories in comics are very exaggerated and i want to see it on the cinema screen and also have to respect the original material and try to be as faithful as possible to these characters in their respective media now all that remains is to wait for the 2nd to come,fantasy
the much awaited dc movie was good but in parts the good parts were supported by splendid performances by jason momoa and amber heard nicole kidman did a fine job as well the visual effects were great and battle scenes were legit the only issue with the movie is that the storyline was little weak and stretched i got bored in few occasions but it was compensated by the caste and direction so i would recommend watching this popcorn movie over the weekend but dont expect too much out of it,fantasy
jason fits the character so much love the storyline love the cgi love everything about this movie,fantasy
dont get me wrong this is one of the dumbest cheesiest needlesly long films ive seen all year but the movie knows it and instead of playing it safe james wan executes it with so much heart and soul that makes it one of the most fun and unique experiencies ive had all year,fantasy
dont get me wrong this is one of the dumbest cheesiest most ridiculous and needlesly longer films ive seen all year but the movie knows it and instead of playing it safe james wan manages to execute this with so much heart and soul as he possibly can and makes it one of the most unique experiences ive all this year,fantasy
movie is after the events of justice league and the landscape as well as visuals were absolutely outstanding vision for the movie was outstanding that is why it was executed so well action was great and cgi was outstandingoverall a great comeback from dc,fantasy
nicole kidman was gorgeousmera was stunning even her wet look she still looks fabulousit was fun pure fun i would sayjames wan is the mani love king orm,fantasy
a must watch movie of 2018 i would recommend personal to go and watch it it was so interesting the story till the end,fantasy
comic based superhero movies are like making a movie out of stories from epics of indiaramayanam  mahabaratham most of the people already knows the story the movies success will be based on the way it is presented i noticed one key point for the success of these superhero movies tell the story from the beginning deliver it slowly say it like you tell to a kid during hisher bed time most of the successful superhero movies are falling under this line batman triology mcu avengers universe man of steel wonder woman all succeeded because they told the story from the start and they told it slowly if they decided to hurry things up then the result will end up like batman vs superman  justice league thankfully famous horror film director james wan made it slow and had patience to tell the story from the start is not so well known character for indian audience unlike ironman  batman atleast for me i dont know much i just know he is a member of justice league king of underwater universe called atlantis he can control water and he talks to fish what is his origin how he became the king of atlantis what is his power and weakness his emotions his family everything is explained clearly in this movie as str said in vinnaithaandi varuvaya avaru epadi ithukulla vantharu avaru epadi don aagi billa aguraru thats what the is all aboutvisuals graphics and locations gives a pleasant watching experience this is the main plus point of this movie throughout the movie we can witness the eye pleasing experience specially with the 3d glasses on be it an isolated light house underwater shots sahra desert a village in italy fantasy worlds beneath water everything was captured excellently it was like seeing the dreams without even sleepingslow paced screenplay and telling the story from the start can be considered as both pro and con of this movie though we get to know the character very well the movie feels lengthy and without much twists and turns so most of the scenes are predictable background score gives life to the visuals bgms are good in all scenessimilarities between this movie and thor are really surprising be it the fantasy world the story and the characters this movie reminds us of mcus thor in many scenes the scope and screenspace given to female characters in this movie are something what indian directors should learn from so summing it up with its bed time tale kind of story is a visual experience to be enjoyed in theatre oncerating 3255,fantasy
i am not really much of a fan of comic book movies apart from the dark knight trilogy by christopher nolan but i really enjoyed watching for what it is it is not the best movie ever made but it is very entertaining and i never got bored by the running time alsokudos to james wan who created a mesmerizing world for atlantis the visuals are really spectacular some of the best i have ever seen on screen and you really must watch this movie in a cinema to appreciate the art behind it as i already said the direction never feels too slow or boring even thought there is nothing new to the plot it is effective in its simplicity and i was entertained throughout the whole movie the performances by the actors are good especially by jason mamoa who portrays effectivelymy only minor issue with this movie is the script which i found a bit weak and cheesy although i do not mind some humor in certain scenes i felt that they went a bit over the top with some dialogue and it was distracting for my likingall in all this is a very entertaining movie with really impeccable visuals and great action sequences it is the perfect movie for christmas as many generations of movie goers will surely enjoy,fantasy
 delivers on all fronts the story isnt too farfetched the action sequences are superb and the actors themselves are great could argue the length of the film is a bit too long and i wouldve liked to have seen more of dolph lungdrens character,fantasy
 is definitely in the top 3 dceu movies in my opinion the one on one action scenes in it are by far the most entertaining in all superhero movies and the films biggest strength it is a big improvement over the previous dceu films like justice league and wonder woman with good fight choreography and vibrant power sets of the atlanteans its cinematography is also one of its better part of the movie as it doesnt shy away from using different locations and also it embraces its comic booky feel of it which makes the whole film a treat to the eyes james wan and this movies crew knew that every comic book movie doesnt have to have dim lighting and edgy or gritty feel to it in my opinion this is what hurt the other dceu films excluding wonder woman just being gritty and edgy just for the sake of it made them pretentious instead of embracing their comic booky feel to it the visuals and cgi are way better than justice league even though budget is like half of it albeit overused of cgi at times as for the cast most of them done a decent to good job with the material given to them especially willem dafoe nicole kidman and jason momoa although jason momoas portrayal of doesnt always remind me of comic book he does seem to enjoy being him and delivers a very entertaining version of as for the fictional land atlantis they did a great job on the world building of it by showing us various mysterious sea creatures and different parts of atlantis with its stunning visuals and use of colours ive seen lots of people comparing it to wakanda but personally i dont think its a fair comparison as atlantis is more fantasical and wakanda is more realistic and cultural moving on as for this movies cons the major flaw is definitely the script most of the time when they speak its usually awkward and cheesy or they dont feel like real person communicating and also too many exposition scenes and not enough genuine bonding moments between the characters this is why i dont really buy the romance between arthur and mera as they dont have enough time or moments to build their chemistry humour of this movie is also pretty weak only one or two jokes that genuinely made me and the people in my theater laugh the song choices and timing of them felt pretty out of place and weird too lastly the villains of this film couldve been way better both orm and black manta have justifiable reasons for their actions but they lack of sufficient character development and screening time by focusing 2 villains in the same film i think it couldve benefit both of them if they just focus on 1 villain and leave the other for its sequel afterall although there are numerous flaws it may not be the best film in the franchise but is by far the most entertaining dceu film to date with its stunning action scenes after justice league ive lost hope for this franchise but after this film it made me hyped for the future projects of the dceuoverall 810,fantasy
greetings fellow moviegoersi have watched every dceu movie hoping for something great but was disappointed over and over again batman vs superman was decent wonder woman was extremely cheesy and unoriginal suicide squad waswellsuicide squad and justice league shouldve just been called man of steel vs cgizilla butwow what a great film the visuals are amazing the action scenes are mindblowing and jason momoa is superb as sure the plot is a little thinpredictable but that doesnt take away the fact that this movie is a bold and very enjoyable step forward for the dceujames wan did an amazing job in visualizing atlantis and finally embracing the sillier side of the dc superheroes rather that trying to cover it up with a ton of rain and broodiness910,fantasy
ok i get the hype and i like the action part of the moviecgi was greatbut a lot of kliches fully predictable and finaly and extremly importan to me i like superheroe movies that are connected in a universe with other superheroes to be very carefull with what they present especially in a universe where superman exist and you know if he gets involve things go bad for the bad guys first of all didnt the atlantians know about the existans of superman how would they rage war on surface if a guy can come and kill their king in 2 seconds when the atlantians attack surface warning and obviously a couple of thousand people where kill the justice league just said ok has this no worries atleast in the other movies their was no justice league or superman didnt exist i can understand if the movie didnt involve surface to contain the movie around but from the moment that the world is in danger you would expect master of the seas getting a batstar and superman wiping the floor with his face i cant get over these plotholes in a movie like this with a budget of 160 mil and other movies to be made that are connected to that universe with similar budgets and not one person thinking ok lets not f the story and try to be logical here finally if batman knew about the guy that came from outerspace he knew about the fish people toosame goes for superman marvel did a prety good job with that and before so did dcnow you can expect darkseid coming in a batman solo movie and a lot of close ups a lot and with unrelatable soundtrack ,fantasy
better movie than following mcu movies thor thor 2 thor ragnarok spiderman homecoming doctor strange antman yet some of the above mentioned mcu movies have better metacritic score  bias against dc  thats it  anyway  imo this was the best dc movie  even better than ww tho i didnt like last few minutes of both movies too much cgi  vs black manta  meera vs atlantian soldiers scene was the best scene of the movie  jason momoa and amber heard are badass combo better villian than black panther but i loved panther fighting scenes more because those looked more real  this movie on the other hand is 95 percent cgi and i just hated that fighting sequence against that monster was going to give 810 but nicole kidman stole the show at the end  her 34 scenes are perhaps the best part of the movie  1 extra mark for her  background score was okish but better than justice league but comes no way close to ww and bvsoverall  a solid comeback from dc  100 times better movie than justice league  well done dc looking forward to shazam next yr ,fantasy
 a character i went in only knowing very little most of which coming from dc justice leaguegoing in i wasnt as hyped as i usually am for a comic book action movie but i have to say what a beautiful film it was the scenes in atlantis were just breathtaking and the costumes were great first act sets up everything i need to know about and where this story is going some of the comedy beats in this film just didnt work for me personally and tho his suit looked awesome black manta just wasnt as exciting as a future villain his hate for is understandable but seems like a very underwhelming villain for now im sure hell improve come the sequel the final act was just as great bar a few scenes and they all lived happily ever afterlooking forward to what dc has to offer in the future this was a great first step in the right direction,fantasy

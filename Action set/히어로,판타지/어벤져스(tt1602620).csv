i have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of the best adventure movies ive ever seen its almost impossible to convey how pumped i am now that ive seen it i purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high nothing seems to be able to reach them i usually avoid the hype train whenever possible that said i was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train it couldnt be helped so i was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good im so happy to report just the opposite has happenedthe only word i can think of to describe this movie is awesome its amazing work and everything i had hoped for and more its exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure it has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see one of the many things i loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members its not a two dimensional team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho most dont like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played that is great because so many of these characters are larger than life they have egos and the big guns arent used to working with other people or even playing by the rules stark thor and banner all work the other side of the fence so to speak then theres the widow hawkeye and captain america who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure they are all thrown together in a wonderful and best of all believable fashion again more than i ever dreamed possiblethe entire cast really delivered you needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts the pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances look i was missing ed norton as much as anyone on that hype train i talked about but im so happy to say that mark ruffalo won me over i hope hes locked up for the long haul because we dont need any more changes three was the lucky number for movie banners every other actor in avnegers that weve seen before is better than their previous incarnation every single one with the possible exception of rdj as stark hes great but its hard to top his take on the character from the original iron man in an ensemble movie i also have to fully disclose that im insanely attracted to scarlett johansson i thought her widow character was amazing but im definitely judging that through rose colored glasses the character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a transformers type popcorn scarfdowni honestly dont want to give away any of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled its how i saw the movie apart from what the trailers showed and even though youre obviously reading this review read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever experience the awesomeness for yourself as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force im just going to say hulk  thor combination equals awesome and leave it at that this movie defines must see,fantasy
if youre a fan of epic adventure movies then this is your dream come true this is the type of film you fantasized about growing up it really is the ultimate superhero mashup and its done perfectly the makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide that right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012 the depth of this movie really did surprise me even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise i was expecting a wild popcorn movie i was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film i couldnt be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully sure theres the popcorn fun we were all expecting but theres also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well its truly a stupendous movie regardless of genremarvel did it they pulled off the culmination of a master plan thats been taking shape for years they deliver a movie the likes of which weve never seen before and as good of a film thats ever been made in its genretheres a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now how do you fully flesh out care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun crisp and coherent story its extremely difficult to navigate that edgeofyourseat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles one of the most impressive aspects of the is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shinei loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together that could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but its treated just right its also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if youve never seen them before sure the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films youll still know and care about them in this movieits also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be this truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime the fanboy version of gone with the wind circa 1939 if you will and it all shows up on screen everything looks great and feels epic the equipment love that helicarrier the relationships the stars the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be there are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream badass and mean itim serious when i say that the big explosive moments are as grand as they should be but its the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level at this point weve all seen how good some cg action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good thats the ace up the sleeve this is not some cgi video game movie cut out the action and id still want to see this movie so its safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for noncomic book and comic book fans alike thats is the greatest power the ability to entertain all comers,fantasy
 assemble the is a truly enjoyable superhero film that lives up to its hype and creates a story that allows for four of the greatest superheroes to connect in this megablockbuster extravaganza joss whedon has created one of the most actionpacked marvel films to have graced the screen full of humour thrills and a great cast of characters all of which impel this visual effectsdriven spectacle whilst i had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3d the film is equally as stunning on an average television set with the final battle between the and lokis army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie an impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from whedon,fantasy
have movies become so bad these days that a merely wellexecuted totally formulaic film like the is heralded as an exceptional filmsure this film hits all the marks and has some good oneliners but once we expected films to be refreshing and new star wars while having obvious flaws provided us a totally new universe with its own unique political conflicts worlds and even its own theology the force its first twentyminutes is mostly watching the story of a robotic english dandy c3p0 argue with a chirping rolling trashcan r2d2 but amazingly enough lucas made that unique and crazy idea entertaining the plot of the is just your runofthemill comic book storyline compare its plot to that of inception or the matrix or even back to the future or the good the bad and the ugly much of what makes those films so great is that their plots are highly innovative you have no idea where they are going you always know exactly where the is going along these same lines psycho the empire strikes back the matrix etc provide classic twistsnorman has gone insane and has in his mind become his mother the films apparent killer darth vader the films main villain is revealed to be lukes father the first half of the matrix turns out to have transpired in a totally false reality nobody expected these twists what unexpected occurs in the even its minor twists have appeared in other recent films its most significantloki allowing his own capturecomes straight from the dark knightgangster films before the godfather were just pulp the godfather transcended the genre just as unforgiven did with westerns the same is true about the dark knight the doesnt transcend it regurgitates a donetodeath plot unlike the the dark knight was more than a comic book film it was entertaining compelling yet it explored complex moral ideas and its plot went in innovative directions did anyone know that the dark knight would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the joker and batman for harvey dents soul a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the joker or batman really won in the end a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be and did anyone not know that the would end with a huge battle with the ultimately triumphant uncertainty about how a plot will be resolved is what once kept the audience hooked not the continual spectacle of fights and explosions in fact look at the imdb top 250 with how many of these films would you know exactly how theyd end if you were seeing them for the first time in fact apart from the cartoons is there a single entry as totally formulaic as the is and lets not forget did you ever worry that any of the would not survive if not then where was the real dramatic tension one of the things that made the dark knight so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed and did anyone expect what happened to rachel dawes harvey dents girlfriend one of the things that made psycho so dramatic is its main protagonist dies halfway through the film great filmsserious or funmust make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake and do i even have to go into how voting to give the a 10 places it on par with the alltime great works of film artone flew over the cuckoos nest schindlers list taxi driver apocalypse now citizen kane vertigo crimes and misdemeanors 8 12 manhattan cinema paradiso etc a vote of 10 for a film like this diminishes the worth of these works of art that explore the deepest issues concerning the human conditionthough ive brought up some films that are darker than the or more serious that is not my complaint about the at all star wars  the empire strikes back back to the future the good the bad and the ugly were fun movies but they also had plots that went in unexpected directions had surprising twists introduced us to unique characters the elements ive listed here are what make a film exceptional and deserving of an incredibly high rating just a welldone totally formulaic movie like the simply does not deserve the praise it is getting of course this film does not deserve a 1 out of 10 i would really give it 3 or maybe 3 12 out of 5 stars which is equivalent to a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the imdb rating scale however until others dont alter their votes to put the more in line with where it should be in comparison to other great entertaining films of history my vote will remain a 1 go watch the a few more times once youve gotten used to the 3d the special effects the digital surround sound youll see that the film is predictable the jokes are soso and the violence of the fights and of the long climactic end battle actually gets kind of boringif youre a teenager still reading comics or a lover of comic books whos always dreamed of watching hulk fight thor thor fight iron man then this movie is what youve always been waiting for but for the rest of us the is not the tour de force its been made out to be oh wait a sec i just learned that theres a movie based on battleshipyou know that dull board game for eightyearolds i guess movies really are that bad if you compare the only to garbage like that i guess it really does seem greatnever mind,fantasy
the brings together a group of extremely talented actors and epic superheroes to create an action packed movie with hilarious banter laced into countless scenes superhero movies give actors a chance to play new characters with personalities they have never portrayed before chris evans is the extremely passionate and kind hearted captain america while robert downey jr is the tougher and sassier iron man the film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them together the villain loki laufeyson played by tom hiddleston even shows his weak spots and is almost seen as part of the team the actors have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen and they make man tights and capes look more fashionable than ever the majority of the film is done by special effects made by an amazing team they transform new york city into a place for heroes placing tony starks towering house in the middle of the city even at the end of the film the unsuspecting tony stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else this is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertained while having your feeling played with at the same time,fantasy
la review of the no spoilersi was lucky enough to attend the marvel screening of the on saturday morning in century city ca this was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before its release date just minutes before the movie started we were all surprised when writerdirector joss whedon walked in with kevin feige to introduced their little justice league movie not only did we all laugh but some booed lol if that wasnt enough of a surprise the soft spoken whedon introduced on stage chris hemsworth thor tom hiddleston loki clark gregg agent coulson and cobie smulders agent maria hill wow is she stunning in person the audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers this explained why the secret service like security were searching wanding everyone no cameras cell phones nothing was allowed in what a nice surprise for an early saturday morning screening ive never read comic books this is a comic book movie it was made for hardcore fans of comics and i appreciate the care joss whedon gives to this movie it was very entertaining to see tony stark iron man thor dr bruce banner hulk steve rogers captain america natasha romanoff black widow clint barton hawkeye agent maria hill agent phil coulson and director nick fury all interact with one another capt steve rogers was fighting in wwii just yesterday having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us the god of thunder thor is not from this world realm and doesnt understand modern technology on earth as well dr bruce banner has been on the run from the government practicing medicine in third world countries he hasnt been the hulk in two years whats his secret  tony stark is still the same playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology so how do you get them all to interact and play well together well director joss whedon is the secret to making it all work the highlight of the film for me is how joss whedon has all these characters interact deep character development was not needed for this film that is what the respective movies are for thor iron man the incredible hulk captain america the first avenger he does a great job of not forcing dialogue and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than i would have ever anticipated that is where whedon deserves the most credit he took what appears to be a very silly premise with silly looking characters and made it completely work seeing as the comics date back to the 1960s you can tell he not only did his homework but he really cares deeply for the material and his passion definitely shows on screen the movie is vastly entertaining the action scenes are amazing and satisfying nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences i felt as if there was not a single bad performance a couple of dialogue lines seemed off but once you remember who the character is and why they talk the way they do think of where they come from it all makes sense each respective character is true and honest to itself each of the characters brought their personality from their respective movie to the table it is by far the best marvel movie to dateso who was my personal favorite character from the movie dr bruce banner played by mark ruffalo of course he is by far the best bruce bannerhulk since bill bixby his intelligence genius is unparalleled greater than tony starks and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character as a kid growing up he was my favorite marvel super hero i enjoyed watching bill bixby play medical doctorphysicist dr david banner on television id watch terrified with my hands up to my face as he transformed into the raging green hulk yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist helping those in need when mark ruffalo was first announced to play bruce banner i didnt know what to think of it i knew that hes a good actor all he needs is the right director to get the needed onscreen character out of him i really hope they make an incredible hulk movie sequel starring mark ruffalo as dr bruce banner or at least i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel he was a natural fit for this role overall the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twentysomething terrible actors who were chosen for onscreen eye candy they all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great assembled they are unstoppable when i heard an movie was rumored to be in the works i was ecstatic the day has finally come go see it thrice 1010 stars,fantasy
after all the films leading to this one we were promised the on screen and this film gave us that big time this film sees a group of big personalities having to come together and defeat a mad man and his army from enslaving humanity one of the most important parts of the build up to this film was robert downey jnrs performance as tony starkiron man and he is just as awesome in this film his character grows in all these films but he is still the narcissist that we love also chris evans as captain america was really important as he is the leader and comes across as the moral compass of the whole film but he isnt boring which is great for the character the rest of the performances are great as well first of all is the recasting of mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk and he was the biggest surprise in this film he was great in both roles and the hulk has absolutely never been better then this film chris hemsworth is back as thor and this guy is absolutely seriously movie star and makes this character a great character full of personality scarlett johansson returns as black widow and she is sexy and tough while also proving that she is also the best female in these superhero films around samuel l jackson is back as nick fury and he is great as the character and squeezes the most he can out of this great character the one member of the team that isnt really developed is hawkeye he isnt really himself for the most of the movie but even then the last battle he becomes great what is important in a film like this is having a great villain and tom hiddlestone as loki definitely succeeds at that he is just so fun to watch and you buy that he could pull off all this destruction sometimes simplicity is best for a story and this is one of those times it has happened before that a group of combustible elements have to team up but this film gets the most out of it and adds real drama to the film the script is the best part of the film and the dialogue between the characters is what makes this film so enjoyable to watch because it makes all the characters feel unique and there own personalities the style of this film is great the action is all enjoyable and the film looks great but i have to mention the show stealer that is the incredible hulk this is the best interpretation of the hulk and he looks better then ever and he is possibly the best character in the film overall this is one of my favourite films ever and this is a comic book fans dream,fantasy
im sorry to say the isnt a good movie its a great  movie its not only the best team superhero movie ever made but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period  the is the culmination of what began in iron man and  continued through the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain  america it was only a few years ago that my son and i had just  finished watching iron man and as the credits were ending samuel l  jackson appeared on screen as nick fury and spoke to tony stark about  joining initiativein that short scene the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of alltime had begun   director joss whedon most known for the tv series buffy the vampire  slayer takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history the  iron mantony stark robert downey jr captain  americasteve rogers chris evans thor chris hemsworth hulkbruce  banner mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye  jeremy renner as assembled by nick fury whedons scripts usually  include clever banter gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and the is no different whedon has an utter love for comic  books and it is proudly put on display in the  the cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life  beginning with robert downey jr unlike iron man 2 in which downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene downey plays stark almost  effortlessly delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma charm and smugness to shine through robert downey jr is  tony stark chris evans solidifies himself in the role of captain  america he was very good in his solo film but truly owns the role  standing alongside iron man and thor chris hemsworths asgardian god  thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the films most funny moments after being seriously underutilized in  iron man 2 scarlett johanssons black widow is provided a backstory  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face shes as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically i could envision myself enjoying  a beatdown at the hands and feet of black widow the character i was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was jeremy renners hawkeye happily hes not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character  hawkeye stands alongside robin hood and katniss everdene the hunger  games as the best archers to grace the silver screen id like to see  more of him in a film of his own mark ruffalo the most recent choice  to play hulk is far better suited to the role than eric bana the  hulk and ed norton jr the incredible hulk ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene in the the hulk is at his most  impressive both in his onscreen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to hulk out if any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others for  me it was the hulk samuel l jacksons nick fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some and jackson slides quite easily into the role  clark greggs agent caulson returns and cobie smulders makes her  marvel films debut as agent maria hill and she is a welcome addition  the films main villain is thors adoptedbrother loki played by tom  hiddleston you would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters but  hiddleston does a fantastic job the performance should not go  unnoticed because its one of the strong points of the film loki is  not a villain without purpose and hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish  at a runningtime of 2 hours the is well paced and time  flies by the effects are topnotch the acting is very good and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths for viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films and if so why not were  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film but a story with reason thats backed up with incredible action  and humor   although the film is filled with larger than life characters none are  short changed each character is given at least one great scene to work  with and the opportunities dont go to waste the films finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking as usual  with marvel films be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence  which provides a surprising reveal  i went into the with unfairly high expectations due to all of  those that were involved as well as the films that came before it  after viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away i had set  myself up for disappointment it was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that i was put at ease and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away i never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen what i was watching im happy that marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did marvel studios and  disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film and  deservedly so because theres never been another movie made of its  caliber  grade a,fantasy
i was lucky enough to be included in the group to see the advanced screening in melbourne on the 15th of april 2012 and firstly i need to say a big thankyou to disney and marvel studiosnow the film how can i even begin to explain how i feel about this film it is as the title of this review says a comic book triumph i went into the film with very very high expectations and i was not disappointedseeing joss whedons direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect the script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor the special effects are literally mindblowing and the action scenes are both hardhitting and beautifully choreographedwhile all of these things script action special effects and so on and so forth are important its no good having them spot on if you dont have a cast that just isnt right but fortunately for fans and for the actors involved whedons cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and nightthe actors performances in marvels the are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings robert downey jr will have you in stitches scarlett johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations and tom hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fearall in all marvels the is a visual delight and i cannot wait to see it again and again and again marvel fans will not be disappointed and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedlythe assembled and aweinspiring ten out of ten,fantasy
saw the preview at the end of thor back in 2011 had to wait almost a year to experience the global phenomenon firsthand the theater experience wasnt something to forgetall in all the title of this review says it all marvels the is quite possibly the greatest superhero movie in history the combination of hardcore assassins widow and hawkeye reclusive banner arrogant iron man leader cap and the norse brothers thor and loki mixes itself together into a concoction of personalities and superpowers which guarantees to impressmarvel has set the bar high for themselves since its release only a select few superhero movies have compared to it and all of them have been marvel,fantasy
knowing a little bit about comic books and knowing some about assemble it made this film the directed by joss whedon even more enjoyable for mewhen earth comes under attack by asgardian loki tom hiddleston in his pursuit to get the tesseract it is up to shield to pull start up the after a small town is almost completely destroyed by thor on a previous visit to earth shield decided that they needed something that could take on anything that was not from this world so when nick fury calls on some of the biggest heroes earth has ever met iron man robert downey jr hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarelett johansson the hulk mark ruffalo captain america chris evans and of course thor chris hemsworththe theme of this movie in my opinion would be man vs man this is because throughout the entire film there is some sort of conflict going on the first and main conflict that appears is loki attacking shield takes control of hawkeye and dr selvig in order to steal the tesseract and use it for his own purposes a second conflict that appears in the film is between thor and loki when thor still considers them brothers loki retaliates and says that he is not really his brother and that he should still be the true ruler of asgardwith the costumes that have been chosen for this film it helps to create the aspect of the heroes being more than a normal human even with hawkeye and black widow black widow had been trained pretty much from birth to become a killer and hawkeye has advance skills in marksmanship with thors costume he is wearing something that helps to prove that he is not from earth and from another world now for iron man he made his own super suit that could do almost anything which includes keeping him safe from being torn up from the roaders on the ship that shield was functioning from after an attack from loki and his minionsfinally in the final attack with loki and the thor takes loki back to asgard to deal with his faults there where the intention is for him to be properly punishedthis is a must see film especially if you are a comic book junkie,fantasy
i think any viewer buying a ticket for this film is aware of what he expects to see on the screen recently the film industry has been criticized for the abundance of projects of a purely entertaining nature including the however if you look closely  it turns out that there is not so much really good and quality entertainment cinema some films are boring some are bluntly stupid and for the most part it turns out that entertainment can be called only a few luxuriously shot scenes and at other times the viewer is forced to entertain himself with popcorn and cold cola so the is a completely different caseim not a fan of comic books and the attitude towards this genre is rather negative because of its total zashtamovannosti and uncompromising pathos however seeing such a spectacle as the its hard not to leave your sarcasm aside and fully enjoy the proposed attraction director joss weedon in the beginning caused me to distrust in spite of the mass of laudatory reviews his mission serenity did not impress me at all however in this case a clear and confident direction is felt throughout the film weedon is also responsible for the script and here i want to note how competently it is worked out to fill the picture with action to the eye not forgetting about the meaningfulness and clear drawing of the characters characters it is a balanced scenario that makes the film look in one go and the characters look so charismatic as necessary for a positive perception of the pictureundoubtedly marvell approached the project very seriously presenting torah and first avenger last year these films being technically quite successful in themselves at the same time became an effective prelude to the main movie event marvel and the creators did their best to make the film truly an event that surpassed its historical predecessors since almost all the characters are familiar to the viewer and the story itself is simple and understandable  it makes it possible to fill the picture with spectacular action to the point that it seems unbelievable how all this can fit into one film even if it lasts more than two hours at the same time this is not the case when the entire film is thrown at different locations trying to diversify the action in this way the bulk of events takes place on the ship nick fury and in new york but everything is done so qualitatively that not how much it tires the scene of the massacre in the city in the final is fascinating although the scene is not called the language because of its wide time frame for a very long time the heroes will fight the enemy everything will jump fly and explode and all this in an excellent highquality 3d and although the film is not without pathos i was pleased that the question of the police who are you to command here captain america did not begin to pronounce his name which the russian viewer perceives with his teeth but simply showed in deedof course there is a lot of humor in the film however if for example in the same sea battle creators used humor as a saving thread literally pulling the picture from the abyss in certain places in it is albeit an obligatory but an equal part of the overall structure which works in a complex this is not the option when you close your eyes to some flaws due to some pluses an abundance of humor for example because there are no obvious shortcomings in all parameters of the production of the film and the humor itself  yes sometimes even stiff and sarcastic chuckling over the heroes and reducing the extra degrees of pathos in this regard it is not superfluous to mention that joss weedon also had a hand in creating the scenario huts in the forest but here of course everything is in a softer frameworkto say that is a typical entertaining movie would be fundamentally wrong  in fact marvel was removed practically by the standard representative of the genre which uses every minute of its timing as effectively as possible mass of spectacular action magnificent picture in highquality 3d wonderful soundtrack sarcastic humor and nice characters it is this film that should be considered a grandiose opening of the summer season of blockbusters as it really sets a very high level,fantasy
this remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations ive been waiting for this movie since sam jacksons character uttered those famous words after the first iron man film stark now knows hes not the only superhero in his world and its as big a treat for our real world as it gets seeing the avenger initiative in action is as great as i would ever have hoped hell who am i kidding ive been waiting to see this movie all my life who wouldve thought years ago that all these characters could fit in to a film and all of them be done justice it delivers greatness from scene one and has to be considered the best this genre has ever produced truthfully as good as some of the previous work has been from every studio nothing else has come close thats not hyperbole i really think most will agree if they see it with an open mind i loved this movies depth heart humor gravitas action performances emotion and payoff i honestly cant wait to see it again with the rest of the world later right now im simply basking in the greatness i just witnessed,fantasy
after watching the film today i decided to review this film because i am literally on the edge of my seat for the sequel and every time i wake up for university or for work i view all three trailers and get even more excited and emotional for the filmi watched the film on 04272012 when it was released in scotland and for me to see all the heroes and supporting characters brought in from their respective films together into one film was dream come true for me i always hoped for a justice league film consisting of batman superman wonder woman green lantern john stewart the flash hawkgirl  jonn jonzz but i have to admit that dc are rushing things for their cinematic universe from the introduction to each hero to their developing relationships to the funny moments between each character and to the amazing visual affects there is not a dull moment in this film the is fantastic we know who the characters are and their origins developed from the preceding films  iron man 2008 the incredible hulk 2008 iron man 2 2010 thor 2011  captain america the first avenger 2011 seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen was extremely fun and boisterous many fans of the superhero genre want a balance of fighting explosions as well as intelligent scenes and joss whedon and zack penn do just that with their vision and imagination the scenes are entertaining and hilarious especially when the characters are interacting with one another during the film such as captain america meeting iron man after the confrontation with loki iron man mocking captain america and thor the chemistry with bruce banner is poetic in the shield helicarrier conference room and finally the scene between thor and the hulk is hilarious especially when thor is sucker punched by the hulk also the scene when iron man thrusts the energy onto the shield of steve rogers to annihilate a chitauri fleet foreshadows events in captain america 3 or better now known as captain america civil war in addition its a shame that edward norton didnt return as bruce bannerhulk but mark ruffalo nailed the scenes in his first film in the role bequeathed to him by the former ruffalo portrays banner in a phlegmatic manner managing to control his impeccable rage only to easily let it out when in the hulk mode his performance is amazing the best part of the movie for me would have to be the moment when tony stark as iron man introduces himself as a team player near the climax  after being lambasted by steve rogerscaptain america earlier  when he intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the chitauri fleet destroying the mother ship however the stars of the film for me would have to be robert downey jr and tom hiddleston both actors are superb in their roles as iron man and loki respectivelymarvel and dc both have a variety of rich characters and even a brilliant number of story lines however in my eyes marvel will always be number one because they have implemented their films with careful planning and precision in the end when it comes to marvel cinematic films you will crave for more because of its awesomeness and we all know for a fact that marvel will up their game and will always deliver for their loyal fan base,fantasy
i just saw the early screening for san diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them and suffice to say i am glad i was privileged enough tofirst off this hands down is the best marvel movie ever i dont say that lightly and in terms of superhero movie with maybe the nolan batman series being tied with this i thought whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie i especially like what was done with hawkeye and black widow just because those two didnt really have their individual movie with their back story you can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film going into the film i honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly iron man and captain america but whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like wow this guychick is a badass for every mutant i will admit i am not a hulk fan i like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films show or comic but hulks role in the movie is so awesome i became a fan just from it if any of you are whedon fans then you guysgirls will love this movie it has his mo written all over the humor and story presentation and there were definitely parts in the movie where i thought wow this seems like firefly and serenity and story aside if you read watched or idolized marvel superheros as a kid the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining the or xmen all together on the screen kicking ass in summation i dont need to say you need to watch this movie because i think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this all this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie i dont say this much but job well done marvel and disney for hiring a writerdirector who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of marvel comics being a success and in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in general that is very hard to do cheers joss whedon,fantasy
the is the first team up movie for the mcu combining iron man captain america and thor alongside with black widow hawkeye nick fury and of course the hulk to fight the maniacal and oddly comical in all the best ways loki brother of thor and part frost giant and this movie is everything you could ever think you would want in a super hero collaboration film joss whedon wrote and directed this film to perfection with the team up of everyone being seamless and interesting with various conflicts throughout and the almost certain that they could never work together ever until the end each character feels used amazingly with comedy being brought in perfectly drama at the perfect times and a whole hell of a lot of action in this 143 minute film with expanding on a lot of the small quirks of each character and the nail biting tension throughout the film done by the fantastic direction and great feel of this film joss whedon put in all he could ever do in this film and executed it perfectly the writing by whedon is also flawless when i first saw this film in 2012 i honestly thought these actors were real with how fluent and smooth their dialogue was combined with the a acting done too by each and every cast member even the one scene actors shown throughout not a single actor had any opinion in the writing of the film and with solely whedon writing it you can see how well of a writer he is and how smooth he can make the conversations in this film especially my favorite parts of the dialogue are the small on going jokes throughout the film with each character it brings the light out of some of the darkest scenes and can make each and everyone as memorable as possible i remember quoting this film like it was a religious text or something with how well written it is the acting is once again perfect robert downey jr plays once again a flawless tony stark with either his smooth and slick execution of every line to him hiding snacks throughout the sets to add to his quirky character that the audience has grown to love and appreciate in the film new comer mark ruffalo in the mcu also kills it as bruce bannerhulk with his uneasy performance and social awkwardness too everyone else chris hemsworth chris evans scarlett johansson jeremy renner samuel l jackson also do amazingly with their roles with a smooth balance of comedy and seriousness in each of their scenes the casting in this series is still flawless and i dont want to change a single cast member with their respective roles the is a fantastic movie that will be put down in history as one of the best superhero movies to ever exist and should deserve its popularity and praise for its technical accomplishment and storytelling milestone the gets a 1010,fantasy
im happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way its not that anyone needs to see those other avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development this also allows them to probe deeper into the characters personalities this heightens the tension so often missing from comicbook movies and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing the result is a film thats just flat out exceptionalof course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly what i loved is that marvel did it again with their main villain loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie spurned loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption he always keep people guessing and again thats just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief he has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity you have somebody whos capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and tom hiddleston plays it like the master he has become this is oscar worthy villain performance goodthe performances in this movie are as good as any ive ever seen in an adventure film the great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis the rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other each of these great actors have such specific talents that its fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie i think whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths its just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event,fantasy
each plot of the movie make us curious of what comes next the direct know how to manage every superheroes and villains in balance all of them has unique strange we keep wondering how iron man look so cool and why captain america is a serious patriot the effect and cgi are also outstanding and as usual marvel will give so many easter eggs for geeks to find out the success of this movie come up when iron man franchise along with captain america the first avenger and thor released previous years the avenger can be main contender for best superheroes movies against dcs dark knight rise though i prefer marvel movies i suggest all marvelsuperheroes movies lover to watch this movie period,fantasy
i just loved marvels i thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered this movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions i dont remember when i enjoyed a movie this much such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character i enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different seeing them blend together in and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat example they blended the grounded futurist tony stark with the norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way same could be said for every other character it all works in fact it doesnt just fit its a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great its why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment things like transformers gi joe and even star trek all operate with monotone restrictions covers all angles and delivers depth with its funi havent enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever,fantasy
ever since the beginning of the film i was so amazed and happy that i was at the premier of the movie very good acting from all the main characters and good acting from the rest great directing and writing from joss whedon too the cinematography was stunning throughout the whole filmthis is a fun action packed film for the whole family to enjoy just like the rest of the marvel movies but better the special effects by far are the best for any marvel movie the hulk looks so much more real by the way the hulk made the movie even better also do not see the in 3d see the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies it has a lot of humor and love so again see it,fantasy

im not going to spoil anything or get very technical here i dont usually write reviews i did so because this movie took me back to my childhood like no other movie didsure its not intellectually pretentious or groundbreaking from a cinematic or storytelling point of view but it delivers perfectlythe wit conflict adventure heart and sense of wonder that i once found in my crazy uncles attic slumbering inside those weird looking and dusty marvel magazines  populated with supersoldiers handsome flying scientists norse gods green monsters and incredibly hot chicks in black leather  are hereas i grew up i somehow repressed the idea that there was no such thing as fictional happiness these characters will never exist and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about but this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls party nights collegetaxes and other complicated serious things came along as the movie ended i felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as i knew it in my young adult lifei watched this with my 10 year old nephew i dont know if that makes me the crazy uncle but it sure was great to be back in that attic even for a while i always knew hulk smashed now i know he always will,fantasy
there is no way this is legit 88 the movie is comparable to transformers 3rated a 6look i loved the following recent action hero movies spiderman 13 dark knight super 8 iron man12 transformers12i really dont dislike that many movies im not being cynical this movie really is just a cluster  theres no emotion to the whole thing its dull and flat it also feels very pgits the definition of clich when it comes to super hero movies theres no bar being raised there is nothing new being done the entire script is just a bunch of predictable non sense jargon with no meaning theres no event in the movie where i go wow that is original or go wow this movie gives me emotion and it really immerses me in the experiencewatch the beginning of star trekmy only thoughts is that walt disney pictures did black hat tactics to hype this movie through social networks i cannot and will not believe people think this movie is worth an 88i really did want to walk out of the theater this movie is forgettable and i was very disappointed and let down this movie really just feels like another average super hero movie but the expectation of it being good just makes it worse,fantasy
the movie must be a dream come true to everyone seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen while the heroes stand alone films doesnt have that enough action this movie executes more of their super abilities its really fun and exciting a lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes this is what all fans and moviegoers want in more fighting more explosions more smashing and more fun in the end you will crave for more because of its awesomeness the is simply marvelousour modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense bland characters and too long runtime the runtime here is long but its necessary the storytelling is quite simple as it gets we already knew who these characters are the best part is when they develop their relationship to each other this happened mostly in the second act these scenes are funny and entertaining its more entertaining when theres robert downey jr stealing the show of course he will always be like this his chemistry with bruce banner is wonderful two geniuses working together other than that the rest of the performances were also good chris hemsworth is just mighty enough as thor and chris evans is cool enough as captain america scarlett johansson is probably the weak link here shes still sexy thoughmaybe the only problem here is the secondary villains they are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for hulk to smash them but it doesnt matter because theres loki stealing all of his scenes once again tom hiddleston is simply fantastic as loki the action is pretty awesome its suppose to be awesome the hulk nails it in these scenes its exciting to see him smash stuff with glory while theres iron man flying thor wielding his hammer captain america throwing his shield and hawkeye shooting with his archer more explosions just what everyone wants its fantastically cool and funthere are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions the film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them its a rare kind of blockbuster these days it has clever humor awesome action and really fun characters it makes the fans and moviegoers happy and amazed this is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch this film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer though i still think the first iron man movie is the best of this set but still this is a big fun experience you will have in the big screen,fantasy
i initially had a feeling that this movie would be a too much superhero overload for my taste but then i saw the positive reviews on imdb and rottentomatoes and also the comments youtube etc and i felt i had been wrong and they might have pulled it off really well so i went to watch itbut i felt completely cheated after watching this film how could imdb ratings be so misleading the only reason this film might be remembered could be because it would become part of the case study how a below average film could be made into blockbuster by hyping it up on internet and social networks i dont write reviews in general but forced to do it for this film such a a letdown and waste of time even though its got one of the best ever ratings on imdbif imdb rating is actually true i feel worried for the people who cant see through the actions and special effectsoverall you might enjoy this film if you have enjoyed micheal bays transformers if you didnt you might find it very difficult to sit through this movie as well,fantasy
this is the best superhero movie i have ever seen full stop but did you actually read that did you get it this is the best superhero movie i have ever seenit is about superheroes and it is made with todays technology todays technology allows movie makers to design scenes that were technologically impossible before any other previous superhero movie i have seen was worseif you never got into superhero comics then this is not a movie for younow back to the summary line some sorry idiotic reviewers are comparing this movie to memento blade runner psycho the empire strikes back the matrix etc and talking about lack of symbolism depth twists etc this movie doesnt deserve this high rating etc are you people on drugspossible explanations for these 1 star punisher reviews are 1 some people just love to hate or 2 they had a bad day or 3 they want to show off their expert knowledge of le cinema or 4 they were simply on drugs while watching this movieso bad news guys this movie does not have the hyperrealism of the bicycle thief the supreme intrigue of citizen kane the old fashion romance of casablanca or the sublime dialogs of 12 angry men this is only the best superhero movie i have ever seeni am 50 i have an engineering degree my favorite pastime is movies my favorite genre is scifi my favorite movie is blade runner and this is still the best superhero comic book adaptation i have ever seen sorry for shouting and this is why in my review this movie deserves a 9 not 10 because it is not artif you want to see an artsy movie check out the bicycle thief and take some antidepressants with you if you want to see what a real superhero would do see chronicle highly recommendedif you want to see a good comic book adaptation you cannot do any better than this movie,fantasy
film studios just found out that a lot of moviegoers rely on reviews like internet buyers rely on customer reviews it is known that many big internet shops hire reviewagencies those only job it is to fake authentic looking customer reviews because a lot of buyers trust the reviews of other customers more than any magazine reviewsthats what is happening here 80 of the reviews here are written by professional reviewagencies which got paid by the studios if you look closer and compare the text of those best movie ever reviews or variations of that such as i did not expect much i am not a superhero fan but this was greatest beyond belief  with reviews written at other moviegoer platforms you will find a lot of equal phrases and text blocksi guess that imdb is aware of that cheating and they support it this movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula superheros need super problems to solve so that they can shine each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to hisher individual super powers they only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team but suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread as you can guess and only towards the end they find together again and etc etc a story for retarded eightyearolds flavored with as much cgi as you little brain can swallow in the timea stupid movie with a stupid story stupid characters with stupid attitudes stupid cgi and a stupid ending if super stupid means blockbuster then here you go,fantasy
terrible complete trash brainless tripe insulting to anyone who isnt an 8 year old fan boy im actually pretty disgusted that this movie is making the money it is  what does it say about the people who brainlessly hand over the hard earned cash to be entertained in this fashion and then come here to leave a positive 88 review oh yes they are morons its the only sensible conclusion to draw how anyone can rate this movie amongst the pantheon of great titles is beyond meso trying to find something constructive to say about this title is hardi enjoyed iron man tony stark is an inspirational character in his own movies but here he is a pale shadow of thatabout the only hook this movie had into me was wondering when and if iron man would knock captain america outoh how i wished he had  what were these other characters anyways useless bickering idiots who really couldnt organise happy times in a brewery the film was a chaotic mish mash of action elements and failed set piecesi found the villain to be quite amusingand now i give up this movie is not robbing any more of my time but i felt i ought to contribute to restoring the obvious fake rating and reviews this movie has been getting on imdb,fantasy
heres why the fails so badly1 wrong wrong director  joss whedon is a tv director serenity worked because it was essentially a tv movie and he has here made the a tv movie bad move this should have gone to jj abrams bryan singer or brad bird2 dreadful miscasting  only robert downey junior can hold his head high chris evans is as wooden in this as the flat captain america film those playing thor hulk black widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed3 weak weak villain  tom hiddleston plays a slight camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles a spoiled teenager than anything else this film needed a general zod4 too much obvious cgi  come on its 2012 theres no excuse for the george lucasy effects like the flying shield craft graphics5 no drama tension and a script so obviously flat that whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tonefor anyone growing up with marvel comics in the 70s chime with me on this we deserved so much more for younger audiences it will pass im surereally cant understand though the positive reviews am i alone in this ,fantasy
although marvel pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid if not spectacular thus far i certainly didnt expect jon faverau to deliver one of the best comicbook movies ever  iron man if it wasnt for dcs own billionaire playboy superhero wouldve champion iron man as the best flick in the genre yes i do rate iron man that highly spiderman 1  2 were good but didnt exactly capture the essence of peter parker while spiderman 3 was a huge mess not mark steven johnson mess but a mess nonetheless last years motion picture debuts of marvel staples thor and captain america were also very good very faithful to their respective source material joe johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the wolfman back to the silver screen whereas kenneth branaghs shakespeare sensitives proved a stroke of genius in fitting thor into marvels motion picture universe to be honest i even enjoyed 2008s the incredible hulk after ang lee damn near killed the franchiseeven though marvel pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on its own the hiring of joss whedon seemed like an odd choice of course joss whedon is the genius behind tvcult hits like buffy angel and firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005s serenity managing all those superstar egos handling multiple character arcs dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys  to be honest i wouldnt have entrusted him with a fraction of the 200millionplus budget for the thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in a single movie  bryan singer xmen  x2 and matthew vaughn xmen first class while brett ratner ruined xmen 3 with his unfocused direction at first i thought joss whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter considering that ratner had more filmmaking experience than whedon at the time of filming x3 but nothing could be further from the truth joss whedon is the master with a captial mlet me say it out loud joss whedon is a comic book movie god unlike ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie you think tony stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character you are wrong though robert downey jr is in top form as he always is when he dons the iron man suit the other characters are far from underdeveloped and dont crumble under the pressure of his largerthanlife persona if anything its the hulk that absolutely steals the show that said i think we have found the definitive bruce banner mark ruffalo he absolutely owns the role he is the hulk and we finally got the hulk we deserved everybody brings their agame and every character gets a fair amount of screen time i cant find any flaw in this movie of course the special effects are spectacular but its the dialogue that won me over really each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines  not just tony stark when you watch the make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully  ive never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie and ive watched my fair share joss whedon you are the freaking man they said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie  they were wrong from now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple largerthanlife figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza  yeah im slamming the last two transformers flicks i guarantee joss whedon wouldve done justice to the franchise after watching the everything that bears the name of joss whedon is a mustsee for me now final verdict 10 out of 10 this movie is iron man on steroids go watch that movie,fantasy
i dont want to waste more time talking about a movie that i just wasted 2 12 hours of my life watching but i feel its necessary in order to maybe save someone from making the same mistake i just did by watching this stinker actually i slept through some of it so there was some valuable time spent in the theater i would have walked out except my girlfriend look like she was enjoying it this movie just sucked plain and simple its the typical good guys have to save the earth from aliens it did have all the emotions thoughthe dialog was laughable and the acting made me want to cry unless you just like seeing buildings getting demolished and people who are impervious to bullets explosions and every kind of weapon known to man stay home and save your money ive watched better cartoons as a kid it actually angers me that there are so many people in this world the simply loved this movie this movie was so bad i may never go to the theater again,fantasy
believe me when i say that the was my most anticipated movie ever i mean come on a bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil that is just priceless and not any superheroes but the most wellknown and wellloved the movie has some of the best actors in hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created this movie has loads of captain america iron man thor hawkeye and needless to say hulk smash they were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and i give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome cool and really really fun i live in australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you americans this wait is is worth it when the movie was over most of the cinema clapped  this was the first time i had ever seen this ever at the movies even though it was 12 in the morning the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the 13 to watch itthe plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently loki previously seen in thor wants to wreak havoc on earth by letting a group of aliens enter earth through a portal its up to the to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them the fight scenes between the superheroes are just fcking awesome i was so excited to see thor and iron man battle it out  that scene was just plain epicthe music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action and trust me there is a lot of action the visual effects are also fantastic one of the best i have ever seen in a film and they will leave you in awe hulk along with iron man do a good job of adding humour into the film and all of the scenes with the hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing it is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where stark and loki have a confrontation we have an army  we have a hulk that scene was what did it for meif you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve so far it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time not really sure guess we have to wait for tdkr to come out 1010  perfect over and out 25 april 2012,fantasy
all i have to say is this is probably one of the best movies i have ever seen its funny action packed and the characters played there roles perfectly,fantasy
the is one of my favourite marvel movies from the mcu i have watched this movie like twice first time was on dvd and the second time was on channel 4 in the ukthe acting was goodthe camera movement was goodthe special effects were good overall i would check it outi wont spoil any plots or details,fantasy
the is a classic marvel movie full of action stunning special effects and the odd bit of funny humour i think age of ultron will be better but this is still a fun and enjoyable film i love how it appeals to everyone not just comic book fans i cant find any flaws in this movie  it kinda has everything you need in a good movieaction comedy cool quotes and stunning special effects i also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed the casting choices were also great everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play robert downey jr is great as iron man and scarlett johannson is amazing as black widow my favourite is samuel l jackson as the tough but amazing nick fury all in all watch this film,fantasy
when my friend asked me to see the with him i thought he meant the steed and mrs peel  unfortunately  it was the comic book  while i am not such a big superhero action movie fan  i did enjoy the batman and watchman movies  however the is one film i could have easily passed up  after first battling each other  the unite and join forces to save the world from the same common enemy  a lot of the action takes place on a gigantic flying aircraft carrier no64  not the cv64 uss constellation  this movie consists mostly of very fast paced cgis and cheesy iron man robert downey jr oneliners  our heroes and super villain are practically indestructible as they are beaten to a pulp but always manage to bounce back time after time  i dont know what the black widows super powers were except martial arts and pistol shooting  some unintentionally funny moments came when iron man downey was speaking from inside his metal suit  it looked like a talking head from inside a goldfish bowl  it just looked so silly  there isnt much chemistry between these cardboard characters either  if you are 10 years old or an adult with the maturity of a 14 year old boy  who is obsessed with reading comic books and are addicted to video games im sure the is your cup of tea  if not you will be thinking of the 143 boring minutes you just wasted or what other movies were playing next door you could have seen  if you do decide to see this movie  select a seat in the last row to avoid nausea  i would like to see movies that rely so much on cgis to be made into animated full length cartoons instead  at least the unaware movie goer has a better idea of what is in store for them when they purchase a ticket  this film was definitely not for me   not hot  pwh,fantasy
oh my god   the was a big disappointment to me  i cant believe how doll and bored i was during the 2 hours and 20 minutes playtime of the movie the directing was so bad and i think the director thinks the audience are so stupid or retarded to believe those cheap story lines or cheap jokes or even cheap plot  the script was so cheap and boring and the characters didnt blend with each other at all im not even impressed by the special effects of the movie  i think xmen 3 or spider man showed a lot more special effect than this one  i nearly enjoyed the last scene of the entire movie but this was not enough for such a movie who earned unbelievable high ratings finally when i knew that the director has never directed such super hero movies and he has only directed for the tv like buffy series i know why this movie sucked  still cant believe how it got 86 really ,fantasy
the wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long ever since we saw the preview that was attached to captain america heres what i thought of the movie when i caught the premiereyou get the best of joss whedon and that is quite a lot1 black widow is no longer just a piece of eyecandy did you seriously expect the creator of buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty she kicks ass and how yes and its about time2 for all the newbies out there that havent watched some or all of the previous movies the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out you get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended so its possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the diehard fans but the second half more than makes up for it also for what its worth isnt it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while before they get down to some serious action3 the postcredits scene oh my god there is no point whatsoever in going to watch the movie if you dont wait for it you simply have to see it 4 on a sidenote if youre relatively new to the marvel universe you must see the superhero squad show yes its a cartoon and no its not a very serious one either but looking past all that its a serious refresher course in everything marvel before the next movie in the marvel cinematic universe releases as it really helps you understand the characters i wouldnt have understood the importance of the post credits scene without it 5 the fight sequences the gist of which we all saw over and over again at comiccon finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie its not one until some oldfashioned kapow6 and yes there are many scenes which are a fanboys or girls most awesomeest dream come aliveyou also however get the worst of whedon which i admit i pretty much dreaded i wont say what it is as it will spoil it for you but its really very obvious if youve seen anything of buffy angel firefly serenity and dr horribles singalong blog my opinion may not however be accurate as some might argue that what weve seen is actually his best whatever the general consensus there is no doubt that whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the marvel verse  and his best is pretty darn goodif i simply have to find flaws in the movie the only one i can think of right now is that some important  antman wasp black panther and vision  are nowhere to be seen black widow was the only token female in this alltestosterone group so wasp would have been a welcome addition as the scales would not be so unbalancedthe works because underneath all the largerthanlife heroes with their huge egos their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable things do not just fall in place  everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory  they had to work hard to make it happen and that is this movies biggest uspallinall go watch the movie if not on the first day then at least some other time for as long as its on in the theaters your first glimpse of this movie just has to be on the big screen,fantasy
this is where imdb needs to react to all those obviously faked reviews if they dont people will just ignore all blockbusterreviews which would call for competition that will take action against this kind of manipulationthis has never been so obvious than with the this movie does not deserve a rating above 4 the plot is uninspired and boring has no twists and everyone knows where its going the dialog feels very scripted characters in comic books for 5yearolds maybe talk like that superheroes dont the acting is very unnatural it feels very staged and no emotion is being transported to the audience the characters arent developed they just get different punchlines to throw at the audience the cgi is really bad not worthy of a movie of 2012 i think even 2001  a space odyssey 1968 had better special effectsit seems that they spent almost all their money on the actors forgot about the story and just used the cheapest cgi they could get the rest of the money they used for marketing and creating a hype as i said this is obvious here on imdbthe whole thing is just cheap but we will see more of this if people continue to make this kind of movie profitable and this will probably be the case so expect more of these,fantasy
this film is is an empty shell covered with dazzling lights sure it does look pretty but that is as far as it goesnothing interesting happens in this film by interesting i mean plot wise not a standard fight scene with new people copied and pasted into it the plot is horrific to the point in which you wonder if there actually is a one hollywood seem to use the same script for every action film they make only they replace a few of the more minor details so hopefully people wont notice in an attempt to keep at least some of the male and select female audience awake the director decides it is time for scarlett johansson to pop up on screen to show off her lets say defining costume in such an obvious manner it is just a cheap cheap film full of filler material that you will enjoy if you have an inability to think for yourselfi really have no idea how this film got into the top 100 of all time there is really no reason for it to be there the only plus sides are that the acting and cast are superb it is just a shame that they were not involved in something where their talents could have been used in more fulfilling roles,fantasy
yep marvel has done it again but this time to the max you can rest assured that is an absolutely amazing movie im so glad marvel got in to the solo movie making business instead of leasing out their characters to other studios theyre making movies themselves and have not missed yet sony pooping on ghost rider again this very year is a great reminder of that is without a doubt their best effort yet personally i think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie really takes the comic book genre to the highest level they along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by marvelizing characters by making them more believable and more relatable spiderman and the xmen did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation nolan did this for batman and raimi for spiderman they pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd not down to them favreau branagh and johnston did similar good work for marvel leading up to this gem now joss whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work thats come before its like the ultimate team work and whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly like the great films of the past he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality the humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor yet all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good filmive said it before but its brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity its a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun this is without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012 quite possibly the best regardless of genre i dont see anything changing that for the rest of the year this movie is just that good,fantasy
what a disappointment although really not surprised at how bad it was a totally boring endless and mostly witless movie aimed at braindeadened people who think that special effects explosions and fantasy but definitely not fantastic characters make for a great movie the cinematography was gray and cloudy the editing incomprehensible and the acting unsurprising and depressingly familiar simple human emotions which used to be integral to a movie are now so rare noise and alltoofamiliar mayhem have been substituted the attention span of the audience when not being bombarded by yet another special effect shifts quickly to their cell phone when things slow down even a bit to think that moreofthesame will be the order of the day is depressing count me out,fantasy
the tesseract has awakened spoken in the opening scene picks right up where captain america the first avenger and thor left off sheild director nick fury samuel l jackson is forced to call upon earths mightiest heros to stop the self outcast asgardian lokiiron man thor captain america and the incredible hulk along with black widow and hawkeye are the only hope to save the world from an invasion and boy do they in an instant superhero classic possibly the best thing about the or assemble in the uk is that each hero has grounded powers the exception being thor unless you count hulks strength as a super power which makes the marvel heros more believable than their dc counterpartstheres drama action comedy and some amazing cgi and thankfully doesnt fall into the same category as the not so fantastic fantastic 4 movies mark ruffalo replacing the underwhelming ed norton excels as bruce bannerhulk which is without a doubt the best on screen version of the iconic hero after the awful 2003 hulk movie and 2008s slightly improved the incredible hulk as well as ruffalo and co star robert downey jr playing tony starkiron man for the 4th time having some fantastic chemistry in a scene onboard the hellcarrierchris evans plays captain america perfectly as the man out of time chris hemsworth is believable in his role as lokis brother like in thor scarlett johansson is the surprise of the movie though with a lot of the action revolving around her black widow the only major disappointment with the is that jeremy renners hawkeye is underused that being said every hero gets decent screen time to justify their appearance as well as everyone having a big part to play in the fantastic final sequencehowever the towers over every superhero movie in recent memory with the only real challengers being xmen and the dark knight trilogy joss whedons hit is sure to please marvel fans and the everyday movie goer next up for marvel studios iron man 3 cant waitbest quote in the movie lokihow desperate are you that you call upon such such lost creatures to defend youif you enjoyed watching xmen fantastic 4 iron man thor captain america the first avenger the incredible hulk youll enjoy watching the assemble,fantasy
now im not a huge fan of superhero flicks so maybe theres something im missing here but walking out of the theater all i felt was that i had seen 25 hours of nothing but action and drama maybe thats its purpose maybe its just not my cup of tea for whatever reason i was not invested this is hardly an interesting or exciting film and i see no reason for the rave reviews or exceptional  it is makingi suppose it has something to do with being a fan as i said earlier i am in no way a fan of hero movies but this one got such good reviews that i had to check it out i was disappointed because surprise surprise it felt exactly like every other superhero movie that had ever been made even more so since its a combination of all of the previous heroes into one film so really its not original or different or exciting or moving or anything it just is,fantasy
before i went to the movie i was shopping for tshirts online and found one that looks like the nascar symbol you know the oneit looks like the word nascar in motion with a bunch of colors coming off the left side like its a car i guess anyway someone made a tshirt that looks identical but instead of nascar it says boring lolanyway flash forward to me falling asleep in the movie butt numb and i keep picturing that tshirt boring this movie really boringi think i fell asleep 3 times for about 15 minutes total its hard to sleep too long because every now and then there is an explosion or some other loud whammothe dark knight was way better than this spiderman was way better than thisis it worthy of 1 star no maybe it should be 3 or 4 but im giving the 1 to help offset some of the insane 10s im seeing on here seriously there are people on imdb saying its the best movie they have ever seen in their life really really really oo i smell something fishy going on around herethe movie was completely vapid boring convoluted nothing about the movie was new or interestingim assuming the score has been manipulated by social media hopefully imdb will do something about it i look forward to seeing the score drop consistently for years to come once whoeverwhatever is driving this fake voting moves onto a new project,fantasy
i was eagerly waiting for this movie but after seeing the marvel movie captain america the first avenger thor and incredible hulk i thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years but still due to robert downey jr i wanted to see this film ok i admit it i was blown away by the movie in terms of action and of course humor director joss whedon directed this movie so brilliantly that there are very little or no flaws sufficient screen time has been provided for each of the superheroes but the mighty guys iron manrdj and the hulkmark ruffalo steal the show thorchris hemsworth was too brilliant in this movie youll see more of captain americachris evans than his solo movie which is really great and black widowscarlett johannson kicks the ass off whoever she fights with hawkeyejeremy renner is not at all underused his powers were shown superbly nick furysamuel l jackson was great with his initiative and here it is the main villain lokitom hiddleston steals the show with his mischievous and noworries personality he fits into the role perfectly on the whole the cast were perfect with each of them fitting into the characters with easethe humor and witty one liners are splendid dont expect it to be dark with no humor like the dark knight instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium many people have started comparing with the dark knight but what i say is these two are completely different type of film and comparing the two is not justified still if you compare is better than dark knight due to the reason that can be enjoyed by each and every person it has action and humor both at equal quantitiesas for iron man robert downey jr is iron man no other person can do that role so perfectly unfortunately rdj is about to leave the franchise after iron man 3 i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films including 2 i will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that this film will never disappoint you not even a moment 100  go watch it without doubt i will say that this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films in the film history verdict 1010 stars a excellent,fantasy
spoilersjust when comic book films were truly starting to enjoy a time of true artistic relevance and seemed to be on the verge of officially casting off the shackles of stereotypes and bias that have plagued the genre for decades along comes a film to firmly entrench it in every single hackneyed clich and trope that have been the deservedly derided by the educated communitythe is by far the most uninspired cbm story ive seen from the cbm genre to date disguised by draping a cheap easily exploitable crossover gimmick over it not so dissimilar to the various other poorly conceived amalgamations that have been presented to us over the years in various mediums cartoon all stars avp freddy v jason and most recently dawn of justicepoorly executed nonsensical characterization im always angry basically the 2012 version of your mothers name is martha too forced interactions and stock argument dialogue were not a team were a time bomb subtle and a total lack of dramatic heft give a very light storywise not tone onenote tv episodic feeling to what should have been a complex multi layered epicoverall a conglomeration of fanboy moments vainly stitched together to attempt some sort of narrative,fantasy
at first when i heard of this show i was kinda excited about it but when i went to the cinemas yesterday to watch it i was tempted to leave my seat already at the early part of the show its not the characters or actors that is horrible its the director to be honest i dont know how the script writers come what with this or even how the director approve it but the lines and conversation were so fake blunt and seriously horrible it lakes emotions feelings or even creativeness let alone the whole plot is too predictable and boring no doubt the action scenes is good and the graphic is awesome but the plot and horrible lines just make this show right at the bottom of my list for shows in 2012 i rather watch the dark knight anytime rather than this horrible show even friends of mine who are crazy about dc and marvel comics were absolutely disappointed in this show in fact they leave the theatres during halfway of the show this is just an example to show how horrible it is all in short this show to me is not worth watching or buying and was a waste of 143 minutes of my time,fantasy
i booked tickets for this as my boyfriend wanted to catch it before it left the cinemas and from the trailer it looked like great fun but after a very achy backside from sitting and squirming through 2 an half hours of this tripe bored out of my brain just wasnt worth it the only good thing about this film was downy jr hes an incredible actor in his own right and if it wasnt for him id be giving it 010 just cant understand why people are soooo hyped over it very clich bad acting apart from jr dialogue was atrocious and the story has been done time and time before yawn i was expecting something sooo much more from this film and it fell flat,fantasy
from the moment samuel l jackson walked in during the postcredits scene of iron man four years ago talking about the initiative the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of marvels greatest icons well four years and five films later the have finally assembledand as expected it was with a wave of sheer awesomenessunlike the previous marvel cinematic universe films the isnt really into complex plotting here the premise is simpleloki the asgardian god seeks to facilitate the invasion of earth by an alien raceand nick fury director of shield responds by activating the initiative bringing together armored hero iron man robert downey jr reprising the character for the third time lokis brother and asgardian warrior thor chris helmsworth the living legend and man out of time captain america chris evans gamma radiations expert dr bruce banner and his monstrous alter ego the hulk both played to perfection by mark ruffalo following in the footsteps of edward norton and clandestine operatives hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson what follows is the usual hero vs villain farealbeit on a scale about a billion times larger than that of say spiderman indeed one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across new york city taken in the battles of each of the six across the breadth of the big applea testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself but the threat faced by the heroes inuniverseaction and spectacles aside the real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters downey jr turns in another memorable performance as tony stark which was to be expected and tom hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal god lokibut it is newcomer to the marvel movieverse mark ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius bruce banner and the rampaging hulk ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character and his inner struggles which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors his banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good samuel l jackson really gets to shine here as nick fury after his cameos in previous filmson a parting note there has been an unfortunate tendency for months on message boards blogs and forums across the internet to create some kind of a competition between the and nolans upcoming epic the dark knight rises having seen the former i can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for the is not aiming to surpass the dark knight rises any more than star wars was aiming to surpass the godfather they are two totally different films belonging to different genres and literally whole different universes and as fans we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits,fantasy
as a reviewer i dont mess up often but just like the line where stark is ribbing loki sometimes even an imdb top reviewer can have performance issuesmy first view i was annoyed that so much time was spent on backstory and it took an hour to get the ball rolling although in fairness once this story starts to move in the second hour it movesby my third viewing i could see the issue i grew up with these characters and i had expectations the expectations were incorrect i now know because those expectations were the reason the marvel library was such a mess before the arrival of the whedon brosso what joss did was analyzed what was not working in past marvel films then deconstructed the story then build a film which could act as a base for future sequels wit ha solid foundationand wrote a script to die for by the third time around i was actually listening to the film instead of just watching and boy can that guy writelike the line i posted as the title of this review it took me 3 viewings to catch it it is sly it is sexual and it is totally easy to overlook in all the action but i was on the floor laughingso there you go it is fun action packed last hour written at an oscar level the characters are perfectly cast except the nick fury i grew up with was caucasion but i guess no one remembers and to keep the suits happy not only made a bundle on its own but launched a new franchiseso thats a 10att imdb readers in the blind  att imdb readers in the blindjust watched this for the 8th time and want to update my review as of this year 2017 this is at the same time one of the best action films in the history of the medium and one of the best scripts in the history of action films i believe joss received only one award for the screenplay which is a pity because it shows that the industry simply does not respect this genre the little twists and turns that hold viewer attention like glue im always angry puny god are a whedon trademark and massively underappreciated i will also suggest that nothing with the marvel brand that has arrived since i has been this good  and i am including all their tv and other offcable projects in that comment the only flaw and i mean the only one is that the close of this film sets an entire armada of politically correct followups having to do with the public blaming superheroes  for being superheroes personally as a superhero fan for over 60 years i think that entire arc sucks and one day marvel will figure that out otherwise perfect film,fantasy
storytelling as an art whats that and who cares anyway when hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies then wheres the financial incentive to make decent films 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades and i have been going to the movies for over 40 years so thats saying something for really bad blockbusters first hunger games nextdark shadows and now thei am so sick and tired of new york city specifically the island of manhattan being attacked in the movies hello it was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3000 real people including my brothers coworker wife and unborn child but what is really despicable is that at the very end of the the you briefly get to see a reallife news photo from 911 mourning the dead thats just plain disgusting exploitation but lets not stop there at the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local new york state senator rant about how our avenger heroes wrecked manhattan that our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1000 ways are to blame for all the destruction fine i agree many politicians are real jerks but to put the letter d next to this senators name speaks volumes about the films real message democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful winy creeps thats real cute i thought hollywood was sooooooo liberal if you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a r after the senators name after all the republicans in congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a federally funded medical fund for first responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic waste that was released into the air the is also plain boring with the most twodimensional characters in the history of film making sure i wanted the good guys to win sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty but really now who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching frosty the snowman for the tenth time the last third of the is nothing more than war porn i will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from the as long as i live even for free or if hollywood offers me a million dollars overall hollywood has done a decent job with the xmen and the fanatic four but for some reason the rightwing kooks who control the avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine no wonder why stan lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film its just too bad he and the rest of hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck,fantasy
ill preface im not a comic book reader i enjoy fantasy as long as it makes sense in its own selfcreated universe star wars and trek harry potter superman but the is awful and even worse considering how highly rated this junk is on imdb it has a couple moments of delight but so did the phantom menace and the effects are state of the art bar none but this is the 50th movie in a row where the photorealistic effects impressed me now im afraid i need a real movie to use that cgi to good effectthe fails for me due to the character combination i didnt read a single comic book but universal released this huge budget movie knowing they will need to attract 10 new people for everyone who read the dusty old comic books the are a dumb assembly of heroes captain america is an idiot character he is from a different time isnt good at anything modern like why is he barking orders and has no powers whatsoever ditto for black widow and hawkeye i mean the latter shoots friggin arrows cappy had a shield and punches guys within 5 feet of him they are just plain lame thor is a god and the hulk is invincible theyre immortal unstoppable and iron man with his impossibletobelieve suit which might as well be magicbased is also nearly invincible who needs the other 3 why isnt spiderman in this group or some of the xmen as for the humans why do we have a citysized aircraft carrier that flies and looks amazingly like the big aircraft from avatar why build a ship that flies okay now the plot i dont get it this movie is 222 minutes i dont even understand lokis motivation or plan loki wants to blow up earth why why do those aliensclash of the titans monsters want to blow up earth why could thor and loki get to earth but they cant without the magic portal are those monsters magical or technological and that cube  seriously they used the same lame mcguffin from transformers which is a movie very much like this one i mean that as an insult what was lokis plan crumble the outer shells of buildings in nyc shoot a lot and not hit anyone not one human even seemed to get hit with all the devastationi hated it my wife and kids hated it my 9 year old son hated it that says it all it made no sense was utterly talky and boring for a huge chunk of it the dark knight wipes its rear end with this bluray disc avoid at all costs unless you liked transformers 3 john carter and clash of the titans,fantasy
the 21st century has seen more superhero movies than i can count this year alone has already seen black panther i wont deny that stan lee created a diverse variety of dogooders in the marvel universe the not to be confused with the 1960s tv series is entertaining enough its nothing special  much of it is sensory overload  but its nothing that it doesnt pretend to be loki is the common suave but malevolent villain he could trick anyone into thinking that hes a decent person this movie will definitely please the leonard hofstadters sheldon coopers howard wolowitzes and raj koothrapalis of the worldit was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the world security council got played by jenny agutter the nurse in an american werewolf in london id like to see a crossover between this movie and john landiss horror movieanyway its not the ultimate masterpiece but undeniably fun,fantasy
first of all i didnt watch that many superhero movies so i sadly dont know much about the different characters and their universes but i like the idea of bringing them all together in a single movie and for me it works the whole concept is a great idea and the story is really good and exciting i also love the effects and the different characters that are thrown together i also love that it portrays superheroes with different strengths but also their weaknesses they arent portrayed as superhuman as you could expect they all have many things to learn and their flaws so what more can i say as a guy that dont know anything about marvels universes else than it is really recommendable and it deserves top score,fantasy
i saw the on may 17 personally im not much of a superhero fan but i quite enjoyed the movie in my opinion the is a pretty good and entertaining movie and its a good theatrical experience james berardinelli wrote in his review the kicks ass i agreeover the last few years five movies have been made  iron man iron man 2 thor the incredible hulk and captain america  which have built up to and became prequels to the there were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected and now this movie confirms it the are all assembled in this film iron man captain america thor the hulk the black widow and hawkeye yes theyre all played by the same actors and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the prequels mentioned above the villain in the movie is loki who was the villain in thor and who now plans on using the tesseract a powerful energy cube to open a portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with a powerful army the are called together by nick fury who runs an agency called s h i e l d and they must stop loki from carrying out his plans theres more to the story but i wont give any more awayim sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie however its really not worth it given there are so many good things about the movie and the entire experience is very enjoyable so im not going to bother with an indepth reviewcriticism in a way the film is sort of criticproof for lack of a better term so heres my advice dont dissect or overly analyze the movie just sit back and enjoy it thats not to say that its a total transformerslike junk movie or anything its actually halfway decentthe actors put on a good performance and really bring out their characters and the interactions between the characters are good  the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well the story is pretty solid and its coherent and appropriately paced the visual and special effects and action scenes are great alan silvestri composed an effective score for the movie overall the movie is halfway decent its smart and its entertaining and unlike many junk films like michael bays it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement and it has a good wise balance between story and actioneffects the twoandahalf hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me so while i dont think this movie is great its definitely entertaining and worth seeing and its a very good theater experiencemy rating 12 out of ,fantasy
the is quite possibly the most anticipated superhero movie in history but does it quite live up to the hypei know that this is the marvel movie we have all been waiting for this is the movie that all the others made by marvel studios has been leading up to this is what they have been aching to show usi was pleased to learn that i would be given the chance to see the movie before its may release date in the united states but despite my privileged opportunity i went in with relatively low expectations its just another superhero movie but with a bunch of them at one time rightwrongif you are a fan of marvel superheroes great cgi or just allaround intense action films you must see marvels the the cgi was the best ive seen in a long time the fighting as intense as ever and the plot is topnotch but these things arent the only aspects of the movie that make the great for me it was the characters yes weve seen all these characters before weve enjoyed their specific movies but having them on screen together worked better than i could have imagined in fact that was why i was apprehensive at first i had been afraid that perhaps one hero would take away more screen time than another we all have our favorites but this wasnt the case tony stark robert downy jr provided his much expected wit and humor for the film causing the crowd to laugh on many occasions the banter between stark and steve rogerscaptain america chris evans flowed well and added a lot to the character depth i wasnt sure how thor chris hemsworth would be playing his part either i thought he actually might be taking too much screen time from the others since his brother loki tom hiddleston was the main antagonist but this wasnt the case i found myself most excited in the movie when bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo came on screen his character was done so well for this movie i found myself thrilled and even scared in some of his scenesi must also mention here that ruffalo did a superb job of taking edward nortons place as bruce banner the hulk if theres one thing that annoys me about sequels its when they change actors but i actually enjoyed ruffalo better in this roleof course you cant forget about hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarlett johansson and nick fury samuel l jackson each of them played their part of the story wonderfully though i found sam jacksons acting to be a little stalei would say that if you havent watched the other movies made by marvel studios that you might want to watch them most references will be lost on you if you dont as far as screen time it felt like every character got their time in the light no one person stole the show and just as marvel intended they all stole the showthere is one particular scene that i enjoyed where the camera panned to each hero doing their own special moves though its hard to explain further than that without giving anything away however there were moments in the movie where i had to lean over to my wife and ask what someone was talking about but these instances were minorobviously if you care anything about marvel movies youre already planning to see the if you havent seen any of the other marvel studios films take a weekend watch them then go see the i dont think youll be sorry you did,fantasy
ugh wore me out lets begin with this spoilfest review the character i was most looking forward to being fleshed out was hawkeye who starts out as a zombie loki has a good entrance but his alienbuddies are never fleshed out named or given any character development whatsoever apparently their advance warfare includes just reallydrunken aerial driving thor was a pure letdown he had no swagger wasnt boisterous and his costume changed without rhyme or reason plus he just poof appeared and this killed the beautiful and tragic unrequited love ending of thor plus plus he didnt even try to find jane or even pound her with a hailstorm or anything maria hill was just annoying eyecandy whose stunning visage countered her lack of plotpoints and captain america was lackluster black widow was okay hulk was funny but it was kind of creepy how he went after black widow he spends half the movie telling everyone not to bring out the bad guy then he kind of reveals in the movies silliest moment that oh golly gee i can do this anytime i want to and pepper potts as a daisyduke wearing penthouse babe i dont think so the worst continuity of the series fell on iron man at the end of the incredible hulk it was setup where tony stark was forming the then we find out in the that he wouldnt even be accepted no odin no jane no tender flashback scene for caps loveinterest i felt the movie really could have benefited from some rollercoaster ride instead of all peaks i was surprised to see jenny agutter listed in the credits apparently she was an unnamed councilmember who was so poorly lit she didnt stand out the best part was agent coulson who died wtf and who was the rogue pilot who took it upon himself to nuke new york no hints at future teammates no real philosophic underpinnings like xmen had it was kind of just disneyworld on crack but it was fun to see on opening night,fantasy
this movie is the best i did not expect it to be good warning this will have spoilers if you havent seen this stop reading loki is back and nick fury is calling the thorhulkcaptain america hawkeyeiron manand black widow iron man was funny robert downey jr is the best iron man also the hulk is funny one part hulk punches thor if you havent seen the after credits of thor and you dont understand why lokis back go watch the after credits for thor and it will explain during the credits their is a villain that leaves for a sequel also after the credits its the best seen it show them eating now im finished i give this a perfect 10,fantasy
i always like comic based movies and this one did not disappoint much action which is why i watch these movies there were plenty of hollywood retard thinking which i wont mention so not to ruin the people that are not bother by it many funny moments and again lots of action i would of also like if there had been full movies or some more back story on some of the characters but overall the movie was fun to watch great use of computer graphics and great sound track in addition the plot was not rich which i think is acceptable in action moviesdefinitely a great movie for anyone that like action flicks,fantasy
the  catch it  a  the anticipation for the movie is undeniable we have been waiting for this from years to understand the movie its really important that youve seen all previous ironman the incredible hulk thor and captain americas movies as the give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the empty headed about heros history will be foolish the brings back our beloved marvels heroes tony stark iron man thor dr bruce banner hulk steve rogers captain america natasha romanoff black widow clint barton hawkeye agent maria hill agent phil coulson and director nick fury each heros journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies now the stands strong in every department from direction production and performances it wont be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes the humor action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous marvel movies combined the credit goes to generous brain of joss whedon he brings out something very special out of each superhero the interaction between all superheroes is something we dont see often they tease make fun and even fight with each other robert downey jr ironman is great as always he brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today chris hemsworth thor is truly a god of thunder his entry is as big as thors entry should be it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him chris evens captain america is indeed the ultimate american hero he got the charm and personality of a true america hero some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to mark ruffalo the incredible hulk for the first time we see some humor in the actions of hulk he is just not a fury green monster this time around besides hulk the biggest surprise is scarlett johansson black widow we have seen the part of her in ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of black widow she is absolutely stunning and fantastic jeremy renner hawkeye is good and i hope to see him someday with black widow they had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention clark gregg cobie smulders and samuel l jackson the sheild are fun to watch tom hiddleston loki is superb he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in thor he has out done himself again gwyneth paltrow pepper potts appearance is appreciated and i would have loved to see natalie portman jane foster in it too on the whole the is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time its filled with great performance humor action graphics and brilliant direction highly recommended in 3d,fantasy
yeah much like everyone else i friggin loved this movie this is the purest comic book movie i have ever seen and for that reason alone it works everything from the writing to the action to the humour to the chemistry between characters to even the pacing feels like it was pulled straight from the pages of the lavishly ludicrous and having one of the gods of cult scififantasy not to mention a comic book writer at the helm of this movie was probably the only way this movie could have possibly met with everyones expectations45 years of buildup to this movie and it more than just pays off it wins the jackpot i am yet to find a person who didnt like this movie and i can fully understand why i honestly tried to find something about it to even nitpick at and found nothing this is the ultimate comic book movie i highly recommend this to any lover of action superhero or scifi movies as well as to any avid comic book readers for all those who dont fit into these categories this movie may just convert you,fantasy
being at one time a young ten year old kid who cut his teeth on cowboy sam books and john henry and the doublejointed steam drill as well uncle arthurs bedtime stories the adventures of the marvel universe were a welcome introduction into what the older kids were reading and doing stan lee and jack kirby somehow as though by divine guidance properly gauged the angst of those teenage years in the sixties and the zeitgeist of that era before the battled the space phantom i cannot remember when i ever encountered a superhero like the hulk basically he was a bully in diapers who did not play well with others after the at last sent the space phantom back into limbo where he belonged the hulk related that his feelings were hurt by the remarks others made about him during the heat of battle he gave the his walking papers and jumped off into parts unknownthis never would have happened in the justice leagueduring the showing i attended after the credits were done there is a scene where the are sitting together in a restaurant eating the expressions on their faces indicate that they would all rather be somewhere else when i first saw it it appeared a little nonsequitur and just something addedon to pique interest but then i went to my volume 1 of the essential which covers the first twenty four issues of their saga i decided to use it as a reference for my remarks in this review when i got to page two of issue two there it was right at the bottom essentially the same scene that tagged the end of the movie oh the setting was different as well as a couple of the characters present or absent but the theme of the scene was identical to the movie a bunch of misfits decide to get together and meet regularly in order to increase and better facilitate group cohesion and they can barely stand being in each others presence its the american experience reductio ad absurdum it is also the human experience should you wish to wax philosophical about itreminds me of something i once heard jesse jackson declare during a speech and i believe he was quoting martin luther king we have to learn to live together no matter how painful or well die apart as fools suffice it to say that for the working together and living together is particularly painful at timesno robert downey jr would not have ordinarily come to mind as tony stark aka iron man with his yuppie insouciance but this is a new generation with its own issues and tastes so theres no use asking where have you gone errol flynn and ronald coleman theyre probably having lunch with joe dimaggio downey in his own way does more than represent with iron manknowing this genre intimately and well this time i may be too close to it to effectively evaluate it there are all kinds of things in this movie that do not fit but thats the glory of the marvel universe it is a depot for all the things that do not fit that are somehow made to achieve this transcendent irreverent harmony rhythm and balance as edward g robinson once said in the cincinnati kid sort of like lifesamuel l jackson has no real business being in the doing his usual scenery chewing channeling bits of shaft and hawk and the black mans angst about wanting in on the american dream for one thing the original nick fury was a white world war two hero who headed a squad called sgt furys howling commandos he would probably be in his nineties by now but only a time chosen few would know that besides thats the beauty of this fantasy scenario nobody really questions what or who these superpowered characters are supposed to be avenging actually theyre more like the final guardians than anyway you really would be missing the point pursuing this line of questioning here are all these odds and ends of personality and deathdefying events and cultural themes somehow welded and soldered together in a kind of collage of imagination and experience and juvenile science fiction and it all works because in the end this aint your universe its the marvel universe and youre just living and thrilling in it when you look at it that way samuel l jacksons nick fury gets down and gets back and redefines the american dream as something more than that house with the little white picket fence and perhaps simply the divine right to be whatever you want to bejoss whedon and zak penn finally wised up and decided to stand on the shoulders of giants stan lee and jack kirby instead of jumping off to do their own thing with the marvel universe they have written a tale to celebrate joss whedons direction is marvelouseque rather than a penetrating interpretation that sometimes hits and sometimes misses as in the case with sam ramis spiderman movieschris hemsworth as thor chris evans as captain america mark ruffalo as the hulk tom huddleston as loki scarlet johansson as the black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye and gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts all have sufficient back stories now either through prior movies or the comics for the audience to be thoroughly prepared for what they might do they are all so very nearly the characters themselves that all thats left is to be swept up in the action that is truly our satisfaction and yet the thing that makes the greatest impact in the end is the characters themselveswelcome to the marvel age of comics in cinema,fantasy
the good i was truly impressed with how well they pulled this movie off the visual effects were all very clean the characters were portrayed by the actors very well this movie was loaded with action keeping everyones attention glued to it i was so impressed i went to the theater to see it more than once and recommended it to everyone i was very happy to see most of the actors return to portray their characters in this the bad most characters the hulk was my big issue here mark rufflo was good with the bruce banner character but the graphics for the hulk just did not meet the level of the movie starring edward norton but it was not so bad that i could not look past it and really find enjoyment i will most definitely go see another installment of,fantasy
the movie is certainly marvels best till now and has great effects though little childish at times it is very good as i expected it was one of the best films with descent comedy parts the acting was above average and the dialogues were really mindboggling it was a bit lengthy but was touching every single minute the story was very good and the superheros were described nicely bruce banner very polite when he was not hulk captain america very serious and all that it was defiantly worth watching and is one of the best superhero films i am looking ford for the 2 and i am searching the whole internet for a little glimpse of it,fantasy
loved this movie even at almost 3 hours long it didnt drag joss wheddon firefly and buffy effortlessly out did all of the battle scenes in every transformer movie with the climatic showdown there are even two or three seriously laugh out loud moments mostly concerning the hulk but dont worry the film takes itself fairly seriously so you can escape into the story and immerse yourselffans of ironman thor and captain america will not be disappointed every one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun and of course theres scarletts character black widow yum im giving the movie 1010 2d hd version because its so entertaining and it fulfilled all my expectations you wont be disappointedas far as the format goes though stick with hd there wasnt any real 3d moments if you are hugely into your 3d experience think twice before paying the extra there wasnt any stand out 3d moments but lots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune that must have been spent on production go hd youll get a better experience,fantasy
this film is not only spectacular but its an historic superhero feature film at its best this is worth the wait hell this was worth the wait 7 years ago when it was first developed do we really think this will be in development hell this is the earths mightiest heroes this is something what has never been done before  marvel has got there finger on the pulse in 1998 a minor marvel character featuring a humanvampire hybrid made it way to the big screen in 2000 a group of mutants evolved into the box office in 2002 was the year of the spiderafter daredevil hulk ang lee the punisher elektra manthing fantastic four  ghost rider marvel studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through paramount pictures  the funding will come from a sevenyear 525 million revolving credit facility with merrill lynch the result led to the creation of the marvel cinematic universe sounds cool right it was no really it fin was iron man made its motion picture debut the hulk got rebooted thor  captain america have finally got the big screen treatment then came a huge shift in the marvel universe marvel entertainment is now owned by mickey mouseamazing disney let go the power rangers franchise  bought marvelbut after everything from comics to tv  film marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company  knowing the fact that the biggest supporters including me are the fans that is why they can not disappoint us yeah we complain about story lines costumes  special effects but if they stay true to the comics the films would have done its justice but i know deep down marvel studios will always put out films  stay close to the material so what ive said earlier was it worth the wait yes yes it was definitely worth itmarvel studios the cast  crew of the did an amazing job  on the marvel cinematic universe  i cant wait to see what comes nextnow if dc  warner bros step their game up we would like to see the justice league into the big screen,fantasy
as you well know by now the is a largescale superhero film that was four years in the making with no less than four individual  yet interconnected superhero films  feeding into this films overall story joss firefly whedon was the director and cowriter on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the marvel comics superhero team cocreated by stan lee who also appears in a very small cameo like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating and the late jack kirby steve rogerscaptain america chris evans tony starkiron man robert downey jr bruce bannerthe incredible hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth natasha romanoffthe black widow scarlet johansson and clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner are the six misfits chosen by nick fury agent of shield samuel l jackson to defeat the traitorous asgardian misfit loki tom hiddleston and his alien army from laying waste to new york city and of course six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world what gets the many points is that beside its big action sequences fights and special effects we never really lose sight of the characters who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this and who they are i liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again  even though theyve all already appeared in previous superhero films its all big superhero fun with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind sit back and enjoy1010ps what happened to dr henry hank pymgiantman and janet van dynethe wasp werent they part of the original team lineup before the 4 when captain america became team leader marking the characters silver age debut this was my only real complaint about the,fantasy
ill admit it i was extremely doubtful about this film ive loved joss whedons work my entire life and i had enjoyed all the previous marvel films that led up to this one especially iron man but the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 12 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible but the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky once the film started i was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen i knew that joss whedon had done it the is without a doubt my favorite marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made whedon did a great job writing this masterful witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly the actors did such a great job playing these characters again and it didnt seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to be in the spotlightespecially the hulk once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you cant help but fill with happiness the entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done i am extremely delighted to say that joss whedon has done the impossible and made one of the most entertaining movies ever made,fantasy
i know theres comic book fans that have their favorites theres also the film fans that have their own favorites there are also some who are so enamored and in love with the dark knight that they will pounce on any film that is considered better for me ive never been a big comic book guy but i do enjoy a good film adaptation of them i can love the dark knight and iron man i dont have a bias i enjoy several of these type of films regardless of the company brand or filmmaker for me i absolutely love the it brought out the little kid in me at 33 cynical and disgruntled thats a major compliment i understand that the film is by no means perfect but it was just so much damn fun it made me want to buy a costume and play make believe in the backyard again but again im 33 so i mean that figuratively i just really had a blast with this and this is the best theater experience ive had since seeing a star wars movie i loved it and cant wait to see it again so for those who have hangups about how you dont want to hear its better or more popular than this or that dont get caught up in that nonsense who cares where people rank the or iron man or the dark knight or what have you it doesnt matter so just do yourselves the favor of seeing this movie it is just a boatload of fun,fantasy
cannot find too much fault in this film apart from maybe the fact you will need to have seen all previously related films luckily i had seen iron man 1 and 2 captain america and thor so i knew the back story from the getgoi feel all of the characters were given enough screen time i would have maybe liked to see thor a bit more i think he was underused he could have done a lot more with his massive power like killing one of those massive lizard things on his own the character of the hulk was brilliantly well played by mark ruffalo he portrayed banner as a very calm and collected man and very laid back which is needed for him it created a newfound interest in the character for me as i was never a great fan of the hulk as always robert downey jr did a fantastic job of iron man with the majority of the films funny lines coming from himchris hemsworth borough back the mighty thor and did so tremendously like i said i think he could have been used a lot more the black widow was also a nice addition even though she had appeared previously in iron man 2 although the tight leather outfit was a bit distracting lol i found it incredibly hard to stop looking at her behind but luckily i was wearing 3d glasses in the dark so nobody could tellhawkeye was really well played for some reason the actor looks a lot like gerard butler to me i dont know why but regardless he is a great character and i found it very funny when he asked iron man for a lift up to a roof of a building and tony stark replied ok hang on then legolas little funny lines like that made the entire cinema laugh a lotthe humour of the film mainly came from iron mantony stark also quite a lot of funny moments came from bruce bannerthe hulk i was a bit confused as to why he can suddenly control the hulk when he completely lost control on the ship earlier on there were deep and meaningful thoughts about bruces alter ego but there was a lot of humour to be had from the hulk as well particularly when he smashes loki on the ground again and againone small annoyance i had was the continuity on the level of strength and toughness each character had in the film thor he was made to look like the most powerful being ever with one whack sending big ice men flying 50 feet in the air but in this film he only whacks them back about ten feet which is exactly the same distance captain america and iron man can hit which it shows in the fight scene involving the three of them its just an annoyance of mine but i found it hard to figure out which one of them had the most strength fair enough steve rogers is a super soldier but thor is a demigod you would think he would have a lot more more strength in comparison one second a whack from thors hammer can knock the hulk ten feet away but it doesnt even leave a scratch on captain americas shield and yes i know the shield is made with some indestructible material mentioned in the cap film but the hulk is quite tough too and he got knocked away completelyi also kinda wished they fought directly next to each other more you never see all of them at the exact same place theyre always scattered about and you never get the feeling they are a full team throughout the film i was waiting for some epic bit where all 5 of them pulled off some unique combo that involved all of them but the most i got was two or three of them in the same place in the final battlebut all in all the film is brilliantly well done action scenes are engrossing and genuinely frightful you get some empathy for bruce banner you genuinely worry about certain characters and i for one was thrilled with it i was worrying it might be too many characters for one film but they nailed it,fantasy
lets be honest all the previous marvel films leading to the were great  story wise acting wise effect wise etc iron man i  ii thor captain america all turned out to be surprise box office hits and one can see the point so when at the end of every movie a post credits scene was shown depicting that there is something even greater planned the expectations were raised pretty highjoss whedon firefly cabin in the woods took into account that set expectations of both comic book fans and nonfans alike and put together a superhero flick thatll rest proudly as the conclusion to its predecessors the screenplay writers the vfx studio the actors robert downey jr has always been my favorite all deserve creditan action packed blockbuster movie that already has every record broken and every voice cheering the is one of the best movies this year a must watch even if youre not into this stuff 10 on 10,fantasy
did not live up to my expectations at all for a movie with such hype it was very long and the picture was very dark too many overly dramatic lines and the buildup music lasted for practically the whole movie i usually love superhero movies but this one was a letdown i dont know why it got such great ratings the iron man thor hulk and captain america movies were more enjoyable on their own i thought it would be great to see all these heroes come together but i think it really just lead to so many main characters that the audience didnt get a chance to understand any of them individually special effects were great dont get me wrong and the 3d was cool but that wasnt enough to save the movie storyline was too stretched out underwhelming opening the movie didnt evoke my emotions i wasnt scared sad excited relieved when i should have been a bunch of characters that are interesting on their own plus special effects does not equal a great movie overall im disappointed,fantasy
uk title assemble restofworld the just like transformers dark of the moon this film was eagerly anticipated by fans such as myself i could not wait for the film to be released on 26th april unlike tf3 however this film live up to the hype it surpassed my expectations and i expected a lot it didnt feel forced and certainly did not feel like a sequel to one particular leadup film it felt like a wellmade sequel to all the filmsthe final battle wasnt just an allout brawl  it seemed integral to the story and characterisation of the film every character had their time to shine and they were as you remember them from their buildup films  tony stark was cocky witty and likable steve rodgers was patriotic a manoutoftime and focused on the mission and thor was a demigod warrior then theres the hulk played by mark ruffalo instead of ed norton this time around this hulkbanner was perfect ruffalo brought a sense of humour to this famously angry character and really helped pulloff the hulk where others have either tried and failed hulk 2003 or tried and only just failed the incredible hulk 2008 we also got a brief look at black widow scarlett johansons background and her relationship with hawkeye jeremy renner even next to their superpowered teammates these two proved their worth to be part of the teamtom hiddleston as loki was brilliant samuel l jackson as nick fury was what youd expect from this actor clark gregg was once again great as phil coulson and cobie smulders as maria hill was a good decision and while her performance was good i feel she was underused this film has and amazing soundtrack brilliant actors likable characters even loki great 3d effects an enjoyable story and epic action congratulations and thank you to director joss whedon and the rest of the crew for putting together a masterpiece,fantasy
action movies will now have a new leader as assemble by marvel raises the bar to an entirely new levelthe hype made by marvel in 2011 by introducing thor and captain america to the audience in quick succession just as a precursor for the is lived up and surpassed with what will be one of the beacons in modern era action moviesthe boasted budget of 220mis well spent for the movie expectedly satisfies you as a visual treat with what i thinkone of the best cg effectsalsothis one does deserve a heads up to be watched in 3d unlike annoyingly many in the recent pastthoughthe first half has a few more than necessary scenes shot in the darkbut it gets better as the movie progressesthough the plot is pretty straightforwardthere are so many characters in the movie to keep you entertained in their very own signature fashioneach and every character is given nearly equal importance and nobody is left outwhich is an effort to appreciate they have really put a lot of efforts in the new hulk to bring him up to join the party with othersand boy it does pay off exceptionally welliron mans powers are tested to a very new level and being the most skilled avengerthey had to behe has got some new moves watch out for themi am really starting to like captain america and the way he handles the situation the time transitioned character of his adjusts surprisingly quickly to the new scenarioblack widow and hawkeye who had brushing references in previous movies are full fledged now but i wish marvel to bring them up in singlesthere are a few much needed subtle humorous moments exercising your jaws sideways in between a lot of fantastically choreographed action scenes keeping them dropped down for most of the timebout the cast downey jr undoubtedly stands out as an actor with his amazing comic timing and the way he carries the arrogance of ironman the search for bruce banner has ended up giving the most subtle hulk yetwith mark ruffalothe rest of the cast looks just supportive cobie smulders was supposed to be the eye candybut scarlett johansson steals the show in that aspect not to mention in her alterego superhero moves tooall in all an awesome summer blockbuster with wholesome entertainment the is surely one of the best action movies to watch before you leave this dimension,fantasy
the is a cleanburning sixcylinder entertainment  a walltowall action bonanza executed with a fluid coherence it laughs in the face of expectation and instead sets its own bar that all blockbusters need to followfollowing on from the first thor flick the demigods evil brother loki a deliciously fiendish tom hiddleston is intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an allpowerful energy cube thatll allow him to bring his alien armies to earth trouble starts when this glowing cube of untold power called the tesseract is appropriated by loki who with a nudge from his magic assegai brainzaps a snap marksman hawkeye a competent jeremy renner and a top scientist into his evil scheme of world domination all that stands in his way is nick fury the ever reliable samuel jackson the head of the covert peacekeeping organization shield who sets about uniting the worlds superheroes to avert the threat rounding up our titular team  iron man a hilarious robert downey jr the hulk a subversively charming mark ruffalo thor the charismatic chris hemsworth captain america a sincere turn by chris evans and black widow the sexy but earnest scarlett johansson  hoping they will be greater than the sum of their parts problem is theyre a dysfunctional outfit with differences of opinion and troubled pasts and one of them is a gigantic green loose cannon now with a global catastrophe looming they must subsume individual will to the collective good but loki isnt called the god of mischief for nothing before furys new super team can find its balance loki is in their heads sowing seeds of doubt distrust anger and conflict can earths mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet  or is their coming together an even bigger threat than loki himselfthe doesnt buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast largely because of joss whedon he weaves all of the powderkeg moments into a story that is meaningful and always makes sense the point in the is to bring six separate characters together as a team without sacrificing their individuality and by extension their value as solo franchises and whedon does an excellent job of keeping the disparate personalities of his protagonists in play whedons script sparks up the exposition with some sparkling dialogue high stakes and balls tothewall action spectacle if you dont believe me check out the thrilling alienbashing finale on the streets of manhattan  it is a pure fan boy wetdream smart funny pulsating and surprisingly cathartic joss whedon succeeds in appeasing its core fanbase from ambition to scale to the way it justly balances each remarkable character the is utterly stimulating satisfyingly scripted and damn right faultless big screen entertainment the make us do something increasingly rare in these overfranchised times  root for a sequel go smash,fantasy

the danger with every superhero movie is that it will end up either horrifically unrealistic or unappealing to anyone over the age of ten i am pleased to say that the does not fall into either of these pitholes  in fact it has to be awarded the title of one of the best films of 2012the actors were all amazingly casted in their respective roles and do an amazing job of creating intriguing and lovable characters many of them were reprising roles they had taken on in previous films  captain america thor or iron man for example  so we already had a good idea of how they would perform but i feel they all exceeded expectations robert downey jr was incredible as the humorous yet conflicted tony stark iron man and chris evans was brilliant as the confused outoftime steve rogers captain america mark ruffalo the newbie of the cast stepped into the role of bruce banner hulk with great skill and dispersed all doubts as to his suitability on the other side tom hiddleston really has to be congratulated for his convincing and somehow relatable performance as the villain loki whose wit and tricks appealed to fans everywherethe special effects in this movie were undoubtedly excellent and despite their need to be ostentatious never seemed unnecessarily unrealistic the director joss whedon did a fabulous job and has created a cinematic classic that will be praised for years to come,fantasy
the movie was absolute trash horrible scripts least menacing villain ever no chemistry between the actors and mundane story line the movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 85 rating its alright as a kids movie it does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2 the movie is often commended for its humor in my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile nothing special at all despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie so if you want watch at least a decent super hero flick you might as well pick up watchmen xmen first class spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy,fantasy
did anybody see inception i think that was just about the most ambitious movie ive ever seen and then i thought wait a god damn second marvel studios is going to take all their top superheroes and theyre going to put them all together in the thats the most ambitious movie ive ever seen  robert downey jr comic con 2010it may have been the most ambitious movie ever but boy did they pull it off there was always a small doubt that the 2012 may have been a flop for a couple of reasons the first is the fact that the captain america 2011 and iron man 2 2010 were slightly lower than the standard of movies marvel studios had shot out since 2008 when the incredible hulk 2008 hit the big screens obviously this lower standard must have been due to the being in production because the film topped my list of favourite films and became number 1 yes it took over the dark knight 2008to read the full review go here httpwwwteknuecomreviewsreview theassemble2012852,fantasy
six super heros versus one nemesis otherwise usually its one against one the fact is this film is overhyped and doesnt live up to what it claims to be nor does it complement the critics excitement which is to rave the first action movie of the summer  like a ritual and to be quoted in the ads while watching i asked myself how many times have i seen done to death special effects like a gaping hole in the sky the aliens raining and attacking new york technical jargon supplemented by devices and gizmos some huge contraption passing for a space station floating in the sky and so much executed and projected before that i felt fatigued the 3d effects are absent where they should have been in your face and more  like when the black widow holds the gun at a character and the nozzle is out of the frame the cohesive factor and which keeps it going is the tongue in cheek wit which everyone is blessed with so much so such dialogues appear to be out of a mad satire and to think of it when thor knew loki so well or his psyche then why send for the other five,fantasy
i can not say anything more about the the movie just hit all the right spots and a lot more it didnt only entertain like how a brainless popcorn movie would it told a great superhero team storythe characters were written perfectly the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch the story had the perfect balance of comedy action and drama yes theres a bit of that too and its good its everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movieevery member of the lineup whether super powered or not got the right amount of screen time if you were like me and thought that iron man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like iron man and friends your fears will be washed away mark ruffalo also stole the show as banner the hulk if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after edward norton was left behind fear not since he does the job well i can go as far as saying that ruffalo is the best incarnation of banner so far josh whedon pulled off the impossible he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation he created what i consider the best superhero movie so far he made theto say anything more would be a waste of time just go and watch it,fantasy
i wonder when people will understand that they are watching the same movies over and over again with only different heroes even without watching the movie an 8 year old can write a summary of it and it would be 90 accurate bla bla bla good guys come together bla bla bla they start up pretty good bla bla bla they argue bla bla bla they reunite and kick the villains ass how original and this thing applies for 99 of the marvel movies and about 80 for dc and there are major logic mistakes also like captain america can protect himself from enemies with a shield not bigger than a large plate i know its a super hero movie but reallyits like bad guys are not even trying no need to talk about black widow use your minds people,fantasy
short versionbecause of the imdb word limit go here for the full versionhttpwwwrottentomatoescomuserid974206291ratingsah the how i hate this movie it is overrated and overpopular beyond words and has nothing which makes a film great the only things it has are good special effects and a nice soundtrack  factors which are only superficial in nature and cannot make anything good its story is filled with plotholes and characterization and character development is below subpar the story doesnt even try to explore any themes and the whole thing is just one huge galore of special effectsthe visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing about the movie which is good the explosions spaceships villains weapons iron mans suit everything looks realistic and wonderful of course that is to be expected with the technology of today the sound section is also nothing to complain about the sound amplifies the action and makes one excited about it other than that i found it quite forgettable the acting is decent robert downey jr as always speaks as fast as a cheetah runs which is why people who are not so great at english may need subtitles not that the things he is saying is deep or meaningfulnow that ive finished with the good parts of the movie i can now explain why the story and characters are st i have already said that the story has zero innovation and is totally formulaic the story is about the trademark superheroes fighting a villain bent on conquering the world with the power of a magical object so original right the heroes find the villain who separates them but they come back together almost immediately and fight the villain and his huge army in a large metropolitan city even if you have not seen the movie you should be able to tell how the movie is going to end as mentioned earlier there are a large number of plot holes and plot conveniences and this movie was nominated for best writing in a particular award ceremony in fact one whole hour was spent in pointless battles and the destruction of a major city where only the ending mattered the ending was a total cop out which saw the death of an entire army due the destruction of a single spaceship why because the movie has to end sometime thats why now that ive established how bad the story is i will talk about the characters it may seem that the movie has no need of character introduction and development as each character has a movie of its own this is partly true however the characters are still not developed the include  a billionaire who fights in iron suit a god a soldier from the times of world war ii and a scientist which can go super saiyan an becoming angry how relatablein each of their respective movies they have to fight a villain having similar powers as them yes they have similar powers while building their romance with girl x they do not face any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc any such problem will only be a backdrop the end of the movie will see the villain defeated  the hero victorious and the hero and the girl in a strong relationship the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as failureexcept if they are fighting the villain for the first time loss changeetc all problems mostly revolve the external forceiethe villain this makes them completely unrelatablein case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie the incredibles had its main character fired from his job and the dark knight saw bruce waynes ideals being challenged no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universeill admit that iron man and thor had development however they were the only ones the characters then developed into very similar archetypes as individual movies that was very good but they were a part of a larger universe thus characters being fully developed there was a bad thing because it finally made the characters in the quite boring as they were all good and had absolutely no bad qualities the heroes were just good guys and that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie the villains are mostly faceless mooks who are only there to cause destruction and be defeated by the heroes it is not even known who they were loki on the other hand is the best marvel movie villain thats a great thing right no no it isnt hes just the best looking thrash in the garbage bin having more backdrop and personality makes him better than the rest of those idiots who were just there to be defeated by the heroand the st still doesnt end there i can go on about how everyones powers are broken yes they are broken and how loki was an idiot for keeping the main energy source on top of stark tower and how the heroes grieved over the death of a secondary character saying he never showed you his captain america vintage card collection that character too was bland beyond words and received no fleshing out or development except maybe in the tv seriesverdictits st and doesnt deserve any of the popularity it gets the applause it deserves is for its visual effects which is the only thing for which it has gotten awards other than that it is bad and i would not recommend it to anybodyvisual score1010 sound score810 story210 characters410 overall310 i dont take the average of the above,fantasy
honestly i like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in willy the wonka who has to have all the chocolate this production sic treats the entire audience as low iq zombies no offence to actual zombies intended there is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest at no time whatsoever do you ever feel a sense of suspense or danger at no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm  well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes  obviously and why even bother having humans with no super powers  oh i forgot the humans in it are the most magical unbelievable fighting machines they just stand there wasting anything in their path and im not talking about the super heroes here rambo is but a beginner compared to themevery single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually wintechnically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental the action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears seriously and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding im sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy  but the reality is their mix doesnt translate well across systems bad sound isnt the problem its the post mixing i hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many filmsthe acting by some of the cast is decent considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with but in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years this is a money and profile job  nothing more even then i do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it the directing is amateur hour hisher i dont know and dont care focus is squarely on action and fx  so why not just have the fx team direct it as they certainly would have done a better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job i do wonder if the director has actually ever watched a movie to see how one directs actorsanyway i cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy a movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene aimed at a dumbed down populace  then this is for youps i cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews i certainly smell a rat,fantasy
i can only say thisif you simply know the characters or have a profound knowledge in comics or simply like the fantastic type this is the movie for youi felt like a teenage watching this excellent movie it has a lot of fun action scenes an excellent plot and all the characters have their minutes to shine they are all as we know them from the comics and the moviesa must to all comics loversgoing to see it for the second time today hope all enjoy it as i did and believe me im on countdown for the second already ,fantasy
guess i expected more but shouldnt from a comic book company i did think that much of the acting was above par and quite good in many instances however the poor relationship to obeying or at least extending the laws of physics was just inexcusable ill try to precisely explain my sentiments 1 whats the logic in having an aircraft carrier fly a runway on a ship thats supposedly capable of flying if its possible to make a ship like that fly then wouldnt it also be possible to have other flying craft that dont need a runway get a scientist to review your scripts before hand2 the scant oneliners from robert downey jrs character were annoying at best guess hes an addadhd character trying to appeal to multitude of addadhd fans3 all the hand waving over and around computer screens reminded me of the bad attempt at impressing the viewer that occurred in minority report make the hand waving meaningful and minimal if those screens were really needed then dr bannerhulk would have gotten some useknowledge or gained something from all his hand waving over supposedly touchsensitive screens yet both he and mr downey and others seems obsessed with waving their hands around  for what i did enjoy samuel jacksons character when he responded to the lame navigators excuse the navigation system is reinitializing and he says is the sun up then put it on your left that was the most genuine moment in the whole filmi expected the superior plot and complexity of thor but was sadly disappointed with an rehash of independence style special effects and a lame story of alien invaders all this mediocrity probably didnt impact the titles earnings i just wont be so enthused about catching a sequel maybe worth a netflix or video store rental but not a theater ticket,fantasy
they spend money to make a film you would enjoy you pay money to see a movie and enjoy this is a movie where every penny spend by the producers and the consumers is worth spend movies with so many superheroes are 90 of the time destined to be a chaos yes there is chaos but its not the movie but in the heart of manhattan which is the battleground awesome dialogues rightly timed humor and incredible action you wouldnt have time to chew your popcorn people who have come to imdb to check for reviews just dont spend time hereget a ticket nowwatch it in 3d the movie is made for it,fantasy
marvel has accomplished gathering and teaming up some of the greatest superheroes on the big screen for the first time josh whedon is proved to be one of the best directors for me since this awesome movie has no flaws at all the acting from all the characters is great and the movie is being unwrapped flawlesslythis movie contains some of the most amazing action sequences in the history of cinema i am really happy for being able to watch this piece of artwhich i am sure will remain for ever in my memoryfor all marvel fans and nonfans this is an extremely recommended movie to watchfor this amazing movie my rating is 1010,fantasy
first of all let me just establish the follow imdb film ratings as a referencea clockwork orange 85  aliens 1986 85  american beauty 85  full metal jacket 84  chinatown 84  fargo 82  donnie darko 81  a scanner darkly 7these are the kind of movies that get and should get 8 ratings they have real content theyre innovative original intelligent and thoughtprovoking theyre timeless classicsbut the comparison may not be too fair being such different genres how does it really stand up to batman begins 83 watchmen 76 or any of the xmen series none of which reached and 8 these are all meant to fascinate and woe the same kind of target comicbook fans adrenalinepumped teenagers and actionyearning males yet they are aeons away in terms of originality depth story and execution from 2012s thei dont really have much of a gripe with the itself as after seeing captain america i expected nothing more than another formulaic blockbuster even so its pretty bad even for a fillinthevillainsuperherothreat formula movie a ridiculous super villain flat characters no excitement as you know how things are going to turn outmy disappointment is mostly with imdb id trusted their rating in the past but it seems as if that reliability is no longer either all the reviews are now being written by 10yearolds imdb users are losing brain cells at an incredible pace or somethings pretty fishyhow many reviews that are titled things like awesome blew my mind or coolest superhero movie ever that youd expect to be full of teenage adulation grammatical mistakes and tons of slang are actually very articulately written displaying profound knowledge of script direction acting and character analysis i thought our education system was going down the drain where are all these lucid eloquent youths hiding out and being so instructed and discerning as they are why the hell are they giving such a poorly made mediocre movie such high scoresit looks like the industrys eye has finally set on imdbs viewerdecanting power and is corrupting its authenticity beyond recognition from now on i guess ill have to look elsewhere for real trustworthy reviews,fantasy
if you know the story the only things that will matter will be the special effects if you dont know the story the only things that will matter will be the special effects why well there is no story just special effects  lots of them there is no plot nothing makes sense unless you know the characters backgrounds and if you do you will think this movie should be at least an hour longer so the screenwriter could squeeze some actual dialogues in between all the action if you take away all the eyecandy this movie would be less than 15 minutes long  major flunk imo this is a movie to forget about after you leave the theater and talk about some of the scenes people might have enjoyed it goes into utter oblivion  im sure i wont be looking forward to buying this for my dvdbr collection,fantasy
i saw this movie at a midnight show i had been looking forward to this movie for years and i was so pumped for it after it was over i feel like my mind exploded from the pure awesomeness and amazement that this film brought up until i saw this movie the dark knight was my favorite superhero movie but the beat it how can you expect less from a movie that has iron man captain america hulk and thor in it it was the perfect blend of drama action and comedy joss whedon did what in my opinion no other director could have done the pressure and hype surrounding this movie was immense and it delivered in every way the is the type of movie that everyone can enjoy not just comic book fans,fantasy
i have to say this movie was out of this world exactly what any big fan of comics or of all the marvel movies wanted there was just enough of every character involved i know a large debate can be had on the characters not being like they are in the comics or the plots being different but behind it all they cant just make a really long boring movie with every detail involved its definitely not a movie for the person who doesnt like the previous movies the acting of robert downey jr was brilliant and the addition of the new hulk mark ruffalo was even better it could been debated that ed norton would of been better but if you ask me personally the new hulk was outstanding the movie experience in 3d was also very good i am not a huge fan of 3d movies from the past but after watching the marvel did a great job in all the action scenes where they took full use of the 3d effects over all its a must see actionadventure movie 1010,fantasy
does anyone remember how you or other children when you were young was playing with action figures and came up with the most crappy adventures you can imagine like when batman and buzz lightyear climbed your parents bookshelf godzilla splashed and murdered the lego figures in the bathtub filled with foam or when heman saved barbie from the street sharks well  it must have been that kind of games that joss whedon was playing that made him think of this extremely embarrassing and bad idea of a moviethe is the definition of what a bad american action movie produced in hollywood is i understand why marvel emptied out the whole toy box when they made the comic in the 60s so children could have something to read when they pooped on the toilet so it stank mashed potatoes with spinach but who comes up with the idea to make a movie today in the beginning of the second millennium which is about a soldier from the 40s waking up from a coma after several years only to discover that the hulk ironman and some damn archer wants to fight gangsters and monsters with him and not to forget a god from another planet with a big hammer so whats the plot exactly what is this movie about more than that all these famous cartoon characters meet each other and its epic for the win apparently that they are going to stop the mischievous loki and his alien army from enslaving humanity wow that sounds almost as exciting as if scrooge mcduck built a large magnet which robbed humanity of all the money in the world and the were forced to team up with donald duck and his nephews a movies like that would break the roof on box office in no time because thats what its all about to make money and sell more toys to children if you want to see animated characters get together you might as well see the jetsons meet the flintstones or house of mouse insteadthis is the worst and most embarrassing movie ive ever seenseeing this movie was as disgusting as eating at mcdonalds after a long road trip filled with vomit and radio music those of you who appreciate this kind of movies might as well play pocket pool with candy in your mouths disgusting,fantasy
the was an okay movie i heard so much hype about the and i didnt think it was amazing it was an okay film not really terrible and it wasnt amazing it was okay the acting was okay but the effects were pretty good actually but because it was in 3d i would say it deserves an acadamy award for best sound effects not best actingevery body is saying best film of the year you cant just say that right away the only film you can say the best film of the year is the mario puzos the godfather i liked the way that they put most of marvels super heros into one movie but only one villain there should have been more villains in the film in summary the was an ok film,fantasy
how i would love to have championed joss whedon for this but alas nothe is not a great movie is a boring movieok i saw it in 3d the only other film ive seen in 3d was avatar and  this may also indicate to you im not a movie snoot  i rather thought avatar was ok unlike many who say its awful you would be right therefore to infer that the novelty of 3d hasnt exactly had a chance to wear thin on me yetlets just get the 3d out of the way for me it was like watching a holographic projection very unreal often there were only 2 maybe just 3 planes of focus and sometimes this made the focus too oddly focused eg a wobbling briefcase in the foreground that looked like something out of toy story also some of the action with johanssen is frantic cgi cartoony acrobatics and in 3d this just looks even more of a mess anything but exciting i was cautioned not to see in 3d  that person was right the print isnt compensated for by the darkening effect of the glasses i think it affected me too eyefatigue plus the combination of how those glasses make the film so dark plus a major major flaw in the film caused me to give up on consciousness and spare my eyeballs more than onceyes in 3d at least this film is too dark to see whats going on detail becomes elusive and the 3d focus only allows you to see one or two parts of the screen  everything else is often deliberately way outoffocus this makes the film visually uninteresting especially for us autistic background viewers and the major major flaw oh i might have already let that slip this movie is boring surely i cant be so bored that easily by a film ive never seen before its impossible yes theres some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me yaaaawwn honestly i was expecting to enjoy the especially since i kinda liked the thor movie nothing to do with portman who does very little for me and also my total nonappreciation for the goes against what id hoped that i could say something great about this film and be able to champion joss whedon for a new era of scifi movies serenity was good very good  albeit with forgivably tvmovie quality unfortunately it seems budget wasnt the limiting factor and ive now lost interestduncan jones do you hear,fantasy
i can describe the film as epicthis is by far the best movie from marvel studios whedon made an impeccable job while working on this its not very often to see the heroes youve seen before individually join together in a single film and thats what make the unique whedon made a perfect assemble with an interesting plot full of action making it one of the best superhero movies ever madethe plot is really original mixing the comic book stories with reality and make it clever and fresh with a well chosen strong cast that make you feel as they were real superheroes and i would like to congratulate mark ruffalo that makes an excellent job as bruce banner  it really fits for the role in my opinion the best hulk evervisually the film is a feast the eyes with high tech special effects and a well done cgi work as for the score it works and make the action scenes very epic again i would like to congratulate the special effects crew for the iron man suit an specially for making the most realistic hulk to date 3d isnt the best but works well finally the is an epic superhero sack of fun that will entertain everyone in the family i cant wait wait to buy it on bluray,fantasy
for the past four years marvel studios has been building a cinematic mythology based on their comic books for the first time combining different franchises into a single canonical movieuniverse starting in 2008 with iron man and the incredible hulk to 2010s iron man 2 and finally last years thor and captain america there have been five films building in anticipation to this result the ultimate crossover experience in addition to those four heroes we are also given black widow hawkeye and nick fury bringing our team of heroes to about seven although fury isnt a direct player so i suppose the team stands at sixthis movie had a lot to live up toit succeeded by god this was an awesome moviedirected and cowritten by joss whedon 2012s the is perfect payoff for fans who have been anticipating this film for over four years nowbeginning with fury samuel l jackson arriving at a shield hq the tesseract the asgard artifact used by red skull in last years captain america which has been under lockdown for testing opens a portal allowing loki tom hiddleston the outcast brother of thor to arrive on earth he steals the tesseract and uses his powers to brainwash several shield members including hawkeye portrayed by jeremy renner it is revealed that loki needs to the tesseract to open a portal to allow an alien race to invade and conquer earthrealizing they are in over their heads fury calls out to unite the three earthly heroes tony starkiron man robert downey jr bruce bannerhulk mark ruffalo and steve rogerscaptain america chris evans after the team apprehends loki his brother thor chris hemsworth is sent back to earth completing our teamwhen loki escapes and is finally able to open the portal the four heroes joined by scarlet johansson as black widow and a redeemed hawkeye must band together despite their differences to defend the world in an ultimate battlethe acting in this film is outstanding this really begins with our four leads there is no need to speak about downey he continues to play the role to perfection hemsworth and evans also are given a lot of good material to work with in particular evans who gives the character of steve rogers subtle pain and pathos this time around despite having to be strong but the real revelation is mark ruffalo as bruce banner i thought both eric bana and edward norton had given fine firstclass performances particularly norton who really made the role his own in a big way but ruffalo surprisingly blows them both out of the water he makes the role of bruce banner and the hulk thanks to motioncapture technology his own giving him humor and an incredible depth ruffalo is owed his own hulk movie nowin addition the supporting performances are incredible the gorgeous johansson is given a lot more to do in this film and she breaths a great life into black widow to be honest black widow was at times more compelling than our four leads and johansson proves once again to be a phenomenal actress clark gregg reprises his iron man and thor role as shield agent phil coulson and provides some great comedic moments in addition to being the shady government type hiddleston is menacing and dark as loki stellan skarsgard and gwenyth paltrow return in small roles as erik selvig and pepper potts and although their scenes are minor both ground the film emotionally the only slight problem i had was with jeremy renner as hawkeye i will say he gave a fine performance but his role seemed somewhat underwritten in comparison with everyone else he felt a little too expendable a character and shoehorned in but renner was still good in the rolethe script by whedon from a story he cowrote with zak penn is tight concise and an absolute blast there is a lot of humor and i do mean a lot and a ton of action although it never feels forced contrived or unneeded as fantastical as the story is it is grounded in its own sort of reality and logic and feels natural this is an extremely wellwritten fun and generally lighthearted filmthe visuals are a blast whedons direction and camera placement is fun kinetic and serves as a good companion piece to the other four directors who had previously helmed the individual films the effects are outstanding the sound design is great the score by alan silvestri is fun and memorablethis is just a competently made film and a darnedfine piece of entertainmenti will say that this isnt necessarily the best film in the series i think the first iron man felt a tad more fresh and unique but this is still an absolute blast and you cannot afford to miss it on the big screeni give the a nearperfect 9 out of 10 assemble in line at the cinema and see it now,fantasy
as awesome as expected an immense lineupcasting decent story and visuals that put transformers blur to shame iron man does take a fair chunk of the limelight as expected it felt like this was his third film before that has even been released but the others do get their fair share and have great entrancesohthe movie is very funny iron man starts off initially but hulk sees to it that he gets the last laugh and his latter scenes do dominate the tail end mark ruffalo does a pretty decent job jeremy renner as hawkeye seen briefly in thor makes olivers green arrow from dc look pathetic this movie along with his role in mission impossible 4 is definitely a precursor to his taking over the role as bourne and hes pumping up for that toospeaking of the muscles in the film cap appears to have lost weight chris evans must not be working out as much but thor seems to have taken over in the gym as hes even bigger hulk is obviously the biggest but thats what cgi does for you oh and iron man appears bulkier like his suit needs to compete scarlett johannssons ass gets a cameo in this film i wonder how she felt about the cameras angle in all the 3d glory in one sceneanother new member to the cast and good to see another regular  agent maria hill appears played by a very fit looking cobie smulders robin from how i met your mother fame she gets a fair chunk of the movie and action herself stellan skarsgaard returns from thor along with the villain most would have seen in the trailer loki potts  coulson cameothe one on one battles of many of the heroes is a sight to behold and are really a delight to watch you get to see them throw everything at each other as you see them match up their strengths and their weaknesses also watch for the cap  iron man combo towards the end of the film memories from the past loved the film will no doubt be seeing it again check it out,fantasy
everybody take note the superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two in fact someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is joss whedon for those of you who dont know who this man is hes been around a while but not as famous as other directors first and foremost he is a writer we have him to thank for films like toy story titan ae atlantis and alien resurrection he is also the writing and directing genius behind tv shows like buffy the vampire slayer angel dollhouse and the short lived firefy among others and he is no stranger to directing big action movies he helmed the firefly spin off movie serenity but this is whedons first big feature film its also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this filmthe is a long time coming there have been numerous directors attached to it a number of scripts and of course six other films preceding it i am including the original hulk making it work has been no easy task each character has their own successful film franchise thor 2 and captain america 2 and iron man 3 are due out in the next two years with plots subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short endofcredits scenes involving nick fury and the initiativein the first issue of the comic  the team are assembled to fight thors brother loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the hulk onto a part of destruction whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities and egos and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appealthe story is over the top but not enough that you find yourself scoffing the reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds aliens and magic and considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway the beauty in whedons script is that it never once takes itself seriously spoiler even when sheilds supersized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress nick fury states lets dance as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirrorball rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye over the top hell yes the first act sees the assembly of the the cap and bruce banner are asked to find loki and the tesseract he has stolen from shield later thor and iron man join the team with hawkeye and black widow what works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together each thinks they will save the day but as their egos compete against one another for attention the typical alphamale muchoness comes to the fore causing disunity and damage  a lot of damageit is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of loki and his alien armythe script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust fan boys with comic book adaptions whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films there are plenty of references to the prequels and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite it is film is funny very funny the hulk almost steals the show spoiler when he throws loki around like a ragdoll during his i am a god speech but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular at times i thought i was in transformers dark of the moon considering the scale and grandeur of the films final act  the near destruction of new york although there are hallmarks to dotm is nothing like it in fact whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences action explosions while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense but doesnt get lost in the enormity and scale of it allthe production flawlessly merges cgi and live action together but the 3d conversion leaves little to be desired considering the success of tron legacy i am surprised disney who owns marvel didnt pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3di have long appreciated whedons film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in serenity those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here but not overdone he also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames which many fans will appreciate but most will missthe proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working withthis is the best comic book  superhero  film i have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by,fantasy
with most movies i dislike i can see why others might like them this is a movie that i honest to god cant see why anybody likes it its dumb the characters are bland the story is in consistent and to put it bluntly i was board for the entire film i was tapping my foot waiting for it to just end maybe i just dont like this movie for subjective reasons but none the less this movie just feels like it put everything that was kinda cool in other superhero movies into a blender and hit mix410,fantasy
joss wheddon cant direct wish jhon favreau had been given the creative freedom he requestedit makes xmen the last stand look good which is not a good complimentthe cast is good but the dialogue is terrible interactions between characters are bad people dont talk like real people somehow all feel out of character they talk like people throwing jokes to an audience which is painfully awkward to watch dangerously close to self parody territory i refuse to believe parts of the movie happenedfails on having a plot of its own also fails as a sequel to the previous movies and if you were doing a marathon i would tell you to skip this as somehow despite featuring so many characters the plot is irrelevant to all of them half characters are portrayals is inconsistent to the previous movies hulk has new actor and personality the character is so rebooted it doesnt even feels like it happens in the same cannon as the hulk movie loki goes from trying to become king by deceiving thor out of asgard to making a genocidal killing spree on earth how does killing people on earth helps him to become king asgard answer it doesnt thor is told his brother kills people he says his bro is adopted thats just awful dialogue if thor takes it as a joke how am i supposed to take the movie seriously theres no emotional conflict captain america its just there but never does anything ironman starts as a douche and by the end isnt for the third time the same transformation he experienced on ironman 1 and also on ironman 2  the arrow guy is brainwashed so he never really gets to talk and the girl is a generic though token girl that never gets developedsomehow the army on the climax looks cgi paper weight they dont even put up a fight makes it seem like even a normal civilian could hit and destroy them with such a weak evil army why even bother in the first place theres no twist no stakes never anything feels at risk the heroes have the upper hand through the whole movie they win without never ever making any effort the action is disappointing because its just stupid hits no stunts no creative fight set piecesthe dark knight deserved the oscar nomination given to this film ironman armor and hulk look good but the cgi army looks fake generic awfulif you watch it might entertain you but movie is awful if this becomes the future of superhero movies then the genre might die soon feel free to disagree but i think its so overrated i do sadly think disney paid critics,fantasy

spoiler alert  do not read on if you have not seen the filmso last night i attended the australian premiere of the and yes this was the most entertaining and impressively thorsome movie that ive ever seen like most comic book fans i was looking forward to this since nick furys appearance at the end of iron man so there was great hype and expectation this movie is the epitome of a comic book being brought to life  the action scenes were surreal the emotional content was tranquil and somehow joss whedon managed to add in a mere perfect story line and a charade of comedic lines for each of the amazing characterssublime performances were put in by all the main actors but special mentions must go to mark ruffalo who in my opinion played the perfect bruce banner i was never a fan of edward norton  sorry and tom hiddleston whos loki was devastatingly cruel and yet charming in the same manner in the case of banner ruffalo portrays him in such a way that we are reminded that there is a darker more sinister side to this man than the calm and reserved doctor in the room of course robert downey jrs presence is always felt on screen and nothing changes in this movie as he delivers most of the hilarious dialogue at one point he even recited shakespeare while fighting thor in the forest there is not one single dull or wasted scene in this movie every single one has its purpose whether it be filled with witty dialogue or explosive action an example of the aforementioned dialogue thor loki is beyond reason but he is my brother black widow your brother just killed 80 people in the last two days thorhes adopted at which point everyone in the cinema erupted with laughter of course my favorite was thor who engaged in an intense battle with the hulk on board the helicarrieressentially the takes us on a roller coaster ride through emotional highs and lows of all the characters one of the interesting components was seeing how members of the team would react when they were in the same room and the portrayal of ego clashes did not disappoint spoiler alert it takes a while for the dynamics of the to settle catalyzed by the death of agent coulson but once they assemble the ending action sequence is simply aweinspiring the hulk proves there is nothing he cannot smash including loki chris hemsworths thor gave most of the audience a massive thorgasm by summoning all that thunder and lightning from mjolnir captain americanblack widowhawkeye more than hold their own against a formidable foe and robert downey jrs iron man steals the show by proving that he is a team player and sacrificing himself to nuke the portal of the chitauri and what movie would be complete with that circling camera shot of the team preparing for battle while standing in a back to back formation with iron man initially hovering over them the background music made that moment perfect if i did have one complaint it would be the lack of background narrative showing how thor returns to earth although loki does deduce that odin must have conjured dark magic for thor to return however the midcredits scene was mindblowing revealing thanos as the mastermind behind lokis invasion and setting up a possible storyline for the 2 in conclusion this was one of if not the best movies that i have ever seen thanks for reading and enjoy the movie ,fantasy
not much to say about this one that hasnt been said millions of times before brilliant comicbased movie that is for me personally the second best marvel movie ever made right behind howard the duck kidding kidding the first iron man film obviously joss whedon further proves as if any more evidence was needed that as a writerdirector hes amongst the top of his field this is also the best hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films bruce banner is the stand out but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments save for hawkever whom is woefully underused and i hope his role is a tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cutbut really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between loved this film,fantasy
everything has converged perfectly delivering what is now the new king of the genre the is certainly the best overall comic adaptation film ever made really how could it not be they positioned this thing with five other set up films that were each remarkable in their own right not only does it all come together but im happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way believe it or not every single character featured previously in those five films gets time to really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie even though the set up has been epic the result was anything but assured it would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character together and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly maybe its because the characters themselves are complex and intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care whatever the case everyone hits a home run here they fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that have made those other five films good if you define those films as good then youll define as great its a unified step up and i didnt think that possible whats also amazing is that i think this movie works without having seen any of those other films then the fun factor will be enjoyed by those that didnt care about the other movies the depth and amazement will come from those that have invested in to this universe what theyve done is transcend any other of this genres films by going deeper and doing so in spectacular fashion with oscar caliber performances again easily the new king of the genre,fantasy
when i saw previews and commercials for this movie i got really excited i was a big fan of the old 70s lou ferrigno incredible hulk show i loved ang lees 2003 hulk and the 2008 hulk so i knew hulk would make a big impact on everyone who saw tony stark was just flat out hilarious 2011s captain america the first avenger was not the greatest marvel movie i still liked cap america but i just thought it was too in the 40s kind of boring i loved the thor movie because there was great fun action in almost every scene like the the tops every marvel movie ive ever seen and i cant wait for the september 25th bluraydvd release i love the it might be hard for the dark knight rises to top this film,fantasy
this movie is the work ive ever seen im not kidding after this i dont want to see any more films in my entire life i have seen everything that can be possible in a film mindblowing fantastic thrilling funny excellent marvel has done something no one else have ever done before putting together all these different superheroes in one fantastic franchise and making it work wonderfully it might seen a little overpowered but the feeling you get watching all of these personalities fight together makes it work marvel have actually made me do something ive never done before write a review kind of on imdb and you have got to deliver for me to do that kind of things just the best movie ive ever seen 1010,fantasy
amazing would be a one word review for this moviei went on to the cinema yesterday and was excited enough to have watched the trailers more than 30 to 40 times and was thinking how would marvel  joss whedon contain any of these characters in such a short story last for about 142 min when each of them were brilliant enough to grip me in 130150 minutes of their own in iron man 1  2 thor captain america but mr whedon knew what he wanted from the story and has clearly demarcated his territorythis has to be the best superhero movie till date robert downey jr iron man  stark has been ecstatic in his own witty and superb dialogue delivery chris hemsworth thor is well strong and manly chris evans captain america has acted like a true captain specially at the latter part of the movie and between all the action and a surprise hulk has smashed everything and has been fun too for a delightful change i really think mark ruffalo the hulk is the key ingredient which would make people jump on their seats and has added to the fun and excitement to this amazing roller coaster of a moviei delightfully give this a 10 out of 10 i hope there was a 11 possible for allowing me to witness a 2 and a half hour roller coaster without a breakwatch it if you want to know how superhero movies should be,fantasy
so they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own they dont exactly get along or have much appreciation for each other to begin with but this is what makes this film work this has been a long time lead up starting back in 2008 with iron man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together it has been a hugely lucrative series for marvel sometimes good and other times not so good it has all been leading to this pointfor me the picks out of these previous films are iron man and thor with the hulk behind that and then right at the bottom captain america iron man was fantastically fun with tony stark robert downey jnr the larger than life character who has it all he is smart witty funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do his toys with a great visionary director in jon favreau at the helm both the iron man films were extremely enjoyable thor had a great cast in chris hemsworth natalie portman anthony hopkins and tom hiddleston kenneth branagh really captured the fun and excitement of the story the second attempt at the hulk was quite good but norton as much as i love him was not quite the right choice the cgi hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the furniture captain american as a movie didnt work for me there was not enough about him to keep me interested not enough fun had i love chris evans and thought he was the right choice but with a fairly dull script and a much too serious approach i was quite bored by the endnow the question was always going to be can they work as a group with the much needed change of bruce bana to mark rufallo and a few additional characters thrown in the answer is a gigantic yes joss wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune it is always the toughest element in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed it is none of the above and on the contrary it is in its entirety exceptionally well balanced the banter between the characters is priceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background scenes everyone is extremely good but the newcomer mark rufallo shines as bruce bana and the other guy the special effects for the hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings with the cgi sorted and the right actor behind the green monster he seriously works and almost steels the show not quite but he certainly steels any scenes he is in downey jnr as stark is his usual witty charming self and sets the banter off with great timing and finesse newcomers to the series in black widow played by the luscious scarlett johansson and hawkeye played by the always solid jeremy renner are both commendable additions and both fit in marvelously tom hiddleston as loku the villain of this story plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise and respect for this outingthe special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous joss whedon has definitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself he shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material and this really is the whole point where chistopher nolan has brilliantly turned batman into a dark knight whedon constantly lightens the mood which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work there is never a dull moment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way this really is a perfectly made comic book adaptationsmart witty funny and hugely entertaining this action packed joyride is brimming with different personalities huge egos and awesome super powers they work together perfectly in this marvel from marvel go joss filmnotioncom,fantasy
with a simple plot each character gets to shine brilliantly and despite all the previews theres still plenty of wit and action to keep you grinning from beginning to end its an incredible feat that joss and all the team have pulled this movie off theres one very minor little criticism where two scenes noticeably seemed to cut off the characters heads that said ive just seen this film in 2d and i will be going again to see it in 3d brilliant ps im totally in love with the hulkswoon hopefully this heralds a new hulk movie headed by ruffalo and an action intensity following on from the that was lacking from the first two attempts,fantasy
this movie is pure garbage scarlet j is a really bad actress you can take this movie and leave only the battle scene and delete the other and it will be ok you have the same argument that transformers movie a cube with powers to control the universe two sides fighting the good and the evil the good winsno surprises i prefer watchmen capitan america is a really weak super hero boring boring boring i felt asleep all the first hour of the movie i want my money back also the alienssoldiers are not so good iron man was ok nick fury regular the air battleship was useless i really did not understand why they dont sent that huge battleship to fight the aliens,fantasy
this movie is for people who cant grow up there are no smart moves only pure special effects with no meaning behind a complete joke this explains why there are so many 40 yo men living like children out there like a man in a much better film said god  it an entire generation pumping gas waiting tables slaves with white collars advertising has us chasing cars and clothes working jobs we hate so we can buy  we dont need were the middle children of history man no purpose or place we have no great war no great depression our great wars a spiritual war our great depression is our lives think about it do you really want to have fun with this nonsense entertainment without thinking even for a second,fantasy
the has been in development for years ever since i saw iron man for the first time and saw that after credits sequence for the first time i knew something huge was about to happen now four years later it is finally happening marvel brought together iron man captain america thor the incredible hulk black widow and hawkeye to form the the film is written and directed by joss whedon who is known to be a legend with tv shows like buffy the vampire slayer firefly angel and dollhouse now this has been my most anticipated film of 2012 for a long time and every trailer has gotten me more pumped than the previous one well i finally saw it at the new york imax 3d fan screening one of 10 that was being held across the country and i have to say that i may make some bold statements in this review but i fully believe in them the is gonna be a really tough film to beat for not just the best superhero film of the year but the best film of the year in generali really have nothing but praise for the its everything that i wanted it to be and more after four years of following iron man the incredible hulk thor and captain america marvel and joss whedon brought everything full circle for whats sure to be a critical and financial success its funny emotional a visual spectacle and just everything that makes a perfect superhero movie i cannot wait to go see it again on may 4thoverall i give the an a,fantasy
reading the other reviews it seems everyone is quite excited about this movie let me start by saying that yes its awesome to look at its cool to have all those characters together on screen and the movie definitely doesnt lack actionthe reason im not giving 8 stars is the story  or lack thereof considering that joss whedon wrote this i have to say im quite disappointed by the result the movie was predictable right from the start and in spite of the abundance of actionsequences failed to really catch my attentionim not saying this is a waste of time but considering the majority of reviews here on imdb i just wanted to add my grain of salt for those pondering what to watch this evening feel free to like pronouncing it helpful i think this review if you agree,fantasy
the first of all is a good movie while sometimes overlong its entertaining and the action scenes are amazing however it doesnt have enough depth to be another one of those classic superhero films the reputation instead should be enjoyable superhero flick first off if an effort is made to assemble all of marvels that effort must be made with a little more success than this the ends up feeling like more sequel than spinoff instead of studying and developing each character if were supposed to care about all these superheroesgive them noticeable differences more display of emotions and a distinctive background just because theyre superheroes who have some funny oneliners doesnt mean the viewers will automatically think theyre the best people who ever lived in other words the characters have too little depth something that bugs me is that a few people have been saying this is better than christopher nolans batman trilogy yet the latter is a perfect example of a series of films that have greatly influenced and perhaps even transcended the superhero genre in the dark knight there wasnt a single character who was just there for nothing meanwhile loki is an uninteresting villain and doesnt hold a candle to heath ledgers disturbing brilliant portrayal of the joker who on the other hand actually seems like a villain even when hes just not doing anything how come the all have to work to defeat loki and his army while hulk can simply toss him around like a plastic spoon that said the long action sequence where the assembled all defeat lokis army is quite outstanding and many detractors of this film admit that this is also the best part it contains amazing cinematography like a minutelong shot that steadily observes each avenger and sees how theyre doing with the aliens of course the rest of the action scenes are also topnotch considering theres fighting for most of the movie the sequence with black widow running away from the hulk is especially memorable and displays arguably the most likable avenger here along with iron man the two that we care the most aboutoverall id say that the could have been cut about 2030 minutes short to flow more as a superhero film i had hoped for more character development since there were so many characters to pay attention to i loved the action and was pleased with the clever action scenes especially the last 40 minutes and the parts with black widow its undeniably entertaining and while its not transcendent and genius its a great popcornflick would i see it again yes but not my 1 priority,fantasy
at this point the has made around 100 trillion dollars or soand so its obvious that people love the film my own daughter went to the premier in new york and then went to it on opening night in general releaseand was mad i didnt take her with me tonight to see it obviously she loved the film as well as for me i liked it but didnt quite share the overall exuberance for the film mind you i liked itbut i think i preferred the earlier films before the team was formed there was a certain charm that i didnt quite see recaptured in the film now the film is goodits just that what i like in these other films i would have liked more of in the specifically the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development when i read the imdb trivia it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutesall showing steve rogers captain america trying to adjust to his new life i would have loved seeing all thisand less of the huge battle at the end of the film for me it just felt numbing after a while and i would have liked more of the characters when they werent fighting again however i did like the filmbut the earlier marveldisney films i liked just a bit better just my two cents worth,fantasy
first thing first that movie is good and yes it is just good not great best movie ever or something else it was just good good action good acting but man the story was way too much clich a bad guy wants to take down the earth and heroes have to save the earth and they win thats it loki was nothing memorable as a villain good but not great again marvel is so great for that its building up the hype and excitement of all the fans its been since the first iron man movie were waiting for that one big movie and marvel knew that the fans will never dare to realize how just good and basic the movie really is i enjoyed the first iron man movie way much than this and i speak as a huge comic fan i was looking forward to this movie but i wasnt dying of impatience like all the fans who overrated it 87 seriously what made the movie was only the characters because you really care for them and they were more comic book accurate than ever but thats it it was funny entertaining had great characters but this is way too much overrated by die hard fans who cant face the truth it deserves a solid 6 out of 10 its good but not great puny god,fantasy
the one of the most hyped comic book movies of all time after years of buildup with solo movies the is born is it good does it still hold up the answer is no i admit the first time i saw this movie in theaters i was having a blast and enjoying it very much however the film gets worse for me each time i give it a second watch the film is centered around lokiplayed by tom hiddleston who wants to take over the world while the work out their ways to stop him it is as generic and lazy as it sounds the film barely has any story or even character developmentinteraction its nothing but one liners and action none of the characters have a defined personality tony stark is a one dimensional clown thor is has the charm of a wood that speaks in a shakespearean way black widow and hawkeye are nearly the same only their gender are different hulk has his moments and captain america is one of the most boring comic book characters i have ever seen in this movie its basically a michael bay movie minus the women objectifying but same level of obnoxious and out dated film making one of the most overrated trash movies i have ever seen this movie gets 310 from me,fantasy
take a dozen writers and a dozen directors keep each in the dark refuse to allow any of them to talk to one another then have an intern collate all the scripts and hand a part of the script to each director after each director has shot his or her portion hand those portions to other interns and have them splice it together to make a film and try to convince the public that it is a unified film it has too many story lines with far too much going on i was almost cheering for the villains to win as i cared nothing for any of the heroes and yes i understand the concept of the flawed marvel hero it dragged more than ru paul and had more holes than swiss cheese i could almost predict the dialog and the plot turning points dull dull dull im a fan of all of the characters and this film destroyed any greatness that they had it all comes down to a script its like building a skyscraper on quicksandsome of the special effects were cool but thats not worth the price of admission,fantasy
my view on this movie is very simple this movie is kind of a sequel to other marvel movies is a movie that brings 4 marvel heroes together and they combine their supernatural powers to defeat the enemy to get full effect of this movie the viewer must have watched 23 of the characters movies separately to get a view of the character and what their powers are i would recommend this movie to all age groups its a movie the family will love on a friday night out i would also say this film is a feel good film this is because as the ending of the movie turns out so well the stress of the dilemma in the movie calms down at the end and leaves a triumph feeling at the end this movie would not be recommended to people who dont enjoy a fantasy theme but it would be recommended to people who understand the powers they have my opinion of this movie is that it is one of the best films i have seenive seen a lot of movies it is also a movie that can be watched over and over again i dont have complaints about this movie other than its a very fast pace movie i would recommend you all to see it in 3d or if youve missed it at the movies to buy it and make the most out of it because movies like these dont come around a lothope i helped my regards to all yash ahmed,fantasy
after reading many very positive reviews about this movie i thought i had to watch it after watching most surprising to me was that the movie didnt surprise a single moment it wasnt interesting at all fell asleep at least 3 times while watching it in fact these moments of sleep half sleep are the moments i will remember best when thinking back of the i like looking at movies a lot and can enjoy very different genres and qualities but falling asleep while watching is something i usually dont or cannot do so this movie especially in its genre must be a complete failure what do i remember after a few days a bad guy that really wasnt scary some super heroes that had to fight together to stop that bad guy and some more i guess some images of them being on a space ship and thats it thats all what about the end im sure i was awake at that moment of time but i simply cant remember it could have only been the heroes winning the battle but how and where i think they saved the earth and have been trying hard to do so but at least it happened without any unexpected or original idea so for this movie there is even no chance of writing a review that contains spoilers what could possibly be there to spoil that one guy turns big angry and greenthe is just a super flat super clich super boring super hero movie cant recommend to watch it,fantasy
marvel did a outstanding job on the i think you will enjoy this movie full of action this is a outstanding imax 3d movie it is a perfect summer film it is the best movie of all times it is a perfect family film i hope you enjoy this number 1 movie of all times this is a must see movie for sure i think you will say wow and lets go see that again but you may want to get your tickets adv because it has been a sold out movie on all of the days it has been out i think you will enjoy this blockbuster hit the is a must see movie in imax 3d or real d 3d it is a movie that you dont want to miss for sure it is action packed the whole way through the guy who plays the hulk did a outstanding job same thing with thor and iron man you just have to go see this one of a kind movie that is a hit i never saw a movie this good before in my whole life you just have to watch this amazing film in imax 3d if you like marvel movies than you will enjoy this amazing film movie i like this movie a lot and i hope you enjoy it too,fantasy
i saw this movie and it blew away my mind the 25 hour sit wasnt long enough i wanted more mark ruffalo playing bruce banner was best i have seen so far and seeing the hulk smashing thor into a building just after a heavy fight against the aliens was pure win and made my eyes tear of laughter than loki saying something and gets interrupted by the hulk who smashes loki into the ground afterwards saying puny god was another exact replica off the comic book hero i so love and enjoy just seeing this in that movie made the movie 8 out of 10 the two extra stars was cause the rest of the movie was just brilliantly put together with the mayhem the jokes the storyline the depths of most characters yes i know people wanted to see more depths in the storyline but come on you got 6 with all different stories the villains who have there story and you need to make a movie that isnt to long to let it stretch to much but still contain every ingredient to make it a good movie no not a good movie an excellent movie like a true superhero movie should be dont compare this movie to other superhero movies there you only have 1 character and 1 villain to explain and rest is story compare this when you saw the previous story lines of the main characters so watch iron man 1 and 2 and the incredible hulk with edward norton not as good as mark ruffalo but you will know the background better for the and thor and captain america first you will have enough knowledge to see this movie and rate it excellent dont go here to expect a high intelligence movie or rate it with the dark knight who was good but stand alone and dc comics not marvel different studios different styles im waiting for the dark knight rises cause i love those movies as well and the comics and hulk and batman are my two out of three most favorite heroes sorry spidey but your first real good movie has yet to come this movie was awesome and had everything thank you josh whedon for displaying the characters as if they were straight out of the comic thank you for this joy in my life ,fantasy
i heard people call the a tour de force a perfect boxoffice bonanza the wickedest ride of their lives and best movie ever i can only assume that every single one of them is a comic book freak and are all obsessed by every marvel hero and villain i can tell you im a movie buff but im not a comic book freak in my opinion that shouldnt matter because dark knight for instance is one of my favorite movies of all time i know its not from marvel but dc comics but i also liked the first iron man movie he turned into a narcissistic bastard after the first and i didnt like that character development so im not gonna write a movie of just because im not a huge marvel fan but after 2 12 hours of sitting through the deluge of explosions witty banter and generic storytelling i was happy the movie ended all around me there were people applauding and telling each other what an awesome movie they just saw my plan was just to go home and put on a real movie with plot twists and character development both things i missed in the you could say its fast paced but if the story doesnt grab you by the balls its all irrelevant the only thing the movie had going for itself was that it was hilarious to bad it didnt mean to be i knew after five minutes that the movie wasnt going to live up to the hype and it was only downhill from there to be honest the last sequence was the worst in my book the alien invasion was so stupid we were all wondering what was going to come through the black hole and what came to wipe out all of humanity a few hundred chitauri wow is that an invasion six got their stuff together and mobbed the floor with them that was a huge anticlimaxi think this movie is very overrated and only worth a view if youre tired and want some brainless entertainment other than that it really is only for the comic book geeks and maybe teenagers whove been brainwashed with years of asian fighting cartoons oh yeah the movie i watched when i got home was snatch,fantasy
this movie was simply 6 letters in 1 word boring why you may ask well its best to start from the beginning i was expecting a great movie featuring several different superhero in 1 screen i was so hyped that i got as many friends as i can to see it but some couldnt go so i only invited a few god the movie was so hyped that there was a huge line and i mean huge and all of those people were gonna go see the same film that i was gonna see so once i walked in and waited for almost 20 minutes for the movie to start that is when the big disappointment began such a boring introduction and lame character revilement no creativity no second thought no built up nothing feels more like an introduction to jersey shore and transformers than an actual marvel film but i got to admit the begging scene where thors brother appears reminds me of halo atleast the first one so thats pretty cool but too bad the scene itself sucked no matter what the other negatives that made this film a disappointment is the lack of any real character imitations thor brother was the prime example of this along with the childish predictable jokes you hear from them the acting and written for thors brother was pathetic and pointless that without hes mighty powers hes nothing but a wimp or the actor himself was just a wimp from the beginning he looks to be about 50 years old and doesnt resemble any appears of thor whats so ever all they do is just put on the costume and thats it so what about the clichd jokes i mentioned well there stupid childish out of place for a movie that is suppose to be quality entertainment then again it was terrible and nothing new and once you hear the first joke you will automatically know that all the jokes will be the same kind of thing threw out the whole movie i will admit that i did laugh at some moments but it struck me to be unpleasant and very lazy for a movie like this or any other in fact i was so bored and unpleased that i wanted to leave right when black widow appears cause it was so boring but i didnt cause i wouldnt want to hurt my friendss feelings that i invited them to a movie and wanted to leave once we began watching it so i stayed and watched the rest of the movie it took about half of the movie just so all of heroes can appear and an interesting note i might add is that edward norton who played as bruce banner in the incredible hulk 2008 was replaced when i was expecting him to be in it so i was disappointed with that cause he was great as bruce banner the ending climates with the and thors brother was lame as well sure some of the action is cool but some other action scence suck and it used specialsound effects from transformers and that sucks when i think of action from the i would predict it to be dragon ball z without energy waves or teleportation but no it just felt dull so what i did i really think of the movie overall well to put it short and bluntly this is what i said in my mind when the movie ended this movie sucked what a setup from marvel to disgrace such heroes that were good till this movie came out marvel must of knew that a whole bunch of marvel fanboys were gonna go see this movie cause it had their favorite heroes in one big screen not a second thought on how it will play out all they care about is whos in it wow what a waste of money and time i wasted on such a worthless movie like this first they ruined spiderman and now this what a setup thats how i really felt like when i finished watching this movie and you want to know what was the saddest part about it is a bunch of people said it was amazing and the best movie of the year b worst movie of the year you mean and worst super hero movie ive ever seen in general i recommend you all take my advice and dont waste your time on such dread cause its not worth it dont listen to what to the people who liked this movie cause theyre only saying it cause there just so depended on marvel that they think anything with their superhero will be good at this point and on i dont really like marvel at all anymore the ruined it for me time to official move on to dc like everyone else would do and the ones who havent wake up and see reality that your pointless marvel heroes are zeros my god this movie was so bad when i think about it i feel embarrassed that i sat down and really watched the whole movie and didnt leave right when i felt like going to sleep like everyone else would but i give this movie a 310 just because the beginning reminded me of halo but besides that the movie itself was so incredible boring and very unoriginal dont forget it was predictable too in fact when i was watching half of the movie i completely forget what the plot was really about another thing is that the movie feels more like a sequel to thor than actual teamed up superhero movie so dont see the but go watch the dark knight rises instead that was a far better movie than the thanks for reading and i hope you take my advice good bye your gonna need it,fantasy
boy am i in trouble because i thought it was just plain sillymaybe its because i havent seen thor because i found tom hiddleston so ludicrously miscast as loki that i couldnt maintain suspension of disbelieffirst this deity who arrives in an awesome burst of netherworld energy and carries a scepter capable of slaying whole armies has to escape sitting awkwardly in the back of a pickup truck for gods sake and then when he stands up in his silly horned costume and tells a crowd of people to kneel to him his complete lack of gravitas in the role just set me laughingi couldnt watch it after that,fantasy
i have never reviewed anything here on imdb but after watching the for the second time i just felt the need to say something very well after watching the in the cinema you dont reflect very much of the bad things its all special effects and 3d stuff going on but after watching this alone at home i just felt its not that good the story is clich as many has mentioned but i felt that there are a few things that are uncleari just cant figure out how strong are the asgardians they are supposedly demigods still the hulk threw loki around like nothing i just felt that scene was unnecessary i dont want the badguy to look so crappy i just couldnt take loki seriously he got tossed around a lot dont get me wrong i enjoy some of the humor added to this film its just sometimes its not timed right it just seems wrong to methe most annoying part about the is that the bad guys didnt stand a chance and i didnt like loki for being a bad guy again,fantasy
immediately after watching the i was confused all of my friends seemed to love it the theater roared its approval as the credits rolled and most of the reviews ive read are overwhelmingly positive for these reasons im not entirely sure i watched the same movie as everybody else but im perfectly willing to comment on what i saw the film opens with loki stealing the tesseract an all powerful energy device that poses a significant threat to earths security thankfully nick fury assembles the the group of superheroes who are the focus of the film robert downey jr chris hemsworth chris evans and mark ruffalo all reprise their roles of iron man thor captain america and the incredible hulk while scarlet johansson and jeremy renner portray the black widow and hawkeye every single one of these characters loki included is entirely onedimensional and frankly boring to watch with the possible exception of the hulk they are straightforward flawless superheroes who have absolutely no trouble dispatching anyone who crosses them this makes the prolonged action sequences particularly difficult to watch you never doubt who is going to prevail as for the central story of the film it is a complete mess its an action movie in the truest sense of the word every aspect of the plot is twisted to encourage more fighting sequences which really prevents the film from moving forward at all the story doesnt provoke further thought in any way and really just serves to provide mindless action and downright terrible dialogue in particular downey jr relentlessly delivers sarcastic insults every few minutes which just arent that funny in my opinion once or twice i found it amusing but by the end of the movie i was sick of it the other characters arent much better with the exception of thor who had a few funny moments despite everything i have said theres no criticizing how the film looks the cgi sequences are stunning and the various locations in the film are visually pleasing it doesnt break any new ground but its still entertaining overall this is not a good movie the characters are flat static uninteresting people portrayed by uninspired actors the story is atrocious and riddled with holes the action sequences are painfully long and predictable and perhaps worst of all when it was trying so hard to be funny it simply wasnt looking at all the names that contributed to this movie i am frankly shocked at the finished product joss whedon is a brilliant director and writer i loved firefly and most of the actors particularly downey jr renner and ruffalo are usually enjoyable so im not quite sure where everything went wrong but hopefully they can produce a more thoughtful sequel with their next efforts rating 410,fantasy
loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like a run through likewise the conflict and plot dont really seem to matter and there is no tension suspense or pacing each scene is on same level as the one before you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order this thing totally lacks momentum the expensive cast does well enough but the films length and onedimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing the is not particularly recommendable nothing about it is memorable or original and its not a film i feel any need to revisit its a passable time killer nothing more,fantasy
where to start me and my wife watched this movie yesterday to forget about the drama called battleship dont get me started but its hard to choose the most retarded movie between the two this one had some okay jokes in it but like many people said you dont feel any threat you dont feel any story you just see special effects and uhmerica f yaa 2hrs straight the effects were good and the hulk smashed like he never smashed before but every movie starts sucking as soon as you realize nobody of the good guys can actually die lord of the rings anyone and when legions of 10x more badass alien monsters are killed throwing a chair at them or blindaimed headshotting them with a bow on a spaceship going 300mph you know youre just wasting your time anybody with the very least amount of selfrespect stay away from this movie how this garbage achieved to get 86 on imdb is more entertaining for me than watching that movie says a lot about imdb and what it has become compared to what it used to be,fantasy
this is worth at watch but just once the i wouldnt watch this again sure they spent a lot on effects and a grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at a movie doesnt help a weak storythis screenplay is weak  it is a overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads the weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason it just felt a bit contrived and isnt very involving dont feel for any of the charactersthere is some wit and humor from scarletts deadpan black widow and robert downeys rather lame one liners what happened to the charm of the old action hero movies,fantasy
omg scarlett johansson looks good in tight black pants ok enough of that this is as good a translation of comic book to film as any of us are likely to see  ever each of the actors chosen for the roles draws their character on like a glove and the fit is perfect this is what separates the from most other movies in this genre  the characters have depth their interaction with each other is real and eminently believable and the willful suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy this type of movie is so effortless as to be unnoticeable the cgi effects are spectacular as is to be expected and kudos to the designers for some really overthetop bad guys and hardware if i have one minor quibble it is that i wanted more from colbie smulders as agent hill her screen presence is so intense that i kept waiting and wanting more from her than to just be samuel jacksons aidedecamp ah well maybe next time,fantasy
well this was certainly a much awaited movie of this summeri had a lot of expectations from it and it delivered even moremy friend had no knowledge of and he went out with mein the end he clapped with the audiencenow about the movie just one word to explain it its entertainingits a long movie but it kept us stick to our seati dint realize when it ends the strong point of this movie is its humorevery characters are funny in their own way esp tony starkdont want to tell you the story you yourself watch itwatch it even if you are not a comic manyou will enjoy it,fantasy

could anyone imagine that the likes of iron manrobert downey jr captain americachris evans hulkmark ruffalo thorchris hemsworth black widowscarlett johansson  hawkeyejeremy renner would come together for a movie well they do in the the movie opens with a bang as lokitom hiddleston returns to earth and wreaks havoc at the shield headquarters loki steals the tesseract an energy source of unlimited potential he puts professor erik selvigstellan skarsgard  hawkeye under his control  leaves with them after the incident at the headquarters nick furysamuel l jackson decides that he has to reignite the initiative a project that had been canceled only recently in comes black widow aka natasha romanoff who starts recruiting superheroes to form the first she recruits bruce banner aka the hulk who until then had been hiding in calcutta india shield needs banner to check the potential of the tesseract the new recruit is captain america who had been frozen for quite some timethese events took place in captain america the first avenger  woke up after being in a deep slumber for seventy years after that shield recruits tony stark aka iron man thor joins the gang shortly thereafter however before the team can take on loki the heroes have to solve their personal issues  cut down their giant egos  work together as a team problematic yes iron mans sarcasm only seems to worsen the situation the way he makes fun of the others is hilarious first off i want to say something the is the best movie of the year so far be it the story the superhero vs superhero battles or the sheer epic scale of the film loki is the perfect super villain who is evil  menacing the 3d effect in this movie is just eye popping you will literally duck down every ten seconds the cinematography is brilliant the way theyve shown calcutta is authentic the battle in new york city is outstanding a note on the performances robert downey jr is spectacular as tony starkiron man iron man is my most favorite character in the film chris evans is impressive as steve rogerscaptain america mark ruffalo is outstanding as bruce bannerhulk chris hemsworth is awesome as thor scarlett johansson is great as natasha romanoffblack widow jeremy renner is effective as clint bartonhawkeye tom hiddleston is simply wicked as loki even though hes the only villain in the movie hes pulled it off superbly samuel l jackson as nick fury clark gregg as agent phil coulson cobie smulders as maria hill  stellan skarsgard as selvig are superb as well so grab your 3d glasses buy some popcorn sit back  relax as you watch the most entertaining movie in recent times dont miss this on the big screen no matter what people now lets see if the amazing spiderman or the dark knight rises top this one the bar has been set very high though,fantasy
this is an ok film there are some good things some awful but this is by far the most overrated movie of all time characters the characters are good i didnt attach to them even though i had seen lots of the other mcu movies the performances are good but nothing amazing rdj is good as iron man but i just dont like the character i didnt care about any of them and coulsons death was boring and i didnt care for the charactervillain loki was good but not great as a villain he is by far a good villain but isnt very threatening which is the main point of the villain he wasnt even a threat until the chitauri turned up and they could have been taken down by the army plot this is the main reason that this is overrated it has no plot it is very simple but still has plot holes the main threat of the movie is actually very easy to take down so the avengrrs arent needed whatsoever they could have been defeated but the army and if they were a threat to the world why didnt they even make it past one city most of the time plot holes are created by us not thinking right and using common sense but these plot holes are gigantic summary what i liked characters villain effects and action what i disliked plot music and villains army overall this is very overrated and so it gets a 5410,fantasy
the movie was shouting so loud to catch attention and it certainly did too bad it was so disappointing and shallow afterwards 3d did not entertain or maybe dragged the whole movie down even more than the sad plotfrom the beginning it was clear to me that the movie wont jump high enough and come up to my expectations all i had to do was watch the trailer and it told me how the whole movie will be  explosions dorky costumes pointless dialogs and lame jokes that recently have flooded hollywood surely when the came out and i saw the rating 88  i assumed that i was wrong such great score i just had to see this magnificent most brilliant movie ever time in the theater passed and my little sparkle died rather quickly not only did some parts could have been cut out to shorten the torture but they could have added a little bit of originality too no matter how i look at it some scenes and ideas resemble transformers 3this was not brilliant at all perhaps when overjoyed comic lovers settles down the will reach its true rating and be remembered as another common hollywoods trashas for now i can only weep for my money,fantasy
all i can say is i am stunned that this terrible movie has been given a rating above 2 or 3 by anyone and to read this film grossed over 600mm makes me lack faith in the movie public the has virtually no character development or plot it basically is non stop chase scenes and things exploding with an extreme amount of loud noise i dont think there were more than several quiet dialog times the entire movie i kept thinking that the movie would settle down and get to a meaningful story but it did not happen i even was watching it in 3d but that did not help if one wants to go see continual actions stunts and things exploding then this is the movie for you i am dismayed that so many people considered seeing this movie based on the revenues but then again i was one of the victims too,fantasy
i missed this movie when it came out at the cinema because from what i could see from the trailers and elsewhere it looked a bit silly for want of a better word kids stuff perhaps weve come to expect much more from comic book interpretations dont get me wrong i really enjoyed the iron man series spiderman and batman reboots where i draw the line i think is with characters such as thor and captain america and to a lesser extent the hulk  characters who havent dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times they just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and cooler looking characters like iron man in present day settings but anyhow having seen the high ratings the movie was getting including on here i thought maybe it cant be so bad after all and gave it a look sadly my initial instinct was right  this film is well made has great cgi and acting but its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a cgi cartoon green manmonster i realise that it wouldnt be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists but might have made for a better film thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there,fantasy
a halfarsed script and an eternity of explosions utter tripe my high point was when i fell asleep even the sight of the delightful miss johansen wasnt enough to keep my interest still it made lots of money so ive no doubt we will see a follow up it seems that this movie is in the imdb top 250 im at a loss to explain this i understand that people are fans of the comic book series i understand that this film will have its fans i just dont see it as holding any cinematic merit the acting is by the numbers and i think weve all seen enough of cgi films to last us another century if i were 12 i would probably have enjoyed it,fantasy
the 3d effects in the movie were second to none but the story consisted of mainly just conflict after conflict there was nothing truly intelligent about the plot or any of the twists it is worth watching to see the effects especially iron man flying around they did a great job of making you feel like you were in the actionim disappointed with the imdb rating and feel that the studios are now finding ways to game the ratings system by adding a bunch of paid propaganda imdb used to be my go to site but with how high this movie is rated i feel i need to find another site that is more accurate imdb used to be spot on but obviously they are selling out for ad revenue,fantasy
well how do i put this across so it doesnt sound like im trying to trash the movie ive been around since stan lee created spiderman and some of the other marvel superheroes were around even before i was born so i grew up at a time when the technology wasnt up to the task of putting what we see in todays on the big screen with that said it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak the cgi and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle so if thats what youre all about you wont be disappointed however if youre looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot youve come to the wrong movie this is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for so on that score it works but i need something more even in a superhero moviewith that out of the way there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters of all the players robert downey jr probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of iron man hes out there hes serious when he has to be and hes a wise guy when the situation warrants as for the the cgi hulk  who ever thought hed wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this he had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life the rag doll whipping on old loki tom hiddleston and the sidearm swat to thor chris hemsworth that was so outrageous it just brought the house downapart from some of the witty comic book dialog the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects exceptionally well done of course but gosh how much can a city take which by the way is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a superhero barrage when a cosmic power like loki comes to town how about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against iron man thor and hulk for destroying their city just kidding  how are you going to get them to court say i know stan lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these marvel flicks so i was glad to see he showed up here even though it was probably his quickest one ever if you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle its going to be a sad day when lee wont be around any more to make these appearancesand now for my final rant  as i write this the has in just two days made it to 31 on imdbs list of top 250 films my post will be 495 so in less than a full weekend movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between its a wonderful life and sunset boulevard doesnt it seem like theres something wrong with this picture personally if i were making the rules id allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after its come out ok maybe six months i think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system and someone like joss whedon wouldnt have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great filmsback to the  stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing flick you know theyll be there because nick fury said so thanos you think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film id bet on it,fantasy
ive always loved marvel films ever since the original spider man back in 2002 marvel to me was so much better then dc spider man was my favorite superhero and i thought he was awesome and couldnt be beat but then iron man showed up 6 years later and at the end i found out it was just a thread for an film then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called the this film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film best superhero film and so on if there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it me i could watch iron man thor hulk etc fight evil a million times over and it would never get old because stan the man lee has created something special with each character in marvel and those qualities have finally come out in this film,fantasy
my message is to vote this film down this isnt a 88 film i tried so hard to like it and then i realized it was just another blockbuster felt like the transformers with a similar end world feel but at least mr bay had the decency to bring to life a sense of need as the impending doom looms everything was handled in a nonchalant fashion sure the hulk did provide us with entertainment smash smash and that assistant who was playing games was also funny and it didnt feel contrived but for the  this is not as good ascity of god goodfellas memento se7en the usual suspects the silence of the lambs american beauty forrest gump lotr 13 lon the professional etc vote it down  vote it down  vote it down 78  81,fantasy
im a fan of marvel and i herd good things about this movie but by watching this and looking over the reviews it actually is mad true this movie was not good nor awful but boring at many at many parts of the movie the plot of the story was hard to understand of whats going on i really dont get it way this movie has high rating i mean 84 thats just rotten its should be around 45 around there this movie is sooooooo boring that the action was so cheap and yea the acting was not bad but what killed it was hardly action and superheros as well as the plot this to me is like transformers at the end when they fight the wired vilans or evil robots and robot fish lol what a joke this is so mad boring no offense but this movie is horrible its soo blahhh just rent it and dont buy unless u are a har core marvel fan i would have give a rating of 1 or 2 but the acting was the only good thing about this movie,fantasy
this movie is the definition of being overhyped hardly any aspect of it has escaped being hailed as among the best of recent years be it acting special effects fighting scenes or plot in my opinion it falls far far short of that benchmark the visual effects are very good sure but then so are the effects in battleshipthe acting isnt bad but its hardly impressive either the few impressive performances are completely overshadowed by the very average writing platitudes oneliners soundbites and trailer lines are constant much of it makes no sense at all bruce banner mark ruffalo is cautious about the other one and seems to dislike people knowing about it yet he constantly references this its as if the writers thought we havent shown banner as the hulk yet better make him allude to that in his every line so people dont forgetthe largest problem with the movie without a doubt is the plot the bad guy never feels threatening his plan is extremely inefficient and frankly stupid in many ways and the plot holes are too many to count for instance in one scene we see the hulk being a mindless beast destroying everything in his path but later we see him taking orders add to that that the superhero who apparently has the power of superaim misses whenever the script calls for it making his onscreen superpower is really good with a bow and arrow in one scene he misses half a dozen shots from a distance of 12 feeton a related note what is captain americas superpower compared to the others patriotism other are superiour in every single way ranged combat close combat mobility intelligence strength even his weapon is a worse version of thors hammer not that black widow is any better but at least she has some use in the plotthis movie is like the expendables only it takes itself seriously and has better acting it is thoroughly unimpressive and how it currently has a rank of 57 of all time movies is truly baffling,fantasy
what a well executed script perfect castedward norton couldnt make it better and awesome mix of action comedy and humor  probably the best villain in movie history loki the awesome one exciting action packed and the usual tony stark i believe when people expected the rating to be hah avenger must be a 5 what the have to go to a theatre and when you watch it and go to theatre it is absolutely as good as they it is loki is a very awesome character indeed he completes the movie with his shear charisma the armor he wears is mindblowing the hulk is an essential character as well he completes the comical aspect the black widow this smoking red hot beauty is a burst of adrenaline captain america is probably the least noticeable of all thor played a really flash in completing the storyline of loki last but not least the rockstar brought to you by acdc tony stark the witty multibillionaire playboy is the parallel equivalent to bruce wayne what can we say folks this movie could have turned out horribly or at least parly but instead it has surpassed and exceeded everyones expectation a real hollywood blockbuster,fantasy
i am a dc comics fanatic however after watching the movie i am seriously considering switching sides i got to experience this movie in matamoros mexico it is oddly strange that the movie opened a week early in different parts of the world it should have opened first in the usa before anywhere else to top it off i only paid around 650 to experience the movie in 3d and inside an imax theater here in the us tickets will cost around 1225 in a regular theaterthe exceeded all my expectations of any superheroes movie it is a movie full of action from beginning to end this movie is very close to the animated movie the but with a very pleasant twist since the acting and the filming was believable it is hard for me to choose who my favorite actor was all of them did an incredible job performing their part i do have to mention that even though the hulk was computer animated cgi it was a breath of fresh air to see him in this movie he was funny at times and also very real looking,fantasy
the movie touches on all bases that a good superhero  fantasy movie should a fantastic story line solid action good humor and amazing visualsthe story is a bit much kinda outthere literally but it is in keeping with the nature of the thor  asgard storyline you cant include a norse god without accepting some magik  fantasy elements plus the always tackled those issues in the books even the pacing was right on at no point does it get slow or bogged down in exposition bottom line it worksthe action is solid on all levels and some of it is just breathtaking even the faceoffs are surprising and fun to watch best action in a superhero movie periodthe humor  emotion the movie is hilarious without being stupid or directed at 8year olds lucas  dc comics take note you dont have to make lame childish jokes to be funny think more joker with the pencil than anything in green lantern downey jr is the driving force of this movie and his stark is turned up a notch there a some literal laughoutloud moments in there and some moments where the theater became deathly still they pull strings without making you feel like a puppetfinally visually the movie looks amazing ilm outdid themselves and the one spot im sure everyone was worried about the green one just looks sick not a lot of shakethecamera fake action but some great scenes even a few surprising choices of vantage pointsthe cast was perfect ruffalo is banner a throwback to the bixby days instantly making you forget norton or bana evans owns the cap  leader  good guy role you want to follow him johannson is a badass in her role hemsworth is good although thor is kinda onenote hawkeye is an intriguing character and renner has the same great smirky tension he had in hurt locker agent coulson has a muchexpanded role in this and his parts are special in themselves and of course downey is kingim not a huge fan never was xmen or the justice league were always my favorites so im not total fanboy but i think this movie captured every element a true comic fan would want to see on the screen and casual fans can just enjoy it as well because it stands alone as a great movie probably the best since first class maybe the best since dark knight i know i walked out feeling like i did after return of the king its that good,fantasy
a rating of 88 on imdb made me think this movie must be really fantastic but it is notweak plot boring during the first 15 hours no introduction to the characters only the end gives a bit of what i actually expected maybe it is because i am not a too huge comic fan or that i had only seen hulk and thor before which i actually really liked it was a really disappointing show also the film appeared to be very dark with the 3d glasses on and i was not the only one in the audience who had a hard time staying awake as other reviewers mentioned as well the different size of hulk in various scenes is a bit irritating overall i had expected a lot more,fantasy
as someone who has not read marvel comics has not seen the films captain america the hulk thor or iron man ii this film failed to pull me in as a standalone movie the feels like a mishmash of rapid surfacelevel character introduction and way too much action little attention is given to character development as it seems viewers are expected to come into the film with a degree of knowledge however this is not to say that i think the film would be great if i did have some knowledge of the backstory theres little in the way of a moral here or a deeper meaning as this is just a goodguysavesworld plot its one that like many superhero movies before makes me ask if character development or thought for that matter really are being extinguished by moneydriven action i wouldnt even call this a popcorn movie as i found few laughs and absolutely no connection to the characters in my experience i like action movies but i need to be drawn in to the characters in order to care about the action the didnt even try to draw me in it just said here are the heroes now watch them fight if the first hour had established some human element for the heroes i might have liked the action as it stands the audience is thrown into the arena with the invincible combatants and expected to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility i must ask  why should i care about action when one side cant lose and i havent been told otherwise why should i root for the yankees the only reason i can see is because the bad guy loki wears a ridiculous looking costume i keep attempting to find redemption in societys reception of this movie maybe thats why i hope that im just missing a big part of the backstory im a big whedon fan and came into the hoping to see some more of his magic i was rewarded with a twoandahalf hour snooze fest of cg action my only sincere hope is that the millions he makes off of this movie funds real projects of his in the future,fantasy
ive waited with baited breathe to see this movie for 4 years ever since sam jackson turned up at the end of iron man in 2008 and uttered those words that made marvel fans around the world weep happy tears im here to talk about the initiative after 5 films i can happily report that my incredibly high expectations were not even close to high enoughthe movie starts off with an introduction to each of our heroes and their antagonist loki its all pretty usual stuff from here but once the heroes come together the movie becomes something more there are a lot of big egos flying around and each one is more used to being the centre of attention especially robert downey jrs tony stark its in these heated rows and witty banter that the becomes something that i really wasnt expecting a family comedy all these characters are so different and come from such different backgrounds that there is a lot of fun to be had by bouncing them off each other the fish out of water gags at captain americas and thors expense are great easy there point break with tony getting to roll off line after line of witty insults and in the films climax hulk gets most of the laughs as he smashes everything around him the hulk could easily have been the films main weakness marvel had already tried bringing him to the screen twice with little success ang lees 2003 version being one of the most underrated superhero movies ever but he ends up being one of the films biggest strengths mark ruffalo makes a great bruce banner as he actually gets to play both banner and the hulk through motionperformance capture the first time ever that an actor has played both banner and his massive alterego and it works super well there was a huge cheer and applause when chris evans delivered the line hulk smash and hulk proceeded to do so with much gustoa few of the new characters and ones that were limited to cameos in previous films get their chance to shine here scarlett johanssons black widow gets to do more kicking looking good doing it and is given a love interest in jeremy renners unbelievably badass hawkeye samuel l jackson finally gets to spend more than 5 minutes on screen after showing up in 4 marvel movies prior to this one as a part of his massive 9 picture deal with marvel cobie smulders one can not measure her sex appeal of how i met your mother fame gets to show off her action chops as shield agent maria hill and the stan lee cameo is present of coursewhich brings us to the films action sequences they are astoundinglike transformers 3 astounding each one better than the last an early 3 player bout involving iron man and captain america try to take down thor is great but an aerial fight between thor and the hulk is better but then theres the climactic glorious war which really shows the potential of bringing this group together as they get to fight as a team the problem with them on their own as demonstrated in previous movies is that the film makers are limited to the adversaries to give their hero iron man has just been fighting other men in suits thor monsters etc but now you can throw any enemies you want at thethe plot is relatively tight and clever but the screenplay is the real hero brilliantly written with some cracking dialog joss whedons directorial style translates perfectly into the blockbuster mold the perfectly cast actors are all 100 comfortable in their roles and have great fun both bouncing off each other and uniting to fight as a team the action sequences are breathtaking and the whole movie is terrific fun without being dumb or kiddy richie in terms of where it stands in the pantheon of great comic book movies is strictly down to personal preference but in my opinion this is the second best comic book movie ever the dark knight wins out due to its better story and villain but is still one of the best action movies ever mademy one big problem with the film was the untimely murder of agent coulson clark gregg at the hands of a rampaging loki i felt like this was merely a tool to evoke an emotional response adding to his character arc from tony stark whom throughout the film mentions numerous times he wasnt even aware that agent coulson had a first name but all of a sudden feels as though he had some kind of relationship with this character i have loved every scene agent coulson has ever been involved in and i feel it was a large mistake to kill off one of the only genuinely relatable and funny human characters in the entire marvel universe perhaps in further films he will make a reappearance to collect his vintage captain america collectible cards one can only hopemake sure you stay after the credits also for those of you not in the know be ready to google thanos and the infinity gauntlet when you get homeall in all it was great fun  i honestly can not wait for whedons directorss cut a fun fact i read this afternoon involves kevin feige producer of every marvel film already having plans to incorporate spiderman and the xmen into future films once they regain the film rights to these charactersreally looking forward to more fingers crossed joss whedon keeps his diary empty for many many years to come910 well and truly assembled,fantasy
i have not bothered to write a review about a movie for a while but this one deserves it after seeing a screening of the film at madrid i can say that the is the best superhero movie ever made tm one of the reasons that make me think like this is that i didnt love all the individual films of the characterscaptain america was right thor is average but entertaining and a with an awesome casting the hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed the second iron man was awfulthis film exceeds by far the sum of its partsit is bright cheerful colorful a film by gentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys even the black widow totally plain in iron man has a great girl power whedon style role it is full of references to the readers but i swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more funof course you have some script inconsistencies and failure to apologize for cursing is a comic of gentlemen in pajamas not the regent it has both humor grateful to see the original version and i have no doubt that the dubbing staminai wanted to applaud to cheer i wish you a experience like mine with all the cinema enjoying it is an experience that reminds us that sometimes just sometimes a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by other peoplesome might say that the batman movies are better i would say they are even different genres spiderman 2 is the only superhero movie that genuinely in my humble opinion can competenobody here is going to win an oscar but that does not mean that it can not win a special place in your heartsand the postfinal after the credits  okay i expected it but here we have our final wink the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading marvel comics a subtle phrasing full of a meaning that only comic books fans will understand,fantasy
questions 1 giant robotic prehistoric whales swimming in the air 2 the nuke is the best weapon in the universe 3 every villain dies like in independence day probably because they minds were connected 4 the cube has the power to destroy the universe strongest then the big bang 5 hulk beat the st out of loki 6 the flying carrier has no radar so they attacked it with no warning 7 no us army seven  are enough for first and definitely the last view,fantasy
i really enjoyed the earlier ones but this was really dumbed downwith very little effort they could have made this a great movieyou cannot defy laws of physics in special effects or it becomes completely 5 year old cartoon nonsense that is the problem here be logical with the scenes instead of being lazy the graphics capability is there so dont cheapen it by taking short cutsit distracts from the entire moviethat and great effects mixed in with the most primitive of video overdubbing in many scenes you can plainly see the backdrop with people standing in front of it youd think you were watching a 1940s film with overdubbing  geeeshcome on do it right or dont do it at all,fantasy
actor john cusack once said that there are no more big production studios anymore there are just a bunch of banks which provide fundingcredits for projects and approve which script would be produced according to box office profit it is projected to generate  because hollywood mentality became like  more money  bigger stars  bigger budget  bigger marketing  bigger blockbuster  bigger box office income thats all it matters  since comicbook  superhero genre is the newest and biggest market to be milked in popular culture for hollywood in these harsh economy  is it surprising that the  a childish intake about a bunch of ridiculously costumed superheroes with one dimensional immature behavior getting together to repel an alien invasion  again  i think any actual alien seeing these alien invasion movies would not even close earth ever again our always winning despite odds thing would be silly to them   unfortunetely not this is another shallow seasonal product  another leave your brain at theater door movie aimed for comic con convention fans and i admit it is a big marketjust like most movies in this genre  there are a few exceptions  it has its own clichs and tropes like they are coming out of a factory assembly line at least director joss whedon  a great tv writerproducer i was a follower of firefly and dollhouse  does not deny them and recognizing what they are  wears them at movies sleeve bickering superheroes  thats fine amusing with whedonesque humor but humor got overwhelming and made superheroes childlike not multi dimensional characters   threat from outer space from a sneering arrogant enemy with another comic book costume  at least tom hiddleston performed as well as he could with material he was given  but what the hell was lokis motivation in conquering earth    his boss with a digital voice  super secret  american as usual  military spy agency  i can never understand american film industrys fetish of military  for a nation devoid of conscription   national stereotypes  russians are evil you know   hot ass kicking super agent babes  scarlett  scarlett are you so desperate    aryan looking superheroes from ww2 era  thor  captain america  blond blue eyed  with whom we were fighting with anyway in that time  did you realize that there were no other ethnicity among these heroes like oriental or latin   tony stark rich jerk  hulk a doctor bruce banner marked with tragedy  mark ruffolo is the only actor with proper character material and performs admirably in this   hawkeye with baby faced jeremy renner  i never warmed to that guy as an actor   and samuel jackson as nick fury big boss of agency with an eye patch  no fake protez in nowadays   because it looks cool  a final battle with lots of laser rays and cgi explosions without casualties in another american urban area  this year it is new york citys trashing time   good vs evil  government made the mistake of launching a nuclear missile  it is averted  heroes are victorious blah blah it is the endafter all this sequence of predictable events where no protagonist was harmed and good guys win  what do we have  an empty blockbuster which will make a big box office hit  probably a franchise but at the end an empty film i can not wait in 2030 years our grandchildren asking is this the stuff your generation was watching  no wonder everything really mattered like environment  economy  politics or simple psyche of human or society condition all of them gone hell your visual arts stopped reflecting them ,fantasy
honestly i had heard so many people say this was going to be great i think i even read some good reviews by reputable critics and i am left wondering did we see the same movie wow  what a total load of crap and i thought that battleship was going to be lemon of the year honestly battleship was better than the basically it was a sequel to thor which was crap and nobody sawthe script was shocking the acting appalling even the real actors had a hard time delivering their crappy lines thor especially was dreadful  wtf with the weird english accent hes a terrible actor so i didnt expect much  but id rather his foul australian accent than whatever he was trying to do in this movie scarlets character was also bad shes not a bad actress but her character was terrible what exactly was her superpower supposed to be anywaythe whole thing was corny cheesy and completely over the top  a flying aircraft carrier wtf by the end of the film you didnt care what happened  you just needed it to end if this movie represents what the majority of people think of as good filmmaking then surely as a species we are doomed appealing to the lowest of the lowest common denominatorsthe best part was seeing the trailers in 3d of dark knight and prometheus seriously,fantasy
anyone gave 5 to 10 stars for this absurdity who is past 18th birthday  not a comic book publisher marvel fanboy and does have a girlfriend please raise your handno one  thought so the movie is atrocious there is a plot a plus compared transformers movies but it is so simplistic and full of tropes  deuxexmachinas  i lost count how many times lokis magic staff was used to explain everything and advance story from brain washing to destroy portal opening device   stereotypes  predictability and cheap juvenile pg13 jokes it becomes a parody i wonder that was the intention self mocking with movie concept  characters  genre etc because there is no way this movie goes unpredictable or might surprise you ending credits might have said from producers of scary movie or meet the spartans final cgi explosion filled fight scene another parallel to transformers movies  against alien invaders where no one was harmed due to rating was so messy with headache inducing 3d scenery you either had to get out of theater for fresh air or close your eyes and ears  i did former  the result is box office inflated animation due to marketing hype except cgi special effects overuse it has little cinematic quality actors try to make something out of their characters but child like character material gives them little chance on thatcomic book fan boys please stop comparing your live action stuff with oscar winning material you display your ignorance and make yourselves ridiculous cinema does not revolve around you i am glad that you got your live action clip but for the rest 99 of us living on this planet who do not know know or familiar with resource material the was badly edited  predictable and sometimes cringe worthy movie and i am using movie term very lightly here,fantasy
simpleminded liveaction comic book extravaganza uniting earths resident superheroes to thwart thors adoptive brother loki and his faceless army from destroying the world the 3d effects arent terribly good though the film looks expensive and is topheavy with crushing destruction taking place in manhattan somewhat disconcerting in the post911 years coupled with blisteringly loud sound effects robert downey jr brings his usual panache to the fore as tony starkiron man and chris evans is a wonderfully wellscrubbed captain america but others in the allstar cast particularly scarlett johansson samuel l jackson mark ruffalo and in a cameo gwyneth paltrow just appear to be slumming the script by joss whedon who also directed could only be amazing and complex to comic book fans who havent been comic book fans for very long its a mechanical enterprise for audiences looking to be uplifted by the sight of buildings and people being obliteratedand the patriotic revenge therein  from ,fantasy
and that is exactly what we have with the sam peckinpah the master director of mayhem action and bloodletting who broke down these hollywood barriers in film over forty years ago recognized the necessity of character development for any action to have emotional meaning as technically welldone as the is in all the action sequences it lacks any human emotional qualities nobody but the most simpleminded that like mindless explosions and destruction will find any interest in this movie a movie is simple entertainment that will not past the test of time a film is a work of art with quality and intelligence that will endure through the years the is a 212 hour movie,fantasy
it seems like besides nolans batman and the punisher i am doomed to never appreciate the dull actionsuper hero films that seem to sweep the film world and produce millions of misguided teen action junkies this would be a gem for cinema experience of huge 200 inch tvs but there is a reason these films never gain academy awards genuine ground breaking respect aside from budget and ratings the point of this review is just an opinionated rant to quarrel with the repetitive plots and average performances that people seem to just eat up and refuse to expand fantastic cinema experience because theyre long and to them boring i can state whats boring a hero is at the height of their average power suddenly they encounter an ability or change that makes them more powerful and nearly worshiped iron man thor cpt america batman spiderman now a girl or love interest that comes along and makes them vulnerable or around the time where they become vulnerable because typically these films have to take their powers away iron man thor the hulk batman spiderman wolverine and superman now they are usually hated at this point because they cant protect the masses or their loved ones or are just in doubt if they should pick up their dusty war torn mantle iron man batman hulk and wolverine and the bad guy is defeated the girl is usually saved except poor old batman wolverine iron man spiderman the hulk do you see where i am leading too do people like watching the same stuff just wearing a different cape metaphore for the smarties out therei am a fan of kurbick tarentino del toro whoops i am a hellboy fan scorsese finch mendes aronofsky eastwood and anderson fan among others and i know the guidelines between a film for fun and a film for what is described as moving art or groundbreaking visual emotion and plot oh for a suggestion for some pretty slick action films that have earned respect try leon the professional heat bunraku and kiss kiss bang bang black comedy as well,fantasy
finally the marvel franchise reveals its coup de grace and its everything that we hoped for before i totally kiss this movies butt for a while im going to delve into the negatives firstjust a warning the first 25 minutes are a little slow which is to be expected when telling such a large story lord of the rings needed a whole movie to build up to the adventure to put it into context some of lokis dialogue is a little hard to understand at times because of the norse language dialect but thats easily fixed with second viewings other than that and some nitpicks the movie deliversthis is the movie we all made playing with our toys as a kid wheedon has done a fantastic job and i really dont think this movie couldve worked as well without him all the characters fit in this movie i never thought a conversation between loki and nick fury would work on screen but it does every character gets to shine in this movie at time its a black widow movie then an ironman movie then a thor movie then a captain america movie it all just fits perfectly this movie has the best editing ive seen all year and some of the best acting to go with it this movie is a culmination of several geek movies in one its got the ear turning and self reflection of scott pilgrim with the ensemble aspect of star trek 2009 with great dialogue im going to say character a lot because thats the focus the story is a little weak because it comes second to the characters ive always described superhero movies are character pieces with big budgets a lot of people complained that its a comedy or that its just a loud mindless movie with explosions like transformers since when does having great humor make something a comedy all the humor is in the witty dialogue and a few physical gags which are hilarious and also unique to the characters and wheedon adds lots of little subtle setups to the ending to make the movie more cohesive and smarter than it is its not a bad story its just a simple character driven one the only superhero movie i know that has more emphasis on story is the dark knight but this blows that out of the water 6 heroes are better than one thats why lord of the rings star trek and toy story are so great the team or the ensemble there are so many ways this movie couldve been ruined maybe they got the writing right and the action is choreographed well but is filmed with shaky cam or is incoherent all the action scenes in this movie are great and easy on the eyes and even have lots of character in them the best scene in this movie is when the are all arguing in a room and the acting is the greatest i still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this this movie is so much fun and if you dont like it its probably because you didnt want to so anybody with an open mind should love this 10 out of 10,fantasy
you can think im jumping on the bandwagon or whatever you want  this movie was amazing i would give it a 10 out of 10 if cobie smulders hadnt been so poorly miscast go back to ted robin you dont belong here i would be hard pressed to find anything else wrong with this moviethe best scenes are not when the are working together to fight the enemy its when theyre fighting each other  with words hilarious or with weapons bad some might say the beginning of this movie starts out too slow and there isnt enough action  id say they are dead wrong dead wrong this is a movie that doesnt insult the audience by assuming that all they want are things to go crash and boom this is a movie that cares about developing their characters and cares about an actual storyline sure theyre all superheros but theyre all also human dont worry though theres still plenty of action to go around and each of the characters in this movie pulls his and her own weightmy only piece of advice is to first see captain america iron man at least the first and thor especially thor since the entire premise of this movie is based on thors brother loki  tom hiddleston is ridiculously amazing in this movie does a good job of catching you up to speed if you havent seen these other movies or read the comic books which i admittedly havent but i would still recommend seeing thembottom line if i had the money id be paying to see this movie in the theater every day,fantasy
i love this film it is funny packed with action and story is easy to follow best set of warriors with real potential together all work together to bring down evil that is out of this world d my perfect film i love iron man i love captain america i love the hulk i love it all the film has good use of cgi it has good action scenes that no one is better than the otherthey are all good in their unique way this makes the film so unique because it packs in the best actor with a great story in a good set with every film there are problems some of these are quite obvious to the human eye firstly how does the start work the starting point was quite confusing and very different  just got me wonderingwhy this world but after you pass that the film seems to have few flaws and good parts so i definitely would recommend this to a friend or two and it would be a nice family film toomy conclusion is that it would get a suitable 910 from me i want to give it more but i just would not give it a ten not everyones film  thanks for reading and happy reviewing d,fantasy
has the global situation grown so bleak that the populace has regressed to comic books for escapism entertainment judging by the enormous popularity of everything cinematic based on superheroes and scifi extravaganzas i suppose the answer is yes to sit in one place for an excess of 2  hours and witness the destruction derby that is the apocalyptic bad guys in the form of a light spear carrying loki tom hiddleston against samuel l jacksons shield cast of makebelieve folks  robert downey jr in armor chris evans in his captain america halloween costume mark ruffalo unconvincingly transforming into the hulk chris hemsworth as hammer wielding thor scarlett johansson as a pretty black widow and jeremy renner as hawkeye all out to make life sustainable for the leasers like stellan skarsgrd clark gregg and colbie smulders  is a feat in itselffor movies of this type this one has more color and imaginative loco devices that most and therefore i suppose it remains at the top of the heap when will these characters run out of tales the answer likely is when the movie public stops ling up for these epics grady harp,fantasy
i felt compelled to review this having just seen it 2 months after its release  the wait was agonising at times but worth every second very few films have made me beam and laugh and cheer and clap so much terminator 2 batman begins iron man and a select handful of othersthe is a little bit of a slow burner but with delightful ingredients on the screen it makes for a fabulous explosive and tasty finishid have to say it was superbly orchestrated from start to finish and the highlights must go to the thoriron man scuffle and the grand finale which has  surprisingly  the hulk as its main and certainly best attraction after two average hulk films this one more than compensates for them with humour im always angry and punchiness it stopping one of the megamonsters and slapping loki around as it he were a barbie doll  awesomeother highlights are the cap telling the nypd what to do and lokis masterful interrogation by romanoffall in all the best action ive seen in a few years cannot wait for them coming up against thanos in av2,fantasy
thoughts this movie is 144 minute pure gold of amazing action humor and emotionsthis could be the best comedy of the year in my opinionoverall this is a big summer blockbuster one of my favorite movie of the year and favorite movie in general one word awesome characters are very well developed and they are well balancedacting is well done especially rdj as tony starkiron man and mark ruffalo as the new bruce bannerhulkrest of the cast did a good jobbetter then in they previous moviesaction is  breathtaking and awesome fx are better then other marvel films cgi is great and believable,fantasy
it took four years to make the by joss whedon but it was well worth the wait the story takes place in new york in 2012 the are made up of iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye  jeremy renner the main antagonist of the movie is loki tom hiddlestonthe movie is an action comedy  adventurescifi film the movie is two hours and twenty three minutes long and by the end you dont want it to be over in the beginning we find out that earth has found the tesseract an object that can provide an unlimited source of potential energy it suddenly activates and opens a portal to another world where loki comes out of loki threatens to wage war upon earth now its up to nick fury samuel l jackson to find a way to stop him he is part of an organization called shield and he brings together a team of super humans to form the to save the earth from loki and his army along the way the get into arguments which allows loki to get away loki ends up opening the portal again and his army is able to come to earth will the be able to stop loki and his army you will have to see the movie to find outi loved the acting in this movie i think thats what made the movie what it is i dont think i could choose one favorite but if i had to it would have to be between the hulk and iron man the hulk is my favorite because he is a genius when he is normal and he smashes everything when he turns into the hulk the funniest part of the movie would be when the hulk punches thor while fighting loki army the only thing i didnt like was that he only became the hulk two times throughout the entire movie iron man maybe my favorite because he is funny and cool he is funny and intelligent thought the entire movie he is funny for example when captain america asks iron man if you take off you armor what are you which iron man responds with uh genius billionaire playboy philanthropistanother thing i really liked about this movie is the story not for one second did i find the movie boring or unenjoyable i kept my eyes glued to the screen the movie has all the things a movie needs for example the movie has humor action and an amazing cast also i think all the characters have the right amount lines and everything is distributed evenly not one actor is more superior to the otherall in all i think the story was amazingly written after reading this review i bet you understand that i loved this movie everything about this movie in my opinion is perfect i would recommend everyone to see this movie and not only at home but go to the theater and see it there you will not enjoy it at home as much as you would in theaters i would give this a 1010 or a must see movie,fantasy
after years and years of anticipation we finally get to see some of our favorite superheroes meet and fight together as a team creating a movie like this is difficult considering that it would be hard to combine the different superheroes story lines and merge them into one storyline however marvel pulled that off easily by strategically releasing movies over the past four years about each of the heroes to serve as prologues and create anticipation for this amazing awesome actionpacked thein the first 45 minutes we see what has happened to our favorite marvel superheroes in their own respective lives iron man is forced back into action when he was in the middle of a date with pepper potts the starspangled soldier captain america has woken up from his 70yearold frozen sleep and has a lot to explore in his new surroundings the new fresh revamped bruce banner has been helping sick kids in india black widow is taking a day off by taking another mission when a call from agent coulson requires her to return to normal business with nick fury thor comes a bit later on and we meet newcomer master archer hawkeyeso whats the danger this time its none other than loki from thor to answer some of your questions no he didnt die the postcredits scene from thor so even if he didnt die how did he arrive on earth when the bridge connecting the different universes has been destroyed apparently loki was saved by another alien race called the chitauri he offers a deal with the chitauri leader he will command the chitauri army in an attempt to subjugate earth in exchange for the tesseract so loki arrives through the tesseract which has the ability to build portals on earth and starts to execute his planwhile loki was doing fine in the early stages of his schemes the heroes didnt get along so well in the beginning as reality would suggest the members of the team get into some fights theres one actionpacked scene where iron man fights against thor with captain america caught in between theres a lot of dispute between the superheroes much to lokis favor all due to either rivalry jealousy suspiciousness or many other reasons this gives the heroes more humanity and possibly some vulnerability which really make the movie more realistic this is just one of the highlights of joss whedons flawless scriptjoss whedon also successfully blended the different universes of the different superheroes and made it into one film this is rather difficult considering the natures of the superheroes world war ii to captain america seems like yesterday and he still has a lot to catch up with he doesnt know who stephen hawking is thor who is of mythological nature is still used to asgardian lifestyle joss whedon successfully pulled this off and so the interaction between the different superheroes seem sensible not awkward the dialog is perfect and naturalperhaps the best thing about this movie is the action by giving the characters the sense of vulnerability the fight scenes seem more risky and more heartpumping while it may be heartracing the action scenes are also fun to watch especially when we see the incredible hulk in action the hulk is just a mindless monster although he suddenly becomes aware of himself towards the climax who wrecks havoc at anything that he considers a potential threat his role in destroying the enemies during the climax was very entertaining that said the climax and finale of the film was one of the best and one of the most thrilling ive ever seen it offers brilliant visual effects and conjures up enough awe to satisfy anyone seeking intense sequences of action by the end of it youll be satisfied but will still be eager for morethe performances were very convincing robert downey jr played the role of the quirky tony stark to perfection his dialog his performance everything about him was just perfect chris evans also had a strong performance playing the role of captain america he was able to exploit the captains inner feelings chris hemsworth also did justice with thor samuel l jackson did a commanding job as nick fury jeremy renner played a determined hawkeye scarlett johansson played a sexy and deadly black widow tom hiddleston portrayed a malicious and manipulating loki however the main star of the show was mark ruffalo as the incredible hulk he was able to portray a calm tranquil bruce banner but also showed signs that bruce banner can at any time become the hulkthe humor is heartwarming and very well every now and then theres always a little bit of humor to cheer up the audience while one might expect that most of the humor would come from the charismatic robert downey jr actually the humor is divided equally among the characters including loki why i love this is because every character has a chance to shine and steal the scenethe is a mustsee and a great movie to start the summer movie season its got the interesting premise the operatic action scenes the great jokes and many more to offer this is absolutely one of the best if not the best superhero film of all time it offers a great deal of fun for a broad range of viewers just get up from the couch head to the nearest movie theater and watch the its great and 3d is a viable option oh and once the credits roll dont leave yet theres two postcredits scenes you dont want to miss and one of them involves the chitauri leaderrating 910final verdict the is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films of all time and is guaranteed to blow audiences away with plenty of action sequences outstanding visual effects a powerful script and solid performances,fantasy
i have no idea how joss whedon has made this film work not only does this work but this is one of the best superhero films ive ever seen surprisingly the script isnt as biased towards iron man as i thought it would be and every character gets a good amount of screen time and their chance to shine black widow and hawkeye more than hold their own and they arent just in the background whilst the other superheroes dominate the screen and have all the action widow and hawkeye do some unbelievably awesome things and are crucial to the story the dialogue is consistently witty and hilarious every character gets to deliver a good punchline before the film is up the final battle in manhattan lasts a good half an hour at least and i didnt want it to end the action was of an epic scope and was absolutely jaw dropping but the real surprise and best part of this film by far is the hulk after 2 so so films they finally got the hulk right and dare i say it hes my favourite avenger after this and this will probably be the case for most of you when you leave the theatre this film was action packed but it wasnt transformers this film had heart intelligent dialogue and a cast of brilliant actors playing conflicting egos and colourful characters every actor is spot on in their respective roles tom hiddleston makes for an excellent villain playing loki thors brother and robert downey jr is much better here than he was in iron man 2 the only problem i really had with it was that in the middle it dragged on ever so slightly but this was forgotten by the time the credits rolled it has to be said though if you havent seen any of the marvel films before this you wont have any idea whats going on and you probably wont really care for the film until the last hour or so kicks in make sure you stay through the end credits its not over just yet,fantasy
this is my first review ever on imdb and why do i choose a movie that i dont like i find it absolutely disgusting that this movie has a 86 rating i can believe how people actually like this stuff maybe they slept all the way through it i cant say this movie brings absolutely nothing new or interesting to the big screen its totally predictable and not funny it contains so many lame jokes that it makes you feel a bit nauseated at some points the action is stupid and seen before in older and better movies the plot is wait a second what plot the only positive thing in this movie is robert downey jr but he alone cannot make up for all the flaws that exist in this movie certain points in the movie feel very long and i assume this is because of the actors lack of talent they are dull and have no feelings and i laughed every time captain america was show on the screen his mask looks absolutely hilarious and i laughed even harder when some of the evil space dudes pulled of his mask because id bet that even the film crew found him looking ridiculous in that outfiti guess the is a good movie if you find trouble sleeping one night just put it on and youll be sleeping in no time,fantasy
without a doubt the is the most expensive video game ever produced why the techs would want to try to integrate liveaction elements however is beyond me the cartoon was okay without them robert downey has the best lines half a dozen oneliners to be precise though thors contention that loki was adopted was just as funny sam jackson looks just plain bored throughout which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that hes the most overrated actor in hollywood you know a movies heavily padded when fully onethird of it could be cut and never missed the first third of this game is mindnumbingly clichd and plays out like yet another pseudomilitary video game what used to be called firstperson shooter games but are nowadays referred to as firstperson action games or television show the likes of which weve seen a thousand times the skrull at the end was a nice little touch but i wonder why comics and now their celluloid incarnations tend to focus on alien invasions for their big gettogethers when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on earth i think john carpenter they live and george romero land of the dead had it right we have seen the enemy and he is us give me rodney cecil psycho hero any day,fantasy
this film isto put it simply is epic assemble is the perfect example of why peoplesuch as myselflove marvel comicsit tells the story of earths mightiest heroes finally assembling to protect the planetiron mancaptain americathorhulkhawkeye and black widow are put together to fight loki and his evil hordeit isnt all fighting though it also has a comedy element provided by the acting talents of robert downey jri am already looking forward to the sequelthis can already be called the best film of 2012thank you to everyone who helped make this film amazing,fantasy
i was not prepared to sit and watch past the first five minutes with all the jerky shakycam going on gave me a headache trying to watch itit seems all you need these days to make a movie just shake the camera for a couple of hours not,fantasy
 but is the ultimate fan of joss whedon i came to this film with virtually no background in the marvelverse so i was a bit confused at first my husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when i had questions but i have to admit the script did a good job of filling in the blanks minus a few details this is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development courtesy of joss whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence he has to know that at some level that he once again did the impossible he took what could have easily been a disaster and he produced gold he created a movie that was fun and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the marvel movie universe and gave each character their time to shine it has great acting quippy dialogue tons of very well done action and a decent if underplayed level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters they worked individually they worked collectively it had lots of ultimate alliance moments hulk shoves a piece of armor into the giant worm and thor hammers it into his head thor brings his hammer down on caps shield and causes a huge shockwave thor shoots lightning at iron man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400 giving him a supercharged shot i love that all of those moments were added i also love how joss had a bunch of the heroes fight each other in a way that made sense in the context of the movie thor vs hulk thor vs cap thor vs iron man hawkeye vs black widow black widow vs hulk you cant help but love each and every fight will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about citizen kane probably not but whedon accomplished in the 2010s in making a film in which i was completely engrossed for two and a half hours had a wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled and isnt that why we go to the movies in the first place,fantasy
 from all the tea breaks i had to take this movie failed to hold my attention at all ok maybe for a few 30 second intervals yes the cgi is good but so are a lot of other movies the sound is good but so are a lot of other movies none of the actors seemed to have to make much effort probably because the script and plot were pretty much irrelevant,fantasy
this movie is totally overrated the movie was just so hyped due to the fact that it contained everyones favourite super herothere was no plot no character development and not particularly special effects that made it memorablethe overall story seemed kind of lame and ridiculous why was the main antagonist loki and how did it made sense that it took so many super heroes to defeat someone who was technically one of their own the comedic portions contained a few smiles but it wasnt laughing materialin short the movie hadnt met my expectations,fantasy
seriously unless you are the stereotypical fanboytestosteronedrunkenviewer type this will be 85 a waste of your time the other 15 a few funny lines throughout the talk between thor  loki right before ironman interferes the ensuing battle between shellhead and the thunder god and hulk wiping the floor with loki so if you are too stoneddrunktranquilizedbymarlinperkins this campy cinema wont kill you unless you sober up quick and live near a high precipice and really it could be worse like if theyd used britney spears or lindsay lohan drunkdrugged to play the black widow or maybe if theyd gotten george costanza to get into it with doc banner over eating the last muffin top,fantasy
the good robert downey jr is charming as ever scarlett johannsen is delicious as ever chris evans makes a great captain america mark ruffalo turned in a good performance as david banner samuel jackson is usual badass self did i leave anyone out the cgi is up to todays usual high standard oh i nearly forgot the thor guy was pretty cool too though why does a scandinavian god speak with a british accentthe bad theres no plot loki is a 1dimensional villain he wants to be king he wants people to submit thats it thats all there isi expected more from joss whedon like the incredible reboot j j abrams was able to deliver star trek damn it i dont really care much for star trek but abrams had me nearly crying at the start of that movieinstead with we get another paintbynumbers superhero movie you can make a superhero movie with heart look at the original superman or more recently dark knight and even kick ass i want action and plenty of it but i also want to connect with the characters on screenthe problem with is that connection isnt there and theres not a lot happening either the production values are high but thats no substitute for a plot until the cgi battle at the end i was a kind of bored,fantasy
i walked in the cinema when there was about 12 hour left of the movie i thought i had entered the wrong hall in the complex and had walked into the transformers 3 performancesame snake type cgi same scenes of cars flying around same type of buildings being wrecked and in the same mannerthe only apparent difference was the main characters which made me realise i was not watching transformers 3 but something strangely similar i had seen enough and did not stay in the hall to watch the film from the starti cant understand why this film got a 86 note perhaps everyone who participated logged in and gave it 10 i gave it 2 instead of 1 only because jenny agutter is in it,fantasy
first of all i am a fan of superhero movies but marvel with iron man 2 and now this monstrosity is losing mei had mixed expectations before seeing this movie and i went out of it depressed about the state of the moviemaking industry and more specifically the fate of superhero storiesif that is the kind of scenario which deserves to be acclaimed from every corner why should directors like christopher nolan keep working on adding depth and substance to their movies if immature and empty scenarios such as the can earn as much praise i am clueless ok there needs to be movies for teenagers and i am fine with that but that does not mean it should be praised as much as the godfatherthe really can be summarized as two hours of four superheroes fighting each other over the location of some blue cube because loki wanted it so just like drunken guys in any tavern and who finally come together to fight again in a huge alien battle on manhattan against aliens who cant shoot straight have fragile weaponry and who are led by a demigod loki who ends up being simply beaten up by hulk with his barehands no questions asked just as if batman would destroy superman because it makes for a funny endingif anyone can add anything of substance to what i have just described only with sarcasm i admit i am willing to hear about itthis was a poor movie and how well it was received by critics shows how big corporations like disney now control the industry with propaganda in order to create mass hysteria independent thought is dead,fantasy
this is a well made summer blockbusterthe characters are interesting the acting is great and the script is able to be fun but also deep and well written it has everything you may ask for an action movie and even morejoss whedon does an amazing work with the script the acting specially from robert downey jr mark ruffalo and tom hiddleston is top notch the film builds tension during the first two act to culminate in an amazing climax were the visuals are incredibleits basically a role model like star trek in 2009 it can probably inspire a new wave of blockbusters which can be smart without being pretentious powerful without being darkits an amazing film and i would recommend anyone to watch it,fantasy
what can i say i grew up with these guys in the 70s  being an english boy it was not so common to be reading these comics at 10 rather than whizzer and chips et al but i always loved marvel for being more real yeh i know  these are superheroes were talking about i did stop collecting them by the time i was an adult  but yeh  i still got them allit was a childhood dream to imagine seeing these characters in a film but film attempts were always so lame until cgi took holdthe xmen 1  2  1st class spiderman 12 and yes 3 iron man  thor films finally met my childhood expectations the has been the icing on the cake the only disappointment for me is where are janet hank wanda pietro  the visionwill patience comics aside its a great bundle of cinematic fun,fantasy
the marvels movie the is an action packed comedy scifi movie all in one it has everything and everyone in it all of the marvel characters in one brought together by nick fury because loki stole the tesseract that was found in the captain america movie it has thor hulk iron man hawkeye black widow and captain america all the characters are extremely different which made it very difficult for them to come together as one team against their other worldly foe loki it takes the super heroes to get past their own egos and accept each others help its difficult for the characters to come together because theyre personalities are all so different and theyre also used to being the stars by themselves so that makes ten times more difficult to come together there is a lot of inner conflict with the characters too to start off with the inevitable iron man he is still the same iron man a genius with a lot of money and a huge ego captain america just has came back from being frozen since the world war ii times he isnt used to all the technology that is used to really enhance the movie that causes a conflict because iron man refers to captain america as an old man then theres thor who is lokis brother theres more conflict he comes to help because he is against his brothers antics loki believes that a world shouldnt have freedom like ours does he comes to be the ruler and demands it then theres natasha or the black widow to me the typical woman in a super hero movie shes almost seductive they have her in tight clothing and shes manipulative i am surprised that she can hold her own i figured they would have made her more of a damsel in distress because she is the only woman in the movie really her friend hawkeye becomes under lokis spell trying to defend loki from getting the tesseract he ends up having to fight natasha and then comes out of the spell the help in the end then theres hulk who has been trying to hide and stay away pretty much from people so he can keep calm he hates becoming the hulk but when he does he doesnt care who or what is in his way he fights the other characters and tries to hurt them without really being awaredisregarding all of the conflict the characters all come together in the end to take on loki in the typical attack area i feel for a superhero movie new york city it has to happen in a big city to show the impact that it had on the movie all around the quality of the movie is amazing the way all the movies were tied together really worked it was all around a great movie,fantasy
i loved the it is easily my favorite movie of the year so far its the kind of movie that left us happy afterwards that made us want to discuss it at length and made us leave reality in every sense an aesthetic experience i loved the action scenes special effects and all but i suppose what i loved best about it were the hilarious oneliners that literally had the entire cinema laughing out loud there were so many of these too many to count with my fingers in fact there was also one moment when i actually cried but then that was just me i tend to cry over everything sheepish smilei was initially afraid that so many characters in one movie would result in one convoluted mess but the writers managed to make a script that somehow gave each character their own screen time without making it appear too contrived or as though they just forcibly slotted a story in just so a certain character could appear the entire story actually made sense and flowed naturally into one cohesive wholei was also initially afraid that so many hunky heroes in one movie would make my heart or brain explode from confusion as to which one to ship as i had fallen in love with each one of these heroes when i watched their individual films in the years past okay not all of them just iron man thor and captain america but heres what i realized  the makes for an interesting study in finding out what a girl truly finds attractive in a man depending on who she loves most among the heroes is it captain america the handsome and wholesome boy next door with the heros noble heart is it thor the fierce masculine man with rippling muscles facial hair and deep throaty growl is it the hulk the reserved brainiac with a surprisingly endearing shy smile or it it iron man the witty genius billionaire playboy philanthropist in his own wordsi am not going to recap the story just go watch it yourself it will be worth every single penny i tells ya,fantasy
the is truly a film that should be considered an instant classic joss whedon does more than do justice to getting four superheroes on the screen but he makes a tremendous yarn to go with it yes the greatest strength of the film is the screenplay the one liners are a keeper and it comes with some great performances as well particularly with robert downey jr and mark ruffalo the film entertains in action succeeds in comedy and manages to be one of the greatest films were bound to see this summer and potentially one of the best films well see of the year and an end note if you do a sequel please keep joss whedon without him expect the 2 to be less entertaining overall,fantasy
if you honestly love one of those heroes hulk captain america iron man or thor this movie is will be a pleasure for you however if you want to see the because of thrilling special effects or tense action you will be disappointed first 23 of the movie is constant talking and staring at each other followed with clich superherotype lines and couple of fights between each other if not r downeys iron man and his sense of humor it would be a pure pain i dont know if it was because of too salty popcorns or because of lack of action on the screen but after an hour of watching it i became really really bored id bet on the latter however the last 15 of the is the battle in nyc fight scenes humour and cg looks pretty good however there is slight feeling that everything was just too easy in any way you shouldnt search for logic in these type of movies  there isnt anybottom line good for fans average for everyone else but 87  you have to be kidding,fantasy
seriously guys its a great action movie but this should not be in the top 250 listthe action was greatthe storyline though was not consistent with the comic books was decentthe special effects were great as expectedthe characters were believableon and on it was an acceptably average movie worth spending moneywatching it in theatres in 3d was a real treat but no way in hell was it memorable or noteworthy or groundbreaking it certainly does not deserve to be in top 250 list and be rated above 8 because its just an average moviei am beginning to loose faith in imdb rating system now,fantasy
my friend took me to see the most hyped movie of the year and i have to say as a fan of superhero movies this is the best one by farthe film is about nick fury played by samuel l jackson who wants to assemble an army of consisting of iron man played by robert downy jr the hulk played by mark ruffalo black widow played by scarlett johansson captain america played by chris evans thor played by chris hemsworth and hawkeye played by jeremy renner who have to take out loki thors brother played by tom hiddleston from destroying the world with a device known as the tesseractthis was such a great movie the action was fantastic has great special effects really funny moments like the guy playing galaga on the jobif you have seen the movie then you know what im talking about a fantastic third act which some of the movie was shot in my hometown of cleveland ohio there is a cameo by stan lee at the end of the movie and the only superhero movie i know that has a reference to marijuana in it the only complaint was that it felt like a 3 12 hour movie but since the movie was that good i can let it slip if you do not see this in theaters than you have no personalityrated pg13 for intense sequences of scifi violence and action throughout and a mild drug reference2hrs 22min142min,fantasy
the is a great exercise in the art of fantasy moviemaking its exemplary and superior production value great performance by a stellar cast all portraying iconic superheroes clever and witty dialogues albeit with some nonchalant sarcasm thrown by rdj as the charismatic and philanthropic billionaire with an obsession for high end technology and sophisticated gadgets superb pacing nary a monotonous moment adequate and sufficient background information for the uninitiated those who havent seen thor captain america the incredible hulk  the iron man franchise but not overly cumbersome in its flashback of the introductory sequences magnificent cinematography and mesmerizing vfx profusely suitable background score without unnecessary cacophony and a brilliant tightknit plot giving each and every character enough time and screen presence to develop their respective characters makes this as the best movie of 2012 by far without any hyperbole and on par with batmandark knight as possibly the greatest superhero movie comprising of a heavy hitting ensemble cast delivering undoubtedly marvels finest effort till date director joss whedon has done an exceptional and brilliant job a must watch movie which is surely going to be an epic its an amazing movie full of heart gravitas emotion and depth the onscreen chemistry between all the lead characters is uncanny and unparalleled 1010 a must watch for every hollywood movie buff  superhero aficionado,fantasy
i watched before some hours and i tell only one word about the movie it was awesome i dont think so that this movie is better than thisgo to the theaters and experience the most entertaining movie of 2012 with superb actionsthe characters were written perfectly the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch the story had the perfect balance of comedy action and drama yes theres a bit of that too and its good its everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movieevery member of the lineup whether super powered or not got the right amount of screen time if you were like me and thought that iron man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like iron man and friends your fears will be washed awayjosh whedon pulled off the impossible he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation he created what i consider the best superhero movie so far he made theto say anything more would be a waste of time just go and watch it,fantasy
this is one of the most overrated movies i have seen im not much of a superhero fan but i did enjoy spiderman 1 2 and 3 as well as ironman ive never seen thor or captain america so i know im missing a little backstory but i doubt it would add a lot to the experience in this movie the story was subpar and very predictable there is also no sense of danger whatsoever since these superheroes are near invincible which is why i tend to avoid superhero movies action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99100 times i laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats yes the visuals are decent but thats not what makes a movie when comparing this film to guardians of the galaxy its no contest gotg had drama humor that wasnt forced a decent story and fantastic visuals if you are a marvel fan you will probably like this film simply because you love the characters i was looking for something other than mindless action and unfortunately i did not get that,fantasy
this film tells the story of a team of superheroes who save the world from an evil and ambitious extraterrestrial manbeing a blockbuster the does have all the elements to entertain the crowd the idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket the stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing the visual effects are great especially the finale which lasts for an hour the massive destruction of manhattan is literally earth shattering i was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline and all the action that goes on i enjoyed the film a lot,fantasy
writing a review for a hugely anticipated film just about to release worldwide is a very difficult thing but its equally if not more difficult to hold back your emotions when youve been extremely lucky to watch the most electrifying ensemble in the history of cinema thus fardont worry im not going to spoil anything you wish to discover on our own accord but when we talk about being disappointed because of the high expectations we had from a movie i can assure you that no matter how high your hopes may be pinned on this film you will not get be disappointed at any costjoss whedon has put together some of the most talented actors out there into a very sensibly written scriptfunny thrilling lacking even a single dull moment to create what i would like to refer to as a phenomenal film which till now was considered only a rare possibilityi will say one thing though while the film was still in development i was bit weary of tom middleton handling all these superheroes by himself but to my amazement he was a total badintense and menacing a supervillan to simplify what im trying to say hats off to you mate just one word to sum it all up  marvellous,fantasy
i along with thousands of others grew up a huge superhero fan film makers capitalized on the superhero fandom by making franchises off of the most popular heroes such as superman batman and spiderman i remember as a kid loving those movies but i would think man how cool would it be if they made a justice league or an movie but it was just a dream until 2012 after iron man started the mcu in 2008 superhero fans and movie fans everywhere witnessed a legendary event when the graced the big screen and boy was it goodiron man the incredible hulk thor and captain america the first avenger introduced us to all the main characters in this movie so there was no need for dumb intros coughcough suicide squad whats great is that each of our heroes are at different places in their journeys and it shows in their roles in this film the casts does an amazing job of playing a group of very different heroes coming together not because they fit well together but because they have to in order to save the world the plot may be simple but it works the film is fun actionpacked and evenly paced loki is my favorite mcu villain to date i know i know  thanos  hes great and all but theres something about tom hiddlestons loki that is so likable without downplaying him as a threatinfinity war may be remembered as the greatest movie but this movie will always be my favorite,fantasy
to keep this short i love this movie all of the characters are amazing and the actors playing these characters are also doing an amazing job of really capturing the way these characters should be portrayed i think that robert downey jr as iron man was a great casting choice as he is able to show the loving and caring side of tony stark and also the cocky arrogant and snarky side of him chris hemsworth as thor was also amazing some of the lines that he had with the other were amazing and hemsworth is good at making it seem as though thor has no idea why humans do what they do chris evans as steve rodgers was somewhat a save for the actors marvel career as the last time he appeared in a marvel movie he played the human torch in the very disappointing fantastic four movies he also does very good at acting as though hes from the 1940s all of the other performances were outstanding but the one that stands out is tom hiddleston as loki he was a compelling villain intimidating and funny at times overall i think the movie is all around amazing and is definitely my favourite mcu movie so far,fantasy
the aka the first ever official superhero crossover on the big screen aka the most successful superhero film ever made aka the movie that did not impress me when it first came out and neither does it now and before anyone who will read this review think that im your regular joe that doesnt like this movie because i dont like comic book movies or that i simply have no familiarity with the world of the thus i feel lost when im watching the film here is some little info for ya ive been reading the comics or comics with the way way before ive heard about this movie kurt busieks comics being my favorites in fact i think that most of those who think that this movie is the pinnacle of filmmaking are the people who never even heard of the before this movie so unawareness of the world of the was definitely not the factor hereso what is my problem heres the thing unlike people like john campea jeremy jahns or bob chipman im not a manchild sometimes i may be but for the most time im not so i usually usually but not always tend to not be overly hyperbolic about any kind of insignificant things such as movies so when i see a movie like the im not reaching for a deeper thought in it deeper meaning deeper impact and cleverness if i dont see any and and i dont see any of that i dont see the impact in the movie itself nor i can comprehend the level of impact it cause around the globe and how it shaped the hollywood landscape in general this movie gained the same reputation as the dark knight in some regards for its supposed reinvention of its respective genre and in others for being considered overrated by a lot of people for its overexposure within the pop culture but the difference is i can see why the dark knight would be so highly regarded since it have completely reinvented the comic book movie genre the action genre and turned the idea of a summer blockbuster completely on its head the however doesnt have that the only real invention this movie has is the sole fact it exists there is nothing particularly intriguing about the story because there is barely any since this is all there is to a plot act one  setup act two  exposition dump with characters doing nothing act three  action action explosions hulk smash or characters with captain america and hawkeye being the third wheels of the movie or even cinematography this is just a movie a fun movie but a movie nothing more nothing lessbut to get the original point here is my problem with the movie first of all i dont like the look of the film it has been brought up by some people so its definitely an issue  the cinematography its ugly for a movie of such magnitude that had no budgetary restrictions i really baffles me how it turned out to look like a cheap pilot for a tv episode maybe it is because the director got his start on television maybe its because they were just too lazy to film it on film as oppose to digital  doesnt matter the fact is the cinematography is poorsecond of all the story flow and the story itself is pretty standard and boring the setup of each character at the beginning leaves a lot be desired when they finally get together there is some fun with their interaction but most of it feels very scripted and unnatural third of all my main gripe there some characters that are just there because of some obligation not because someone thought that there is an interesting story to tell with them and i of course am referring to hawkeye and captain america they barely have anything to do in this movie in terms of development and they get their due only at the very end they were in this movie only because you cant make an movie without them since they both are original members of the in the comicsfourth of all the last act couldve been done way better im not complaining so much about the overabundance of the action as much as i do about the lack of variety in its set pieces you wont surprise anyone by showing an hourlong scene where new york gets destroyed by an army of aliens we saw that in transformers three timesall in all i would put this movie on the same level as movies like independence day than star wars and back to the future it doesnt have that same charm and rewatchability as aforementioned movies do,fantasy
an example of inspiring cinema directed for young and old alike the is does it all in this recent block buster i agree with rabbi scott of houstons congregation emanu el when he described the pleasure he derived from the mesmerized youngsters in the audience as much as his own enjoyment of this super hero film robert downey jr is iron man once again and he gives another uniformly perfect performance chris evans is captain america and he too is outstanding as this supermanlike individual fighting for truth and justice and the american way mark ruffalo plays dr bruce banner the hulk and he too is well cast and successful with his part thor is portrayed by chris hemsworth and he too is exemplary with his performance of course there is samuel l jackson as nick fury the leader of this brave crew scarlett johansson as black widownatasha romanoff is very convincing and an extremely tough ingnue in a film which is not directed by woody allen joss whedon has written and directed this smash hit in 3d and i advise that it be seen with this medium since the special effects are enhanced to the point of overwhelming reality dont miss this remarkable marvel comic piece it is worth the effort for you and all the youngsters in the audience who will be glued to the screen,fantasy
an article i read summed up the as the antidark knight which is not a bad thing its just about as quality but rather than being dark and gritty this movie is fun with hilarious yet intelligent dialogue this is the truest comic book film no were not given a bad pun about the villains costume in the middle of really intense scenes the movie is intense intelligent hilarious and fun which is a very odd combo for a movie one would expect to be very hollywoodthis movie spits in the faces of more serious moviewatchers even they will get absorbed into this movie for many reasons usually in a hollywood movie with the success this one was expected to accumulate youd see more sex and idiots on screen twisting the plot in the most ridiculous of ways well scarlett johansson is not used for seduction on other characters or sexual appeal to viewers she is here to play black widow and be a crucial part of the film as for idiots there are none the characters in this movie are all smart and necessary to the story all of them do a great job even mark ruffalo whose presence will make you forget the great norton was even the hulk firstthe story is just about as wellbalanced as one could hope for between intelligence action tension and flow the characters backgrounds are all tied together very well and the story isnt centered around one character too much more than another the main characters all get equal screen time and importance to the movies monumentally huge and intelligent plot for those who complain were not given enough depth on characters we were given a good amount of depth if we wouldve gone any more in depth on any one of the characters the flow of the movie wouldve succeeded less we see enough from everyoneto cap this movie off the action was superb its always exciting anytime there is fighting sequences which are plentiful the special effects are really welldone which is expected from a movie with such a budget as this one had to work with the money was all put to good use great action great actors great directing great plot great dialogue great moviethe only complaints one could have is they didnt stick with the comic books or these guys werent the original this is a film you cannot directly copy a comic exactly when making a comic book movie its a movie it stands alone other complaints are just a few bad lines that are easily pardoned with how much the rest of the script outweighs the few bad linesthis movie spits in the faces of serious moviewatchers it surely did in mine i didnt think id come across a movie with such an ominous plot in which the manner of the characters isnt totally serious this is the one great film that was able to do that and still maintain a level of greatness that it does this is one of the greatest 2000s films i rank it right up there with the dark knight return of the king city of god inception etc one of the greats of our time,fantasy
over the past five years we have been exposed to the marvel cinematic universe which has introduced us to a multitude of characters finally it all comes to a head in this massive ensemble following the arrival of the norse god loki tom hiddleston shield director nick fury samuel l jackson assembles a team of six of the most powerful individuals the world has ever seen to combat the threat however their egos and suspicions of one another create a lot of friction in the group many feared that the screen time of this film would be dominated by a single character with the rest simply playing supporting roles they neednt have worried as each avenger is given an appropriate amount of attention returning to their roles from the previous marvel films are robert downey jr as the pretentious yet wellmeaning industrialist tony starkiron man chris evans as the recently resurrected world war ii hero steve rogerscaptain america chris hemsworth as norse god thor lokis stepbrother and scarlett johansson as enigmatic spy natasha romanoffblack widow jeremy renner expands upon his brief cameo in thor as clint bartonhawkeye by far the most interesting member of the group replacing edward norton as bruce bannerthe hulk is mark ruffalo who fills the role surprisingly well badass as usual is jackson as fury we also see quite a lot of fan favorite agent phil coulson clark gregg who makes his most memorable appearance so far returning in supporting roles are virginia pepper potts gwyneth paltrow and dr eric selvig stellan skarsgard introduced in this film is agent maria hill cobie smulders who doesnt really get enough screen time to make a proper impression while the entire cast is solid the best performance by far is by hiddleston as the films primary villain he cuts an imposing figure peering a death glare at the audience and relishing every word as he attempts to get inside the heroes heads director joss whedon the man behind buffy the vampire slayer and firefly once again shows his ability to create a wellmade ensemble piece following in the footsteps of jon favreau kenneth branagh louis letterier and joe johnston he was the ideal choice for this film whedon was able to cover all of the necessary areas from the emotional impact of the death of a major character to the films many moments of humor and the many heartracing action scenes another triumph is the films special effects the motion capture used to create the hulk has made him look more realistic than any previous liveaction portrayal lokis army of chitauri aliens are a convincing force to be reckoned with and vehicles are created that could never exist in reality furthermore whedon alumni alexis denisof is unrecognizable as the other a mysterious villain who hints at what is going on behind the scenes and what will come to the front in future installments while it wont win any oscars the succeeds in all of the intended areas a characterdriven story with heart action and humor it brings these iconic characters to the big screen in a way that does them justice and will thrill audiences from beginning to end,fantasy
i had the extreme pleasure of seeing this movie last weekend at a facebook fan screening in hollywood i waited in line for 2 hrs to see this movie and was greeted by the surprise appearance of writerdirector josh whedon stars chris thor hemsworh tom loki hiddleston clark agent phil coulson cobie maria hill smulders and producer kevin feige and let me just say  i would gladly stand in line for another 2 hrs to see it againthe in one word was amazing josh whedon and his cast and crew knocked this movie right out of the ball park and into a whole new cinematic universe  the action humor and story were spot on the action and characters were ripped right out of the pages and put right onto the screen everything you love about the comics is there and then some it was immediately obvious that this movie was made by the fans for the fans it dozent matter if your a fan of comics or cartoons everyone will find something to like about this movie just be prepared for a rollercoaster ride and a a great time at the moviesi have to say when i first heard mr whedon was attached to direct as a buffy and angel fan i was excited but he succeeded all my expectations and then some anyone says you just cant write a good script with this many actors and give them all their own story arc should attend the josh whedon school of screenwriting mr whedon did a phenomenal job of handling each character providing every actor big and small their time to shinethe have assembled and i cant wait to see them again an again ,fantasy
i dont usually write reviews and i am not an expert on analyzing all that cinematographic stuff or how god of a job director did all i can say is that i had a time of my life it was an amazing film with an amazing storyline and amazing actors in it when i first heard about the i was very happy yet skeptical about it my biggest concern was how they were going to put all these legendary characters into one film and provide them all with enough screen time to achieve some character development even after seeing it i have no idea how they did it but they not only did it they smashed it right from the start i was taken to a ride of my life i could not take my eyes out of what was going on in terms of special effect it was topnotch as it was expected no question about it people are praising this film for being very witty and having a lot of comedy in it i have to say i am not a fan of comedy but this film made me laugh more than any other comedy in a very long time having to see hulk smashing loki or capitan america patronizing ironman or ironman fighting thor was something you could have dreamt of to see on the big screen when you were a kid but having a chance to see it done and developed in such an effective and spectacular fashion was beyond my wildest expectations and trust me i had very high hopes for this film well sorry for not being very structured and coherent about the whole thing i just wanted to share a little bit of joy and excitement that i have been provided with watching this amazing film its an epic masterpiece and seeing it on the big screen is a one of those things you have to do before you die thats for sure,fantasy
speaking as a fan of iron man and the rash of other constituent superhero films in the last few years and a fan of the and as a fan of joss whedon i can say that i was really pumped to see this film add to that the early reviews calling this film the greatest superhero film of all time and i was ready to go having seen it with a very participatory audience on friday night i was blown away joss whedon delivered on all the promises that had been made but the best superhero film of all time really well i still think watchmen deserve that particular honor realizing that i might have offended well everybody with that comment it must be said that there a couple of qualifiers herei think as a film discrete from any other films or comics thus cutting out the graphic novel in watchmens case as well as the mountain of literature involving the and its many characters watchmen takes it its structure and tone are more adult oriented which lowered the box office figures and since the best cut of that movie is the directors cut that hurt it too but i believe it is a better film having said that and having gotten it out of the way i now proceed to what the brings to the table that makes this film more fun than watchmen we add back in all the connections to movies and comics and pow you have a mythos that everyone is aware of and has been awaiting for four years or more and the wins hands down just for its cultural impact everyone may not know who doctor manhattan is but if you are reading this or are breathing you probably have heard of the incredible hulk or iron manone of the things i like about the marvel universe is that the heroes in its world fight each other this is one of the reasons i was attracted to watchmenthe themselves are directed to glory by joss whedon who had the overwhelming task of first making these guys fight each other and then come together as a team this problem alone would have made most directors run away and hide under the bed but he does it he is helped by the fact that he did not have to tell one single origin story this had all been taken care of in the earlier movies this also creates the disadvantage that the characters have to now meet each other and not bore the audience with redundancies not only that he does it without making the characters look silly or rather more accurately makes it so the silliness of a hammer throwing norse god coming to blows with a soldier from world war ii dressed in an american flag is not an obstacle but becomes the path to common ground the job of getting these guys to work together in the film falls to nick fury played by an irreverent samuel l jackson one aspect of furys character is that being a spysoldier this guy can look into his superiors faces and say i understand you made a decision but since it was a stupid ass decision i decided to ignore it it is not hard to figure out why nick fury would be the one to be the one to conceive of the initiative in the first place the group he gathers to save the earth consists of an egomaniac a megalomaniac norse god an old time american soldier with testosterone in abundance a very hot girl who can get information out of anyone and it must be said should get her butt its own show and last and certainly not least a guy who has breathtaking anger management issues the actors also step up to the job as well and since my memory for actors names is rather sketchy youll forgive me for taking the quick route robert downey jr is the same iron man hes always been the hulk well ill save him for last thor manages to deliver one of the funniest lines in the film while simultaneously causing my wife to form a puddle of drool in her lap the guy is freaking good lookin what can i say which is okay because i was lovin scarlett whatsherfaces butt captain america makes up for the deficiencies of his origin movie by playing his role with a mixture of frustration at his circumstances and the loyalty of a soldier there is also a star turn from clark gregg who acts in a redshirt capacity then there is samuel l jackson who just has to stand there and look coolnow for the hulk i got excited originally because i am a fan of edward norton i watched that movie because i was a fan of edward norton and when time came i expected edward norton to be there to round out a perfect cast instead i was informed that someone named mark ruffalo was taking his place now while he did extremely well i was waiting to see edward norton and robert downy jr play off each other i think if there is one severe disappointment in the acting it is this onei began writing this review because fans in the ebullience of the opening weekend called this the best superhero film ever i disagreed heres how it breaks down pure movie making strictly movie to movie goes to watchmen storytelling goes to watchmen beauty goes to watchmen mass appeal goes to the pure fun goes to the intellectual satisfaction goes to watchmen action goes to the character is a tie pure satisfaction upon finishing the movie goes to thei think the wins,fantasy
the movie is just full of awesomeness d tony stark mind blowingnd hulk is also awesomeall the characters were perfectall are my favoritethe best scene was hulk vs loki d just awesomend m sure the 2 will also b coming d must watch guys must watchawesome movie or the best movie of the year d m m sure this review was enough to make u watch the movieyou can watch it thrice or more coz m gonna watch it thrice,fantasy
as one of the seemingly few whos not a fan of the iron man character or his films and after seeing the trailers for this film i had my reservations about the was it going to be iron man 3 guest starring the rest well yes and no its clear who joss whedons favourites are as they get the most character development those who come out on top  tony stark of course black widow and  surprisingly  bruce bannerthe hulk if youre a fan of these charactersthe actors who portray them then you should be satisfied with the amount of screen time they get captain america gets his moments of leadership hawkeye  nick fury do alright for themselves even agent coulson gets a fair amount of screen timedevelopment sadly thor gets the short end of the stickor hammer id thoroughly enjoyed thor in his solo movie and chris hemsworth in the role so i was hoping hed get the respect and focus he deserved as part of this ensemble cast it seems tony starks oneliners and the hulk beating the crap out of characters for laughs were more important howeverfans of tony stark who dont mind his attitude and want nothing more than him spouting snark aplenty and blowing crap up should be happy annoyingly even his love interest gets to be the sole love interest to appear in this film too bad for jane foster or peggy carter  both of whom i prefer as characters though at least we get to see a picture of them each and thankfully its mentioned that janes safe i wish thor had been allowed to reunite with her before he left again rdj does his thing and hes naturally fine doing it but im probably in the minority who prefers him as sherlock in the sherlock holmes filmsscarlett johansson gets to kick sufficient arse as natasha romanoffblack widow she also does a good job of subverting the obvious  something whedon is a fan of that and scenes where everyone yells over the top of each other theres a few moments you think shes showing signs of weakness but then its turned on its head and you see shes smart and more than capablenot to be underestimated theres not really any beauty taming the beast thing that the trailers may have led some to believe in regards to her character and the hulk quite the opposite speaking of the other guy as bruce calls him this hulk looks better than the two previous movie versions thanks to motioncapture allowing mark ruffalo to actually portray the notsojolly green giant hulks face even bears some resemblance to ruffalo bruce gets to be all brooding and restrained for the bulk of the movie but when he eventually hulks out he does plenty smashocrash the hulk is also played for some rather annoying laughs at times like when he punches thor after theyve just teamed up to take down a baddie why because its funny or he cuts loki off midspeechifying by pounding him into the floor repeatedly thus kinda undoing all the time  effort tom hiddleston had been spending making loki menacing theres a few moments where loki really shows why he was the best villain to use in this film despite the hulk taking care of him pretty easilycap thankfully gets to retain his likability and calls tony out on his bs these two come to blows verbally on more than one occasion while thor resorts to fisticuffs with iron man and the hulkand yet he never seems to be allowed to have a true victory this is the real disappointment of the movie  a character who had undergone a true heros journey in his film and deserved to be taken seriously is disrespectedtreated as a joke more often than not sure he  mjlnir get to kick a fair amount of butt but not nearly enough as they should have he doesnt even get to be the one who takes down loki in the end or saves everyone that would be the hulk and iron man tony winds up being the one to save the city he and pepper in the stark building are the last ones we see before the movie ends not counting the midcredits scene that is and no theres no scene after the credits at least not in the version i saw such a shame that thor gets screwed overthough he does get at least one good line itll be interesting to see the next thor film pick up where we leave thor  loki at the end of this filmhawkeye fans might be a tad miffed that he spends most of the film as a bad guy but he does eventually return to the side of good and has a backstory between him and natasha explored nick fury gets to be all sneakymanipulative and jumps on the lets blame thor train he also shoots some stuff as does his offsider agent hill cobie smulderswhen shes not providing exposition or miraculously escaping death the one actual good guy casualty of the film you can probably guesshaving said all this and my few qualms aside the film is actually exceptionally wellmade whedon proves he can do action with the best of them and his direction is blissfully free of overuse of shakycam its quite the feat bringing all these characters from different filmsuniverses together and actually making it work but he does it splendidly not a dollar of the movies considerable budget has been wasted its all up there on screen some of the humour works all the actors do well in their roles but i personally am looking more forward to further individual adventures with thor and cap in their own movies than i am the inevitable sequel to this movie though i wouldnt say no to seeing the reassemble,fantasy
after seeing the trailer of the movie and the names and numbers of stars in the movie with a great status as no 1 top movies and sales of 207 m  for just the first week with ranking 88 i took my family to the theater to watch it  the story is nice but the way it was produced make almost as reading a book with a lot of chatting between main characters  many other movies like the dark night or iron man 1st movie where great cause of the sum of action but in this movie i think the producer should think a again to use all those stars wisely  the action part is not shown as any one well expect from a move full of stars of great power and ability,fantasy
very short counter review from a longtime moviefreak not so much a superherofreak although i read a lot of comic booksthe is completely overestimated in my mind why it mostly reminded me transformers 2 and transformers 3  which were both godawful movies very similar pointless action and destruction without any weight if compared to nolans batman films this is very cheap storytelling without gravityalso i almost slept watching the there is no threat what so ever the villains are plastic robots very boring no tangible psychology behind ittheres no story the flying ship is hugely boring most of the so called heroes are sissies in thighs thor loki arrowdude captain boring etc with exception of the ironfellow who wears steelanything good not really i give one star from maleperspective  scarpetta johansson as its nice to call her is surprisingly watchable when trapped in her chair cheap trick but works also other male star  hulk is interesting those few seconds he got reasonable sequencesall in all two stars theres only few seconds of interesting stuff to watch during this overlong 25h film i try but fail to understand all the hype hopefully you can accept my reasoning,fantasy
just like with transformers movies i started to get very bored half way through it its as if the special effects are so overwhelming that the plot is lost now that i think about it what was the plot ah yes a bad guy with a bad script leading an alien invasion through a gatewaywormhole above a major american city new york did that not happened in the last transformers flick ah yes but the city of choice was chicago i went to see it because the rating was high i was fooled i still believe a good movie deserves a good plot if you like movies that look and feel like a video game with the cheat mode on this is for you but if your iq is above 80 or youre more then 12 years of age and looking for a plot dont look here,fantasy
i find it hard to believe that a film which was mostly made on a computer has such a high average rating does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making is 95 cgi with a plot that is staggering in its stupidity and unoriginality two of the socalled superheroes have no super qualities at all  unless having funny coloured eyes and firing soupedup arrows or running around in a tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting a lot qualify as super powers all black widow does is what emma peel did 45 years ago  and half as well ie kick ass even worse the two best and most interesting marvel characters iron man and hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is samuel l jacksone uncanny ability to find high grossing movie trash to take a stroll through without making the least effort and pick up a fat cheque at the other end now that is a super power,fantasy
from time to time i have the gift of unique movie audiences ive watched the brady bunch in an after school audience of teen and preteen la girls down the road from where i live is the pat robertson school of film where most students believe they are in a fight with the devil and film is a most powerful tool for jesus and i can feel that in the response to certain films my home theater is in the midst of a significant military area so i sit next to warriors and their families when wondering about the war movies i see this includes the socalled seal team six and all the navy pilots in the mideastbut the most precious of shared dark space is when i am in shanghai i saw this film there the only nonasian in the crowd  other than the 7 year old i was with then after a period of reflection rewatched the empire strikes backso i saw this film about the clash and merger of different worlds and dimensions while in full swim with that dynamic myself chinese officials block access to imdb so this comment will be posted on my leavingthe star wars films the first of them anyway demand only two extensions of the universe beyond a projection into the future we assume that the future or we did then would include large machines space travel and expanded notions of universal governance there is no particular need to modify what we accept as the world we live in on that account the notion of the force and how it is woven into jungian family dynamics was the big leap the thing that forces us to stretch our universe i think i understand the appeal of this across ages and culturesthe marvel universe requires a different set of expansions the time is now yet we have world government and massive military machines and the same anachronistic limit on weapons there has been no advance in weapon technology guns and swords we no longer need monsters to be designed to that actors can suit up but even the cgi characters inherit this limit but because they have to engage in handtohand combat well be asked only to assume beings more or less like us but ugly and big machines they have the same notions of weapons swords guns blasters we have in both the real world and the cinematic scifi worldthese limits ask little of us but they limit the battles to be that same old crap we have seen hundreds of times before the only thing marvel could have brought was competence whelon does thatwhere marvel asks us to extend our universe is in the acceptance of complete independent other worlds these are not just different planets with the same physics but different dimensions with as much as the comic artists can imagine different physics this is a big assumption and i suppose only a few enterprises religious ones can pull it off because you have to take the space to define the different laws of the other dimensionsmarvel had a crew of different artists and writers and they did not start out with a combined universe in mind until a few managers until they combined several weak characters to sell more comics stan lee takes the credit for this and i do not know the history well enough to dispute itso we have tony stark who really asks that we believe that the reach of technology will expand we have several marvel characters that also require only that we accept normal scientific accidents radiationbased usually the main disruptive device here is a crystal that asks only that we believe it emits some unknown radiation this is only a cousin to the mysteries of the lhc that takes care of fury iron man hulk and captain america hawk and widow are just spies with extraordinary training along the lines of batmanthor loki asgard and the creatures from yet a third dimension are what expands this we are asked to believe in an open manyworld universe not other planets as with superman not humanmastered magic harry potter the jedi dr strange but other worlds i credit lewis carroll with making this possiblehaving said that what whelon does is allow the character interplay to be a reflection that is folded commentary on these assumptions everyone among the 8 or so members of the team looks at and questions the worlds of the other this is where the chinese context comes in i suppose in the us captain america is seen as partly a joke what we shorthand as only a cartoon but here that distinction is lost  especially as the actor is encouraged to take his role seriously here what we have is team america taken seriouslywhat is seen here  and the china market for hollywood blockbusters is as large as the us market  is a dullwitted goodhearted american soldier taking command he is manipulated by the government and military leaders and supplied with the most extraordinary technology he even  and no one should be surprised by this  has access to the powers of the other worlds the blond hair and germanic manner really stand out hereoh and the redheaded girl with the spotty past guile and commitment to do goodi have no idea what effect this will have on global audiences the marvel franchise is now as powerful as that of star wars and potter and much more able to be mapped to current events fury even references them but i can tell you that this was a thrilling experience to see this with the additional fold of the audience some of whom looked away from me when leaving the theaterteds evaluation  3 of 3 worth watching,fantasy
i went into this movie with high expectations i avoided reviews and went in unspoiled i am a fan of the iron man movies but i didnt see the newest hulk movie thor or captain america this movie seemed to be lacking in character development and back story that make movies like the first iron man xmen and the dark knight exceptional it felt like i should have done my homework before seeing this one this movie had a lot of action but i never felt connected to the characters i hadnt seen before  captain america thor the scarlett johanssen character and the jeremy renner character the hulk was very inconsistent as well in some parts of the movie he was uncontrollable and in other parts he was a team player and how did hawk eye take so long run out of arrows my idea of a great movie is that you get to know the characters through the movie itself i shouldnt be expected to watch four or five other movies to get it i enjoyed it just not as much as i would have expected both my wife and i needed to get to the credits see get the character names of black widow and hawk eye ill go back and watch those other movies and maybe ill appreciate it more,fantasy
marvels is everything a movie should be and more it goes without saying that its the best film of the year to date theres a serious subtext to the story and great characterization throughout but its focus is on the amazing as an adventure film it really has no parallel when a movie reinvents a popular genre it speaks volumes this movie does just that and accomplishes what theyve promised us since the first iron man movie giving us that bigger universe in all its glory the movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting coupled with the writing meaning that every character has the perfect dialogue and every quality actor inhabits the hero they portray perfectly downey has stark down cold but we knew that already hes just given the right stage to shine here evans finds his pathos and his chops in this film as steve rogers the boy scout allamerican has an edge this time around hemsworths thor has understandable rationale for joining and doing what he does throughout the movie his inner turmoil and guilt is exquisite tom hiddleston certainly has the acting chops to hang with any movie villain ever and hes perfect because this is no one dimensional character and his motivation and progression since the thor film is seen and felt samuel l jackson actually has something to do in this movie praise be jeremy renner is a nice addition and even with all the big guns chewing up every scene he shines movie goers will want to see more of his character in the future guaranteed scarlett johansson adds to the casting perfection shes every bit the complex yet sexy female lead and a match for any male on screen would you expect any less from a joss whedon film the interaction conflictturmoil and the relationships all work well and is definitely one of the highlights of the entire movie itselfadd some of the best kickbutt action sequences that ive ever seen and is what other movies will be measured to in the years that follow,fantasy
joss whedon pulled off what many said could not be done he created a super hero epic with a team of superheroes many excuses have been used over the years it will be too expensive and never recoup the cost too many plots to tie together every actoress will want to be the major focus and blah blah blah but now everyone knows it can be done and done wellthe scope of this project was years in the making starting with iron man back in 2008 followed by the incredible hulk captain america and thor these movies filled in the back story for all but three of the characters in the hawkeye the black widow and nick fury even though nick fury shows up in all of the movies and black widow and hawkeye make guest appearance in iron man and thor respectively this back story allows joss to focus on the plot of this movie instead of having to explain how all the heroes came to bethere is not an actor or actress in this movie that didnt pull off their role excellently i am not sure whether this is do the quality of actors or joss whedons devotion to comic books and his directing prowess i think the surprise in this film though has to go to the hulk and bruce banner played by mark ruffalo he had just the right amount of innocence and hidden angst as banner and his one liners as the hulk were spot on another discovered gem although we saw her before in iron man was scarlett johansson as the black widow her ability to use her supposed feminine frailty as a weapon was a surprise each time it was usedthe villain loki played by tom hiddleston was outstanding as well loki and the alien menace he contacted were the perfect combination to threaten the entire planet and bring together the worlds greatest heroes to defend their homeif you do not know this it probably means you have been living under a rock in movie land almost all comic moves now have a hidden easter egg after the credits this movie had two such easter eggsi cant say enough good things about this movie so if you havent seen it and you consider yourself a comic book fan then you should be banned from all geek fests hence forth until you have seen this movie for all the rest of you out there  go see this moviethe panel votes cthulhu 10 out of 10 thanos is awesome i am so excited i killed 300 dreamers on the cruise ship atlantis when it floated too close to the lost city of rlyeh fuzzy toad 8 out of 10 comic book violence is high and children under 8 might get scared of the hulk and alien invaders if they are a fan of comic books however i am sure they will love it mouthbreather 12 out of 10 omg omg best movie ever and i told all you losers hulk could beat thor fratboy bob 10 out of 10 scarlett johannson is delicious the action was awesome puny god lmao the queen in yellow 7 out of 10 still tired of comic book movies but this one is very exciting azathoth googol out of infinity whispers of madness in the dark super spoiler alert for those of you who have not seen the movie do not read past herei think one of the best part of the villainy is who was revealed at the end of the movie the true menace to mankind and a power that dwarfs that of loki and quite possibly the themselvesthe first easter egg showed us who the villain behind loki was in this movie and who will be the villain in the next movie that villain is thanos the lover of death herselfthe second easter egg you have to see for yourself,fantasy
i watched it for the fourth time yesterday in theaters on 3d and damni love this film to bits and it just keeps getting better with each subsequent viewing it is hands down the best experience ive had at the theater in yearsiron man thor hulk loki fury hill widow hawkeye coulson etc having all these larger than life characters in a single movie can be a daunting task and could have gone wrong rather easily but the film manages to make it work perfectly by balancing all the characters so that none of them feel like filler or as being disregarded due to undue attention being given to other characters all are presented and introduced well have their chance to shine and to show us about themselves and they all ad something of substance to the film from maria hill to nick fury to thor and iron man each one of them has their moment in the film and are portrayed in such a way that the audience can relate to themwhile the story is indeed simple to critique the film on this aspect is to miss the point as the purpose of the story is to get everyone together to fight a common goal which is the driving idea behind the initiative on that count the story works wonderfully and the drama and tension is rather created by the characters who are the focus and forte of the film their interaction chemistry and motivations are what drive the film and draws you in they are all drawn and presented so well that you end up loving and actually caring for these characters and like a good friend whose company you enjoy you just want to see them again and again something which plays into the replay value of the film which to my mind is incredibly highfor a film that depends so much on its characters it is essential that the actors portraying them do a good job and on this front the movie excels as well everyone brought their agame to the film and did a wonderful work with their respective characters robert was great as usual as tony stark and ruffalo with his very nuanced performance is hand down the best bannerhulk to ever grace a film his chemistry with robert in their scenes on the helicarrier was amazing as well hiddleston shows an incredible range on his portrayal of loki most noticeably in his scenes with thor in the mountains hemsworth is also great here and with black widow when he is captured in the helicarrier scarlett in particular surprised me after a bit of a one note performance in iron man 2 she brings more depth and a more human side to her character in this film specially in her scenes with bannerhulk where we see her show a fearfulvulnerable side of her character jeremy is always great and this doesnt changes with his portrayal of hawkeye as was jackson with nick fury all in all everyone did great in terms of acting in this filmthe heroes in particular whom we first met in their respective solo films are shown here to have evolved since we last met them from captain americas feelings as being a man out of time who is trying to find his own purpose in this new world he just woke up in to thors more mature albeit still conflicted nature due to his love for loki to a loki who is confident more menacing and determined than the confused loki we left in thor to tony stark who is now in the clean energy business and is more than meets the eye to a banner who is now in control of his other guy but who wonders why he survived the incident all the heroes show more depth and complexity than they did in the previous films you add to this the humanity of black widow fury hill coulson and hawkeye and you have an incredible rich and wide palette of texture within the film and like a great painting it is all balanced out perfectlythis great balance between the characters that the film achieves is seen as well in its action sequences the film has two big action scenes the one in the helicarrier and the other in the city and in both we can see all the heroes jumping into the action and even achieving something worthwhile the action sequences are also very well choreographed and edited with none of the mindless fast cut editing or excessive slowmotion clich that is so common in many of todays films you can easily follow and keep track of whats going on during each scene one of my favorite parts is the virtuoso sequence during the final act where the camera continuously follows the action from one avenger to the next starting with black widow then following iron man who joins up captain america then iron man passing through hawkeye whose arrow then the camera follows to where thor and hulk are fighting it truly shows how all of them are working together fulfilling their respective roles as thethe script of the film is fantastic as is the dialog and along with the films pacing very tight all scenes have a purpose and feel like mini pieces that could stand on their own specially the ones during the first part of the film where each of the heroes is being introduced the scenes lead beautifully to one another tied in by the dialog and at no point does one feels like the film is dragging or that some particular scene is fillerthe has it all the film manages to provide an amazing mix of action humor and drama that keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end and when the film ends you just feel like watching it all over again,fantasy
this movie is meant for those 8 and up it is also meant for those who like scifi fantasy the a group of single comic book heroes get together to save the world from lokki samuel jackson the head of the earths protective forces plays his role well the characters are shallow but lets face it its comic book time it is fast paced and contains interesting toys and gadgets it works as a great party movie i loved the sets the colors and the characters all in one film thor even comes to the rescue all in all the movie is very entertaining and is well worth its greater than 2 hour booty killer time get a bowl of pop corn and a group of friends turn this movie into a scifi party i give it 5 thumbs up,fantasy
the aka assemble is written and directed by joss whedon with zak penn cowriting the story it stars robert downey junior chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddlestone clark gregg samuel l jackson cobie smulders and stellan skarsgard music is scored by alan silvestri and cinematography by seamus mcgarveyasgardian outcast loki hiddlestone has struck a deal with the chitauri to exchange the tesseract for an army with which he can attack earth and thus control it with the earth in mortal danger shield director nick fury jackson activates the initiative a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who if they can actually come together as one united force hold the fate of the earth in their handsi have no real frame of reference with the comic book world when i was young i read a bit of spidey batman and was kind of partial to the fantastic four but i really dont remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life i love movies and as i enter the later stages of my forties im pleased to say i have a wide range of film genre interests i have very much enjoyed the solo films so far with the exception of iron man 2 which quite frankly is average at best but the reality is that if the failed as a movie that whedon got it so wrong then i wouldnt be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of hollywood as it is with one or two minor irks aside the is about as much fun as i have had with a movie in quite a few yearsi wouldnt know if the makers got the essence right or if the story is at one in the marvel universe i just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office even trumping the dark knight rises in that department its a film full of derringdo heroics ripe witticisms wonderfully staged action simmering sexual tensions ego collisions charm heart and splendid human interactions it looks fabulous on bluray the art design the colour photography and silvestris score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning just as a super hero movie score should do the cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be while whedon with a weight of expectation akin to atlas holding the world on his shoulders comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting armyflaws jacksons nick fury could have done with more screen time and cobie smulders is sadly short changed as well the chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers not because of any great alien design and well the hulk cgi hasnt really advanced much from the 2008 version but really these are small itches rather than big ones is the the best film of 2012 it will be seen as such for many fans of the sources who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes and that notion really shouldnt irk the more highbrow film fans out there me no it isnt the best film of 2012 but as i found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy and i caressed my ribs from laughing out loud i knew then that undoubtedly the is the most fun film of 2012 910,fantasy
with all the positive reviews and wordofmouth about this movie not to mention the box office receipts i went into this movie expecting to be wowed im talking wowed along the lines of what i was having left the theater the first time i saw the dark knight i waited and waited and waited i was never wowednow this wasnt a bad movie by any means  it just didnt come anywhere close to being as good as it was advertised iron man and the hulk were scenestealers hawkeye capt america and black widow were ok and every time thor had to utter a line it made me want to cringe his character was so overacted by chris hemsworth but most disappointing of all the villain was a total wimp  not scary not menacing and not cool whatsoever not to mention the regurgitated plot lines alien takeover yeah didnt see that in the final transformers installment loki being captured wasnt that part of the jokers plan in tdk etc overall not a bad movie  but lower your expectations its fun and entertaining but not a whole lot else,fantasy
one thing that i do not understand is how people could hate on this wonderous mashup in film history first time it has ever been done on a comicbook scale like this the story has a working heart tons of action and a sense of humor all around a basiccomic book story which some people tend to rebuke however with the basic plot it preserves the films sanity for with a complex and darker plot the film would contain that of a messy fashion hands down one of the greatest movies i have ever seen being a dc fanatic and a comicbook reader i acknowledge the greatness that sparks out of this film dont listen to what some mistaken others say watch this amazing movie and watch it at the proper guidelines expecting a simple actionpacked cinematic marvel the main villain loki provides some of the best villainy ive seen following heath ledger as joker,fantasy
i watched but i couldnt t like it very much this is action movie but i could see action just twenty minutes shortly 15 action 10 mythology 75 dialog in my opinion captain america movie is ok hulk movies is ok iron man movies ok shield movie is ok but heros team movie is poor than othersthis is movie which you can watch in your spare time 86 rating is too much for this movie it can be around 5 average also movie action scenes look like computer game trailer movie story is better than movie digitized action scenes this movie hasnt got story enough,fantasy
finally the have hit our screens its taken a long time to put this movie together this idea is apparently 15 years in the making i collected marvel comics back in school and the idea of having some of my favourite superheroes in one film was a celluloid dream i wanted to become realised 20 years later that dream has been realised i am more than happy to report that marvel has surpassed my expectations with this goliath of a superhero film the is an excellent movie one i recommend you see more than once if you can afford it in the cinemaeach of our heroes has their own introduction from black widow beating up her captors after an interrogation to thor surrounded by lightning hijacking a plane to take his imprisoned brother loki we more or less know who the heroes are but it would help to watch the previous marvel films to avoid confusion regarding the story behind the antagonists and protagonists when the team finally assembles as the title suggests they dont all get on with each other cap has an issue with iron man bruce banner does his best to restrain the power of the hulk nick fury has a hidden agenda and thor thinks everyone is petty as well as tiny it takes an attack on the shield hq and a major tragedy before they decide they must band together to fight loki and the chitauriso where do i start from start to finish every one of the heroes gets their moment in the sun but if i were to list my 3 favourites it would be hulk iron man and captain america hulk for starters is just classic hulk hulk crash and hulk smash everything we saw do in the hulk in the first two films and more as the hulk is given full reign to let loose on the bad guys one scene in particular where the hulk takes on loki will have you laughing out of your chair mark ruffalo does a great job as banner he shows a wittier side to the character than any of the other actors in the previous hulk films in fact hes more reminiscent of how bill bixby played banner in the tv series robert downey jr continues to affirm why he was chosen as iron mantony stark hes naturally a funny man and im sure joss whedon allowed him to improvise some of his scenes just great in every scene funny charismatic and handles the dramatic scenes with such ease chris evans as captain america is perfect casting brought a natural leadership quality to his character but at the same time he makes clearly evident that cap is still learning and adjusting to the new world he lives in evans is growing as an actor and his performance in this wont do his cv any harm at allchris hemsworth owns thor his walk the way he talks and how he interacts with his team again hemsworth like the rest showing his was the best choice to play his character jeremy renner and scarlett johansson get a lot of screen time hawkeye and black widow are the only non powered heroes but are very good at what they do in this interpretation they are agents for shield who have a history together the chemistry between the two is great without there being any sexual tension they two work well together and really brought depth to their characters samuel l jackson my favourite actor just owns the nick fury character and has such presence its a shame he misses out on the grand finale the grand finale is just awesome im talking first transformers movie awesome almost the whole of new york gets decimated whilst the battle the chitauri this is where you see the team finally come to together and bring the fight to loki who by the way is played brilliantly by tom hiddleston a really nasty piece of work and quite mischievous too especially with the way he plays with like rooks on a chess board a great villain played by a gifted actor the set pieces are just well filmed and well executed joss whedon the man behind buffy the vampire slayer and firefly has just outdone himself here has a good story and such a wonderful well balanced script and its also very funny youll probably find that this is one of the funniest films of the year zak penns writing just works well with the story and joss whedons direction is perfect for a film such as this even in scenes where you might sense a little drag the dialogue is good enough to carry those scenes no shaky cam scenes bizarre off tone moments or any ang lee story board action scenes like the first hulk movie it focuses on the characters their personal battles and the jobs they have to do to keep the world safetheres nothing i didnt like apart from one corny cringeworthy scene involving iron man but everything else was fine just fine all in all the is the superhero movie ive been waiting for 20 years to happen marvel has done an amazing job with all these films and the scene mid credits just made me want even more so i really hope the sequel happens and i hope joss whedon returns to film it i cant praise this movie enough and i recommend highly for fan boys and those who love movies in general films like the assemble are why i go to the movies and why i love films go see this now also love the soundgarden song at the end,fantasy
the best superhero movie ever its entertaining fresh humorous and clever all the superheros who appear in the film are fantastic they are all included in the film equally so you dont really get the sense of a main character which is goodcaptain america was awesome he takes leadership of the team during the end fight scene which is really cool we see him really kick some ass in this film but i felt his costume looked a little rubbish compared to his original costume in captain americathor didnt fail to impress his costume was awesome but would of liked to of seen him wear his helmet in both the and his own film like he does in the comics his fight scene with hulk was crazy so good iron man was awesome he provided witty sarcasm that lightened the mood he had some incredible action scenes and the special effects of his costume attaching itself to him in mid air was incrediblei didnt think after watching the film that the hulk would be my favorite character but he was the film really changed when the hulk was unleashed he was destructive and powerful and was a force to be reckoned with in the film the fight scene between him and loki was hilarious well if you call it fighting it was more like hulk playing with a toy black widow was wicked had some bad ass fighting moves which contributed to the film massively and she was super hot and had some kick ass fight scenesi didnt really think the movie needed hawkeye but i was wrong he was a really cool addition to the film and featured in the storyline massively and had some awesome action scenes at the end i didnt think there was ever going to be a superhero movie which rivaled that of the dark knight but there is and its called assemble,fantasy
 assemble as a 21 year old marvel fancomic fan ive been looking forward to this movie since the announcement of its production and im happy to report that my excitement wasnt in vain ive always said that an epic movie must make you want to immediately see it again and the has done just thatone of the many things that i loved about this movie was that it is obvious that the production team has taken time to research avenger comics and cartoons i have seen many criticisms made by the general public of a certain character hulk and about how he is different from the last two films what these people dont realise is that the way the hulk is portrayed in the is the way he was created by stan lee  co if anything the hulk is proof of the hard work and dedication that the production team has put in to making this moviei could go on and on about the film but im not i just recommend everyone to see it in cinema perferably in 2d as 3d suck in my opinion assemble is the best film ive ever seen   so far stay tuned for dark knight rises,fantasy
i went into this movie with very high expectations cause i watched all the trailers about 30 times each i will say from the very first 10 minutes of the films i was instantly blown away by the action and the course of the story all the characters in this film get an equal amount of screen time which is usually the problem in a film where you deal with multiple characters such as in this film i applaud joss whedon for making this marvel masterpiece the way everything fits together in this film is truly amazing and its close to impossible to find any holes in the story mr whedon was the perfect person to have dealt with telling this story as hes a comic book fan he nailed it 100 i believe im going to see this film again tomorrow it is just that awesome hulk will give you a fun time in this film watch out,fantasy
 all right assemble if you insist is really quite extraordinarily good its pretty much everything thats fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen  i was hoping for as much from joss whedon and he deliveredlike serenity and the buffy season 5 finale its extremely wellstructured so that everyone gets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes i cant think of another action movie that has so many characters and is so wellbalanced between them all and all the different combinations of arguments and teamups between themits also extremely funny but mostly not in that trademark joss whedon buffyspeak way that some very wrong people find precious and annoying it has better tony stark dialogue than either iron man movie having said that the funniest gags are visual ones that involve the hulki often complain that superhero films weakest parts tend to be their climactic action sequences the stakes are raised and believability is strained well for once we have a superhero film whose best action scene comes at the end its one of the bestsustained action finales since the matrix  and much betterdirected than the incomprehensible shots of the dark knight its constantly spectacular and contains countless satisfying moments in both action and dialogue  most of which also happen to be very funnybut the best single scene in the whole film isnt an action scene a standard phrase joss whedon has used in promotional interviews is i wanted to figure out why all these different characters should even be in the same room as each other well that scene where they are all in the same room as each other turned out to be the films absolute highlight scenes like that are what ill look forward to on subsequent viewings there have been lots of action films that ive enjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to rewatch because that they didnt have much else going for them avatar comes to mind  but this isnt one of themthe films plot isnt exactly intricate its extremely tightly focused around the macguffin from thor and captain america however this isnt a bad thing in a film of this scale ensuring the characterisation and action is satisfying is an ambitious balancing act as it is without adding a complex twistyturny plot to the mix as wellthe film doesnt carry any sort of larger realworld message its really just a movie about these specific characters  about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other but as far as movies about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other go well its hard to imagine how they could get much better,fantasy
i am a huge marvel fan while i havent read most of the comics in years i still enjoy the characters stan lee is a genius and it is wonderful to see his creations coming to the big screen and not be a poor bad acted cheesy knock off this movie says it all it shows everyone exactly why they love these comics and that is simply that we can all be more than the sum of what we are or perceive ourselves to be the prior movies are also very close to my heart iron man sold me on robert downing jr again as an actor and someone who can rise above rdj personifies iron man perfectly there is no other actor that could ever come close the turmoil he has in this movie the battle between his ego and doing what is right despite personal loss is well its a work of pure art chris hemsworth once again shows the world that a man can play a god he does it with grace and strength and with my humble opinion a human element knowing that while he is stronger than all of his counterparts physically except hulk he is also weak he gives a character that could have easily have been a i am better than you because i am a god a sense of humanity and humility thor is a protector of earth and he protects her with a fierce resolve mark ruffalo while i was a bit disappointed that ed norton would not be playing hulk i was happy and thrilled with the choice mr ruffalo shows all aspects of the hulk with smooth fluid motion the anger he has to contain the control he has he should teach a class on anger management he shows what i believe to be a true hulk the human that fights the beast within who among us can say we dont have a little of that in us chris evans he was the torch a cocky show off that loved the lime light i was worried about him being a soldier the soldier when i saw captain america i was blown away by his scope something he continues to bring to this movie he portrays the captain as a soldier a soldier out of time and yet he is quick to adapt and lead a group of people that you wouldnt imagine could be a team he honors captain america with his portrayal of him jeremy renner i havent seen many of his movies but the ones i have i have enjoyed immensely he took a character that could have easily been just a side note and made him shine showing the elements you would expect to see in an assassin i truly hope that we get to see a solo act for him i think it would be worth it scarlett johansson continues to portray the black widow with skill and grace she is beautiful and deadly the perfect black widow maybe a movie with her and jeremy renner something to think about samuel l jackson as nick fury was inspired and in this film you actually get to see more than just nick fury popping in for some advice giving and then popping back out he shows that nick fury is a bad ass to be reckoned with even standing up to those in charge when he knows their decision is wrong clark gregg aka agent coulson i will tell you the truth here i thought he was nothing more than a filler but he nearly stole the show for me he did an incredible job and has in all of these films he shows an agent that is direct and very much a man in black but then you find that he well he has the biggest heart and he delivers it with a fantastic dry wit the entire movie was bound together effortlessly with poise and that sense that we as lowly humans will not back down in the face of impending death but will fight it until there is no more of usthe last person i want to mention is joss whedon i love this genius this man who can seamlessly put danger action and humor together he did it with buffy angel and firefly i admire his work to the point that i will watch anything and everything of his he was the perfect choice for this and i can wait to see what he comes up with nextthe overview of this movie is simply words can no do it justice it was not just a movie it was truly an experience you are sucked into the story shown by so many different aspects i have been disappointed with some of the comic movies xmenfinal stand comes to mind someone please tell me where in the xmen comics did charles die last i checked he didnt and with those disappointments comes that lingering feeling of doubt that the movie will not live up to its hype i was thrilled that not only did the live up to its hype it surpassed it i have only one humble request that the next one have spiderman and wolverine i recommend this movie to everyone as it is the personification of why we go to movies and why this business is a multibillion dollar one that we all need to escape our tired lives for a little while and be swept away to a world where just for two hours everything makes sense the bad guys always lose and the good guys win with style ,fantasy

the shot of all the standing in the circlethat sold it for me this is as good and fun as a superhero movie can getits too good to spoil joss whedon takes four different visions of directors and makes it his own this is the ultimate pay off for marvels five years of planning and hard work the team dynamics whedon captured perfectly in firefly are in full display here every person has motive and a relation with the other special mention to the hulk you literally dont see anything when he is on the scree this is the peak of entertainment the stunning action the witty dialog makes it irresistible makes it fun to be a geek if you like intelligent humor thrilling story and larger than life action in your movie then is for you there were claps cheers and shouts all around in the cinema in this day when you think you have seen it all thats an achievement in itself how i wish it were 3 hrs long dont miss it,fantasy
the is a brilliant cartoon with tremendous flair style and more than its share of silliness director joss whedon is allowed free reign to present a massive spectacle of action and destruction and it is often very visually spectacular and often more than fun is the the comic book masterpiece awaited for years by geeks everywhere no it isnt even marvels best offering as an independent studio the only level the really succeeds on is being a huge cartoon it offers nothing truly unique in realm of dealing with these characters or their mythology if the modern day comic book is a romanticized colorful dissection of hero worship and good and evil as i and a great many comic book fans like to think it is than joss whedon has ultimately failed in respecting that and using it to give his audiences something to chew on in a great many ways i found myself brought back to the horrendous experience last summer of watching another huge action spectacle transformers dark of the moon the is in many ways the same movie neither have any sense of stakes other than to make sequels iron man captain america the incredible hulk and thor are here to sell toys and ticketsepicness is what is on the table in this film and joss whedon surely does deliver an epic action packed film delivering an action packed film isnt all that hard to do though there are no stakes to the missing is a sense of dread and threat i wanted our heroes to really be tested by something bigger than themselves and they arent i sing the praises of christopher nolans the dark knight and you know what jon favreaus first iron man film because they truly brought our characters to a point where they had to question what made them heroes and if being a hero was more than just paraphernalia both films created tremendously strong villains which served as representations of all that could be corrupted and made evil within the title heroes the threat in the comes in the form of a pretty lame mcguffin we find out next to nothing about the tesseract cube other than it can blow stuff up in a michael bayesque fashion the threat to our heroes is pretty dull and lackluster often our heroes have to spend time reminding us they are saving the world because we forget i wanted to be reminded that our heroes bleed and can die kill off a sacrificial lamb and keep me interested i know the retort here about clark greggs agent coulson and he is a very fun character but he merely serves as a second rate sidekicki think every actor in here is having a blast in their roles and i love seeing it i dont necessarily think they are all taking their roles seriously but i do think they are engaging all the great things that make these characters pulp icons my favorite performance has to be tom hiddleston as loki loki isnt all that rounded a villain or character but hiddleston loves the comic book nature of the character saying you want to take over the world often is a silly empty threat and yet if someone says it the right way it is funthe final battle scene is grand as promised is it fun yes that is something i do want to reiterate because the film is fun there is something to be said about enjoying eye candy and things blowing up the is a masterpiece if that is what we are concerned with does the battle go on too long i didnt check my watch nearly as much as i did during dark of the moon but yes it is drawn out i think i wouldnt feel this way though had the problems mentioned earlier been addressed the chitauri are just plot pieces and even though we see our heroes take some hits never do we see any real toil this has on them what is the a cartoon the kid in me was satisfied with all the action but the adult in me wanted morei think with the we have a cinematic rorschach with everyone getting something they want out of it and rating it much higher than it truly deserves i saw it opening weekend and have pondered over it amidst the fanfare is it a good film yes if you hold it up as a summer blockbuster it is an exceptional fun filled ride is it a substantive film no if you want a substantive comic book film than see the dark knight or iron man,fantasy
i could say that the footage we all have seen from doesnt do it justice i mean you could thought that im lying but hell no i have to say that i was truly skeptical about this film but i was damn wrong joss whedon has pulled off one of the best superhero flicks ive ever seen it does not hit the dark knight but its the best marvel studios film so far anyway the was epic good writing good performances good action scenes my god its really great action packed that unite cap iron man thor and hulk hulk really hit it off one of the greatest surprises of the film i guess even haters will enjoythat is all,fantasy
as i finished watching the the main thought in my head was why on earth did they get joss whedon to write this whedon is a master of witty earthy dialogue and anyone whos ever watched buffy angel or firefly knows that he can direct action scenes and powerful interpersonal character connections often in the same scene who directed this bland onedimensional shootemup and what have you done with joss whedon this humorless cgi fest could have been handled by any number of robotic hollywood hacks i looked forward to this movie because i was over the moon with excitement at the thought that it couldnt be a typical jumpcut screaming video game and thats pretty much what we have here the jokes are flat and the dialogue is embarrassing i thought scarlett johannsson was charming and i usually dont like her too much but even worse is how the always incredibly watchable mark ruffalo was rendered a total snooze how is that possible robert downey is sarcastic as always and fun to watch but god it was just so not good a real letdown all around like potential greatness flattened and made super dumb by the hollywood crap machine,fantasy
while i found the action and story decently pleasing overall i think the movie spread itself incredibly thin in terms of characterization and as such suffers from a distinct lack of personality i understand that marvel thought they could forego character development because each character had their own movie with the exception of the hulk as this version is a reboot i think that there needs to be a lot more going on in order for the characters to be likable all of the dialogue is either puns oneliners or witticisms as if the movie is one big joke and the actors are constantly winking at the audience the action and story are pleasing and well thought out but the characters are completely lacking,fantasy
i am a marvel fan comic or movie this one really made the year for me in marvel films specifically robert downey jr he stole the show here with the best performance ever he got everything down to starks arrogance eccentricity and excellence hats off to him this has compiled every aspect of a total avenger movie what can i say its got gut humor and convincing transitions that keep you glued to the end and i have got to say this now or never finally the hulk speaks i have been waiting years for that the one punch liner totally blew me i will spare bruce banner roles as mark ruffalo really came out doing a good job here chris hemsworth no doubt is thor to me and is perfect chris evans is great for a guy lost in time scarlett johansson with her very flexible talent and shine who will argue with me on that jeremy renner nailed it tom hiddleston is perfect for loki clark gregg was cool and had a vital role here lastly but not the least samuel l jackson you are the man the rest of the cast was seamless for me and they all did a splendid job the special effects is explosive it keeps me wanting for more im a sucker for sfx its a comic book story and its what i got and wanted all these years i cant wait for another avenger movie,fantasy
i enjoyed the movie not sure i understand all the platitudes its getting here i guess some people are just a bit over stimulatedthe movie couldve done with a 20 minute cut towards the end to avoid going into micheal bay territory maybe this time could have been used to further develop the characters and how they relate to each otherthe plot was also pretty weak sometimes it was hard to figure out whether it was transformers 2 or the such was the similarity of pretty much everything at the end including the aliens and cgia solid 610,fantasy
all i can say is wow after watching patiently every superhero movie since the original superman in 1978 most of them many times i realize now that this was the one i have been waiting for to say it was great would be incredibly unjust  there arent many words to really convey just how special it is from the casting to the performances to the writing to the fine details to the effects to the dynamic interplay of the characters this movie is simply hands down the best superhero movie ever made i wont give any of it away and there were too many moments to even begin to describe anyway but i will for sure be going back to see it at least a couple more times which i never doand its one of the very few i will for sure purchase when it is available instant classic and a defining moment for the superhero movie genre on the way out of the imax 3d theater where i saw it beyond being simply stunned i had 2 further immediate thoughts 1 it was so mindnumbing and so far above any superhero movie i have ever seen that it reminded me of seeing the 1st lord of the rings movie fellowship and how i was similarly stunned and literally dazed upon exiting the cinema 2 i cant for the life of me figure out why the powers that be at dc have not yet come out with a justice league movie in a similar ensemble fashion  their management is asleep at the wheel if that is not in development anyway back to the movie itself go see it multiple times you will thank me later,fantasy
my inner child is something i value most and that inner child remembers my days of being a little kid and playing with my iron man and captain america toys as well as wishing i was the incredible hulk i also remember watching the hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next captain america comic books so as you can tell im a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood and that being said it was with great excitement that i awaited the having seen all the movies until then and owning them all on bluray i remember even watching them all up until thursday may 3rd which was when the midnight premiere took place my buddy and i even wore iron man masks to the screeningim most happy to report to say the did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement it may just be the best comic book movie ive ever seen it shines dozens of lamps on the dark knight and it makes the previous movies even thor which i loved despite not having been familiar with the thor mythos before seeing it look like the fantastic four movieseverything about this movie was pitch perfect starting with the script joss whedon had penned the script and its obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of the but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about the everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right tony stark was his usual lovable jerk self and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love he was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity captain america was his usual kickass self and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with loki were just amazing particularly the scene near the end on stark tower where he forces loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks is this what you want aso finally the hulk has had justice done hes given a sense of humour which the other movies absolutely failed on im happy to report the movie did not fail there and who can forget the dialogue classic dialogs down to the last inch we need a plan of attack i have a plan attack and whts the matter not fond of thunder and lightning i dont like what comes afterthe characterization is really what counts here too obviously if youre going to a movie called the for a character study youre going to the wrong movie and you need to lay off the artsy movies too as theyre clearly doing serious stuff to your brain but for the type of movie it is its done supremely well each character is unique in their own right ive already mentioned the eponymous superheroes but black widow is one sexy and fun character thats hard not to love her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when possessed by loki then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some loki buttthe movie is also one of the funniest movies ive ever seen thanks to lots of clever whedonian humour and appropriately placed comic book style exaggeration the scene where hulk smashes loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in 21 jump street and any other comedy this year and the scene where hulk sucker punches thorthe performances are amazing as well pure commitment from all involved with downey jr evans and hemsworth as well as johannson smulders jackson hiddleston and renner giving amazing performances all but ruffalo is the real surprise here he brought something new to the table here as hulk every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hard to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling his monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully he was the biggest surprise and got everything about the hulk perfect props to ruffalo for finally getting the hulk exactly rightim going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise whedon is my favourite tv writer and hes managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd justice was done to the best superheroes ever and i can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again a big thanks to ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making this movie possible and the great success it was ive seen this movie twice already and i cant wait to see it again and again now ive only got two more words to say assemble,fantasy

dont get me wrong avatar was really great but are superb entertainment the acting was outstanding and the effects are on the mark and im a stickler for special effectsbest action movie so far this year and it will be hard to top well worth the outrageous prices they have to charge at the theaters for popcorn and soft drinks i took my nephew with me he loves his hulk with some popcorn and a pop joss whedon did an excellent job especially with some of the more unusual camera angles the playing off of thors gf was smart but might have made for another interesting side love like tony stark had with pepper all in all i had never been so entertained with a movie in my life ps the comic punches in the movie really hit the spot,fantasy
there are absolutely no words to describe the full percentage of enjoyment i received from this movie the is phenomenal joss whedon beautifully and artfully collaborates all of the greatness and magnitude of all the films leading to this one and directs an near exact adaptation of what marvel always hoped the would look like on the big screen to call this film an utter triumph would be a gross underexaggeration containing some of the best action sequences ever captured on film the wittiest and most hilarious humor i have seen and probably the greatest chemistry between both characters and actors in cinema comic book fans and creators will leave theaters in an ecstasy of awe and amazement may 4 2012 should be marked down in the history books as the day comic book films successfully reached true perfection,fantasy
the fans of the franchise now have another reason to smile this time an even bigger one ever since the trailer of the went on air from that very day i had been watching it daily twice at least already knowing that its got to be a fantastic filmsomewhere i feared that hype often kills itthank god nothing like that happenedinstead i after finally having watched the awesome superhero flick feel that this one was under hypedits a waayyyyyy tooo goooooddd one of the best kickass action flicks everf i dont have words enough to describe the excitement im in right now brilliant it is anyone who has ever read any superhero comic book in his life go see the moviehaving dazzling set designs all amazingly well crafted into one package director joss whedon to my amazement has given this superhero feast a nice new treatment and that is that the despite having been put into genres like actionadventurescifi surprise surprise it is extremely funny tooi knew tony starkaka iron man would be delivering some witty lines here and there but never was i expecting it to be sooo hilarious amazing work6 superheroes the earth to save it has everything a fanboy would ever ask for even moreafter having successfully introduced us to iron man hulk thor captain america in their individual ventures marvel studios have done a brilliantly good job by developing this unbelievable spectacleone more thing that i would specially appreciate about the is that every superhero gets hisher deserving screen space nobody was overshadowingiron man is techy hulk is destructive thor being a demigod it must have been a really difficult task to group them up along with black widow hawkeye and captain america who are already used to obeying orders plus with all that being in place initially they had their egos clashing against one another having all that resolved the enemy is loki brother of thor there were supernatural creatures that had to be blended within the perimeters of the world that had been developed man this would have been one hell of a tough jobspectacular jaw dropping action excellent fun smart and witty dialogues make this superhero extravaganza a treat to watch exceeds all expectationsim still working on believing it it was that good and well i dont know if i should tell this in public but i literally was sitting on the seat like a little child clapping whistling and laughing my lungs out enjoying every scene of the moviethere is sooo much to write about but that would be unnecessary i guess so only one suggestion in the enddont miss thisthis definitely couldnt be any better hats off to joss whedon the cast who delivered their performances with a panache and to the marvel crewthis was by far the most entertaining memorable movie i have seen in my life will cherish this for long i wish i had my friends with mehuh nevermind thego go go,fantasy
i read a few of the other reviews and while some mention the incredible performance loki gives none capture the true brilliance i expect tom hidelston to win an academy award for his role in this story loki is not evil not purely sickeningly evil heath ledger takes top honors for that portrayal as the joker loki is different he has goals motives desires and pride he is above all else mischievous cunning and calculating as he attempts to and temporarily succeeds in turning the worlds greatest heroes against each other he truly delivers one of if not the best performance of the movie and in particular shines a little after an hour into the movie when black widow confronts him on the carrier your ledger is dripping its gushing red and you think saving a man no less virtuous than yourself will change anything this is the basest sentimentality this is a child at prayer pathetic you lie and kill in the service of liars and killers you pretend to be separate to have your own code something that makes up for the horrors but they are a part of you and they will never go away  all other main characters give stellar performances as well the samuel jackson an actor i usually despise brings back all the greatness of pulp fiction except this time bald and with an eye patch captain america dominates every moral issue and though one of the weakest of the team is the greatest unifier and leader among them thor brings back the elegance and civility of a bygone age combining with iron mans sarcasm and cocky swagger in just the right ways to leave everyone grinning and bruce banner finally gets a chance to shine as a brilliant yet conflicted man more than as a raging green beast even black widow and agent caulson have their moments the only slightly disappointing acting was by hawkeye but most of the time hes not fighting hes brainwashed so you expect him to be acting a little strangely anyways and the action incredible once the final battle starts there is no letting up it is brilliant flash after brilliant flash punch by punch hit by deafening glorious hit it never lets up and it is almost impossible not to cry out in excitement i felt like a little kid all over again each team member gets their cameo time fighting off hordes against all odds and then comes scene after scene of team work at one point you follow iron man as he blazes a trail literally through the oncoming horde pausing briefly to help each hero as he rushes by captain america leads the ground assault thor dominates the skies and hulk smashes with such agile speed and deadly efficiency you are left squirming in your seat i am an action junkie and while i found the opening salvos somewhat dull especially the car chase i loved every mini hero battle and almost cried in delight through out the finale the only marvell movie i think that stands up to the as best comic based movie is woverine origins while did have better and more exciting action including the finale origins had a more heart wrenching and slightly better told story the end of origins when wolverines love dies in his arms i have a hard time not choking up that gut wrenching heart tearing happyanddyinginsideallatthesametime feeling that make movies like spartacus and romeo and juliet so great that helped make origins great never once came to me in avengeres for that reason i think did not appeal to me as much as it could have i just did not feel it inside like i have other stories overall an excellent movie it started a little slow for me probably because i was so anxious to see the heroes fighting an alien army and while i did find the movie very funny at times i think the trailer kind of ruined it for me there were lines i remembered loving from the trailers that in context were much more serious and hearing all the laughing in the theater even though they were lines i laughed at when i watched the trailers seemed somewhat inappropriate i rarely give out 10 stars but im still riding the adrenaline from the finale even without which im not sure id lower my score to a 9 out of 100 this movie definitely scores somewhere in the 90s,fantasy
the exact dose of characters with much surprise and play a valuable hero the human and nonconformity as a vital force of a cause a perfect black humor and characterization of robert downey jr and mark ruffalo with 15 minutes of electrifying battle incredible and exciting heroes one by one iron man a braggart but risky and a little action selfish ever even thinking of a end highest and love of gwinnett a naive captain america but with a great inspiration and strategic capacity almost a child in battle wonderful thor a demigod but assessing human vulnerability with a fine sense of humor and war hulk as ever fun with a great sense of humor reflects his intelligence and his other hand focused on what we love in this kind of series destruction and unpredictability scarlet divine but not greater role as hawk but no matter they accompany and adorn in a dual process between a shady past and a debt to the world and an evil powerful bright disruptive but above all unpredictable and fun,fantasy

 is a great movie with awesome action and a story that is simple enough to follow it doesnt matter if you have seen earlier marvel movies or not although if you have seen them it will provide great character depth each character gets its own moments  both physically and emotionally but quick witted on liners by iron manrobert downey jr and awesome action pieces by hulk steals the show lokitom hiddleston has his moments to as major super villain the movie has humor and all in the right places the screenplay dialogues and dialogue delivery is very good and action pieces are the kind that you have never scene before especially in last half hourthis movie is epicin short it a movie that you should not miss and if you do you will regret it later well done joss whedon ,fantasy
everything just worked perfectly for the my geek heart jumped several times during the movie so many cool and memorable action scenes great comic timing it is just epic in every way the overall story is simple evil guy wants to dominate earth but it doesnt matter because it still carries depth due to the previous movies which are tied together seamlessly with this one the chemistry between the actors are perfect and skeptics dont worry caps suit is not bad looking at all and there is a perfectly fine explanation for why it does not look as high tech shiny as the rest of the but for that one you need to watch the movie experiences like this is why cinema is still the best place to watch epic action movies and the is nothing but epic,fantasy
i just want to tell you it is a great movie go see it asapwe all have seen a lot of fake 3d movie in the past two years i am very fed up with it i cant believe they charged the same money as the avatar i think some movie makers should pay us back the money we spent but for the it is money well spent the 3d effect is marvelous is the squeal to thor i am very sure  unlike battleship uses john woos style slowly cooking the oven too slow sometimes avenger is like a hot knife cutting the butter  straight to the point i just love itto watch this movie is like riding the worlds best rollercoaster i guarantee you that you will love it as well,fantasy
this is one of the most awaited movies of all time  and for the legions of fans in asia the wait is going to be over soon for those who have not yet booked their tickets i suggest that they do so preferably at the imax cineplex where the action in 3d can be overwhelmingi must say i was a bit skeptical that writerdirector joss whedon creator of tvs buffy the vampire slayer and angel can pull off this sixinone superhero flick will it be like assembling six major egos in a small room  and cramming their style with the plot of six against one loki wouldnt that be overkill and unfair advantage will the storylineplot measure up to the cgi and effects that take up a major part of its us220 million budget will this disney effort follow in the heels of john carter and go downhill all these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie  when we find earth being threatened by demigod loki tom hiddleston and nick fury samuel l jackson the head of shield for strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division starts the avenger initiative from here on it is pure marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order you can bet this one is going to put whedon among the ranks of top directors like spielberg and cameronthose who have seen captain america last year may remember the tesseract the allpowerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean loki the megalomaniacal brother of thor chris hemsworth manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the worldto stop him fury and his assistant natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson assemble the various superheroes on his massive helicarrier in preparation for war against lokis forces these include steve rogers captain america chris evans tony starks iron man robert downey jr dr bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo and thor special agent clint barton or hawkeye jeremy renner makes up the sixth member a bit later when manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monstersthe climactic battle takes up almost all of the final halfhour but the whole movie is absorbing enough thanks to a cleverly written script that incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and selfeffacing wit indeed before the battle the alien invaders they fight one another both physically and verbally like iron mans quips when he first meets thor whats this shakespeare in the park and does your mother know youre wearing her drapes indeed the punchlines are more powerful  and memorable  than the real puncheswhedon does not waste time reintroducing his characters we are already familiar with iron man captain america and thor the physical talents of scarjos black widow are introduced in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss agent coulson on holdi have always wondered how mark ruffalo will fare as the hulk  and i am surprised he almost ran away with the show his dr banner is a mellow guy hiding out in india before being persuaded by natasha to join the on board furys helicarrier we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check  you must have been doing a lot of yoga someone jokes and yes when the hulk emerges it is really incredible also watch out for marvel comics stan lee who gets a selfeffacing oneliner during the action scenesone of the misses of this film is that natalie portmans jane is left out of thors story  except for a picture this is in contrast to starks relationship with pepper potts gwyneth paltrow which takes up quite a few scenes and even though he has to faceoff against six superheroes hiddlestons loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain of course jackson finally has a proper role here after cameos in the previous iron man and captain america filmsit really isnt about whether youre going to catch the its how many times you will want to see it,fantasy
a colossal wave of fevered anticipation has preceded the arrival of marvels the the culmination of five incredibly successful standalone films over the last four years not only has helmer joss whedon not cracked under the immense hype he has amazingly managed to surpass the loftiest expectations with a movie that towers over the rest that have come before it combining jawdropping action tongueincheek humour and poignant drama into a dazzling piece of summer blockbuster entertainment proving that the whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts wheedon has distilled the best elements of each of the preceding movies into this assembly of marvel superheroes iron man is wiry and snarky as ever thor is just as godly in his might but humanly in his compassion and captain america is still appealingly oldschool the hulk or bruce banner in his human form is quite something else altogether though being the only character to have a change of actor from the aforementioned films and very much all the better for it but well save our gushing for laterit shouldnt come as any surprise that the one movie which is most intimately associated with is thor given that both share the same villain thors adopted brother and fellow asgardian loki tom hiddleston and that wheedon did shoot the postcredits scene with loki and shield director nick fury samuel l jackson opening with a recurring character from that movie dr erik selvig stellan skarsgard is now assisting with experiments on the tessaract which has quite unexpectedly displayed a life of its ownturns out that the fallen loki has been drafted by an alien race to lead its invasion of earth using the same tessaract as a portal to cross over from their universe to ours and his arrival not only leads to the decimation of the shield base but also the takeover of hawkeye jeremy renner and dr selvig to do his bidding with the fate of the world in the balance fury activates his initiative to gather the aforementioned superheroes with two others black widow and hawkeye even from the outset its clear that there is organic spontaneity in wheedons storytelling as he fluently weaves together the recruiting exercise by fury and his trusted agent phil coulson clark gregg of the participating superheroes the best he saves for last so even though thor only first appears half an hour into the movie his is a spectacular entrance befitting of that for a god crossing paths with iron man for a thunderous oneonone clash in the middle of the woodstrue to the spirit of the books the assembly of these superheroes begins on a fractious note chiefly due to starks distrust of fury and disdain for the starandstripesoutfitted captain america instead stark teams up with the only person he deigns as his intellectual equal bruce banner to locate the tessaract and uncover what dirty secrets fury has been keeping from the rest of them the answer to the latter isnt all too unexpected but kudos to wheedon for tying this little detail nicely with what happened in thor it will take something colossal to jolt them out of their self centredness and believe us when we say that gamechanger is certainly massive counting for the first of two action setpieces in the movie that will undoubtedly qualify amongst some of the most spectacularly thrilling stuff youll see on the big screen this year and just when you think it couldnt get any better wheedon tops it with an even grander and absolutely breathtaking climax set in the heart of new york citythe reason why the finale works so brilliantly is the same as why the entire movie is that awesome wheedon loves and respects each and every superhero character just as much wheedon gets the action pitchperfect through reinforcing the individual powers of each one of the superheroes before uniting their strengths to form an even mightier coalition it is nothing less than pure ecstasy when they join forces as a team and youll find it difficult to resist getting up from your seat and cheering for them at various points throughout the remarkable finishthis review however wont be complete without a special shoutout for the hulk many fans of whom have been disappointed by both the lee ang and the later louis leterrier iteration of it here wheedon has finally gotten it right blending both the characters brains and brawn to crowdpleasing effect even more so through some clever plotting that ensures banners eventual transformation from man to beast is as rewarding as it should be indeed theres really no reason why you shouldnt be running out and catching this the first instance it opens calling it the perfect summer blockbuster is probably not enough to do justice to just how brilliant it is and well deserving of every superlative we have lavished on it thus far filled with wit humour and incredible action it ranks as one of the most if not the most entertaining and exhilarating experiences youll have at the movies this year,fantasy
the was the first movie i saw in theaters three times and for darn good reason it sets the bar so high for comic book movies dc is was seriously in a lot of trouble after the came out if you have seen each of our heros individual films you will easily enjoy the ten times more you will be also ten times more excited to see everything played out i also feel like i need to say that i was very very nervous when i heard the was announced in film we like to focus on one character and we like to see that one person change over the course of the movie its hard to keep track of multiple characters which is why the singlehero format works so well otherwise we end up with meathead city like the expendables gross luckily we have the insteadso our unlikely heroes team up together to defeat thors brother loki luckily all of these overpowered world savers are used to having each other as company psychnotreally they all have pretty big egos lets be honest but we dont see just how big their egos are until they all share one movie together jump ahead they have to learn how to cope with one another and just barely tolerate each other in order to stop the worlddestroying threatthere is some absolutely wonderful cinematography put together by seamus mcgarvey did i mention how clever the script is joss whedon poured his fricking essence into the pages of writing and it pays off so very nicely i dont feel like the was missing anything that ticked me off i also have never been so excited for a sequel before in my life my only hope is that disney can buy out spiderman from fox and we can get some spiderman action in there but i digressthe flat out rocked my socks off 910,fantasy
its one of the few movies that worths a ten star  a perfect 10 or an a i can feel the actors feeling and interaction very well realized and a flawless subject simply splendid  things are getting very well with the hollywood movies with this part the action part like battleship wrath of the titans clash of the titans etc some things which i dont agree is the soap movies and the blondes yes the blondes i hate blondes they should be natural blond at least the horror movies sux too much violence and child implication anyways i adore this movie and i can watch it over and over again thats what they say that a good movie you watch it over and over again,fantasy
ive always watched marvel films but ive never been the greatest fan of them i find them entertaining but they are often similar and rarely deliver quite such the memorable and actionpacked experience that assemble offers seriously whether you are a marvel fan or not give this film a chance it may very well surprise youi cant think of any particularly large faults to this movie that are worth mentioning the plot isnt exactly unique but thats not what i saw as the purpose of the film the films plot tied together the previous marvel films featuring heroes such as iron man and captain america very well it then went on to set up and deliver a roller coaster ride of scifi action unlike anything ive ever seen before in a marvel film assemble certainly beats the previous films in terms of cgi action characters and memorability from the opinions of friends i know that the film has even appealed to those that arent directly a fan of scifi action there is certainly something about the film that simply stuns the viewer and impresses them with uptodate visuals and a fastpaced storyline a fact worth mentioning is that unlike previous films assemble doesnt take itself too seriously its not a comedy or a parody but it does allow for humorous moments that actually made me smile more than some actual comedies have this allows you to enjoy the film further i feel rather than taking away the more serious elementsif you havent seen the film already make sure to find the time to watch it it will entertain you in some way or another and is definitely worth at least one viewing truly one of the better movies of the past decade,fantasy
the was a fantastic movie yes its been out for a while and i saw it a while ago but if you have not yet seen it i definitely recommend that you do the movies dialogue was fantastic and often hilarious in a good way the special effects were also great and fit the film well personally though what i loved most about the film was seeing the learn to work together as a team in the beginning there was fighting between them as different people they wanted to do things differently near the end when the big battle ensues you really see them start to care for each other that care also translates to you as you will also start to care for these characters as the film goes along i loved the movie and i think its very much worth a watch if you have not already,fantasy
this is what we have been waiting for the culmination of years of planning years of filming and years of crosspollination of characters throughout the marvel movie universe the bar was set unbelievably high and i did my best to temper my expectations as i walked into the theater along with the millions upon millions of moviegoers this opening weekend when the lights dropped i mentally wiped the slate clean and hoped beyond hope that it was good at least better than iron man 2 as so many other people have said by now i was more than pleasedthe follows the beginning of one of marvel comics most powerful supergroups as the world finds itself woefully unprepared for an alien onslaught led by the scorned demigod loki while the various heroes dont play nicely together at first they come together when the time comes and prove they are much more powerful together than apart together they are unstoppablemany of the reviews have been focusing on mark ruffalo and his charismatic portrayal of bruce banner aka the hulk originally much of the focus was on him because he is now the third actor in as many films to play the legendary green behemoth yet after the release the buzz stayed on him because he brought something to hulk that was sorely lacking before humanity arguably ruffalo wasnt on screen a ton and its hard to say whether we have been so amazed with his performance if it was ninety minutes or more but since marvel and company immediately signed him to a sixpicture deal to continue being big green and angry we will all get our chance to test the theory out ive always loved ruffalo as an actor and i have all the faith in the world he can make this rage monster a dynamic character to watch but the real gamble will come in the script weve seen full movies with eric bana and edward norton already so this next one or two or three need to bring something different not just a rehash of those before luckily the phenomenon also allows the next hulk picture to skip over the origin story since its fairly unnecessary nowwhile ruffalo can rightly bask in the glow of a job exceedingly well done the rest of the cast deserves praise as well everyone up and down the line brought their agame and they played off each other incredibly well robert downey jr can sometimes overshadow people on screen just due to his charisma but he did exactly what he said his character of tony stark aka iron man couldnt doplay nicely with others however the pressure was really more on jeremy renner as hawkeye and scarlett johansson as black widow since they were only side jobs in some of the previous marvel chapters each did a great job with extra credit given to johannson and possibly her fight double if she had one for her intro sequence with the russian mobstersi cant close this review out without bringing up one of the reallife superheros of the story writerdirector joss whedon the man is a living legend in the geek community and this film proves the accolades and unending praise are wellfounded he achieved a perfect balance of action pace and story all while managing to encompass the overabundance of characters jokes were welltimed and welldelivered and he allowed for possibly risky moments to go all out resulting in one of the most hilarious and enjoyable scenes in marvel movie history youll know it when you see itsure there are some nitpicky moments that you can dig up if youre so inclined feel free to send me what you think those might be and ill gladly drop in some of mine yet in the end the experience is what counts and i couldnt wipe the smile off my face as i left and not just because the final extra scene at the end of the final credits was pure genius this movie captured absolutely every bit of the tone and energy of a comic book summer blockbuster and if whedon was a professor this would be his master class,fantasy
ill make it simplebest points action scenes scarlett johansson iron man hulklow points captain americai went to see this movie in 2d because i dont like the 3d but after awhile i was regretting it because the scenes are awesome and must be really great in 3d even in 2d the heroes and creatures seem to come inside the cinemacaptain america is so wrongly portrayed here its a mix of the old one of the comics in the 60s with the new one of civil war when the best comics of captain america were in the 80s and 90s hes supposed to be a man not a kid hes supposed to have a strong voice not a sweet women lovable voice hes supposed to be a bulk not a normal gym guy hes supposed to have an armor that shows respect and represents dignity not a plastic suit that looks a carnival suit for kids hes supposed to throw his shield like it was easy and light for him and not heavy or with much effort the shield its supposed to be an extension of his arm and not his shoulder hes supposed to be a leader and not someone who tells jokes he never makes anyone laugh hes the moral standards of every group something that no iron man thor hulk or other hero can do as him because apart from his serum and special abilities he represents humanity at his best not a playboy business man or a god or a monster hes representing the best of mankind and human spirit hes more then a soldier and last but not least he never takes a gun and starts shooting apart from thatbecause captain america is one of my heroes i cant give a 9 to this movie all the scenes are great loki isnt that good as everyone says here a god doesnt spit to a glass while talking you dont even know if gods have saliva its not cool but anyway i think it deserves a 95 because i cant give that and although it doesnt respect captain america spirit right its an awesome movie 10 starsbest part of the movie is the scene when hulk starts fighting the bad guys you wont get better excitement and thrill then this not even on the hulk movies what a shame for those two,fantasy
so much build up and it all leads to this and its awesome i know im late in reviewing this and everything has been said in all kinds of praise and this movie deserves it just see it even if you dont like comic book movies see it what i find amusing is that ironman was never really the top billing of the it was always captain america until now robert downey jr steals every scene that his name is first on the credits seriously hes that awesome i was also surprised with mark ruffalos performance as the hulk he was great his scenes with robert downey jr are some of the most memorable i also havent seen the thor flick but the guy who played them was really good and really seemed into character hawkeye was cool and scarlett johanssen is hot okay the plot bad guy named loki wants to take over the world and does a really good general zod impression kneel before me and try to stop him whats funny is that he looks tough in the beginning but then turns into a rag doll at the end just ask the hulk and whatever injustice the previous movies had done to the hulk certainly makes up for it herejust see it its a lot of fun and its what summer movies are supposed to be its a great beginning to summer movies im glad i went,fantasy
most fun ive had in a long long time yes fun although this movie was just about 2 12 hours long it was so entertaining and engrossing for me that it seemed like about 1 12 hours the character development was good and each character was given a bit of screen time to develop the character the action was good and not overpowering it only added to rather than being the main part of the movie the comic level was perfect not too much goofy stuff said just to try and get laughs every line imo was perfectly placed although ill have to see it again in order to hear some funny lines that i missed due to the laughter in the theater by the way morning matine was sold out full each character was in character as we know themcaptain america was still the 40s guy iron man was still well iron man thorperfect the hulk  super good best depiction ive seen etc i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it fulfilled all my likes for a moviegood vs evil and good kicking butt enjoyable fun time and escape good dialog good looking and pg ive seen enough violence and sex and love the break for some simple ol good times,fantasy
it pains me to say that because i was a spiderman fan growing up and spiderman started off this superhero crazed movie run with what was the best movie what made spiderman stand apart was that it was a great movie and a great superhero movie well move over because did most everything right enough to at least have a discussion of whether spiderman 1 or 1 was the better movie it might have helped that i do not know the avenger lore as well as i knew others but everyone else is in agreement i am reluctant about this statement because you hear something is the best ever and then it never lives up i read a lot of hype in these pages before i went and saw it now i have seen it and must agree with the hypeone thing i was afraid of mark ruffalo as the hulk which i am a little still out on but i do like mark ruffalo but made bruce banner a little too weakeffeminate it comes together nicely though another was scarjo yes she is sexy enoughunderstatement but was she athletic enough to carry it out and she did well enough another problem the bravadoegos of the characters not stars but characters of such a movie would demand a lot of screen time for each one to make this work that would be a problem if it was not accomplished the movie was very good on this point cobie robin from how i met your mother was a bit of a distraction for me in a secondary role but did a competent job the most interesting thing for me was that joss whendon was director and writer he created buffy angel fireflydollhouse i wondered how he would do with such mainstream fair and he managed to bring everything together almost perfectly i say almost because there is one bit that is missing it is somewhat minor but who taught bruce banner the secret to control his angry green side that is the only piece missing for mefor those that want specifics effects were top notch acting was excellent story lines were compelling the comedy was perfect 995 of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really welli think you will enjoy this movie unless you only enjoy completely realistic movies,fantasy
im pretty sure i had a grin on my face the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes including the 20 minutes i waited after the film to check that there wasnt a sneak peek after the credits its got a great great story which is relatively true to the comics stan lee must have had a lot of creative input into it really makes a difference shows why his comics have been around for almost 80 yearsconsidering how many big characters there are the character development is fantastic you really buy in to each of their personal agendas and feelings the guy who plays the hulk is just incredible never seen him before i dont think he gives you the impression that he is a loaded gun that can crack at any point fly of the handle and turn into this massive green smashing machine which obviously he does the tension is incredible its got laugh out loud moments liberally scattered throughout that was making the whole cinema laugh most of them coming from either robert downy jr or weirdly enough the hulki have to say i felt really comic book geeky as there was one line that only comic geeks would have got i laughed and about 4 other people behind me laughed ironicially enough we were also the people that stayed until after the creditsthe last act has some of the best action sequences that have ever been put on film period the cgi which there is a lot of didnt feel like cgi you are so engrossed and it is done so well that you forget that it actually is cgiit certainly helps to have a grounding in the marvel films that preceded it but its definitely not necessary i have seen them all so i cant be completely certain but i think youd do ok even if you havent there are some quick flashbacks and some expository dialogue about whats happened in the other films enough to bring you up to a good enough level to get it i think obviously its better if youve seen them though so if you havent yet i highly recommend filling in the gaps i would say that in descending order of usefulness you should see thor captain america the first avenger iron man 2 iron man and the incredible hulk adding to that my girlfriend hasnt seen any of them i thought she would just think it was a geeky film but she loved it i was shocked so much so that well be watching iron man 1 and 2 at her suggestioni read loads of reviews saying that it is not worth watching in 3d i have to say i completely disagree there is a lot more they could have done with the 3d element for example hawkeye with his arrows would be amazing you know firing arrows at your face etc but i prefer the subtle bits of 3d when you do not even realise when it doesnt distract you from the film there are bits at the end of the last act where there are bits of ash just floating about in 3d very subtle very goodthere is a bit after the initial credits so stay for a bit not a lot of people will get the character they show as it is not a familiar villain but it does set up for a sequel which will struggle to top this movieit is very rare that a movie lives up to the hype especially for me but this will be the movie of the year spiderman batman will struggle to replicate the success if they can they will be amazing tooits the best superhero film ever made thats not hyperboleoh also scarlett johanson is in it and she is my favourite,fantasy
the elders say that two is company anything more is just a crowd shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas with an ensemble star cast a fast witty script thrilling action sequences and masterful direction it is the perfect superhero movie one which will charm not only the nerdy fans but also the uninitiatedthe project began over 6 years back when marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first each of them were characterized by action humor and a certain degree of insaneness the movies generated big bucks at the box office but i always felt marvel was holding back something whether the grandness of plot or the scale of action this is what it was saving for no holding back for the 220 million mother of all actioners 6 superheroes one mental norse god a full scale alien invasion this one has got it allthe story picks up plot strands from the previous movies loki steals the tesserect a cube like artifact which is a source of great power which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade earth post credit scenes in the older marvel movies show that nick fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day where the earth will be hilariously out gunned and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team to form an unbeatable squad each superhero gets something to the table hulk brings the muscle captain america brings strategy ironman brings style and technology thor brings emotion along with godlike fury hawkeye brings steely sincerity and black widow brings smokinghot sexiness but before they can take on loki and his minions they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team much of the films uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes the climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last years transformers dark of the moon but is infinitely more enjoyable each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team each sequence bettering the previous one the movies biggest strength is its star cast robert downey as ironman continues from where he left off in ironman 2 billionaire playboy genius philanthropist he calls himself as he lends sarcastic humor to an oh so serious group chris evans as captain america might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity chris hemsworth as thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil while jeremy renner and scarlett johansson as hawkeye and black widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the ateam however the scene stealers were mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk and hiddlestons loki ruffalo is probably the best hulk to grace the silver screen and while edward norton and eric bana played the role with intensity ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor trust me with or without pants the hulk will keep you in splits but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the hulk delivers the coup de grace to loki lokis expression immediately after priceless  speaking of whom the star of the movie is loki a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain think joker in the dark knight or doc ock in spiderman 2 and in hiddleston plays loki in a manner that man to man he stands head and shoulders above the heroes this loki like most super villains has a sinister single point agenda to rule the world and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him in of all places germany notsolongago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world when loki is captured and held in a glass cell he gives a little bit of the hannibal lecter treatment to scarlettyou do a far better job if you love what you do and director joss whedon is a certified geek having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series the biggest input that joss whedon brings is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it hold on he seems to say the solution is just round the corner it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously unlike the dc comic adaptations is a celebrity jamboree of sorts and yet whedon manages to give each star his place each character his due weighs in at 146 minutes but to his credit whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout whenever things begin to sag jokes punchlines and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong to sum up is a superlative effort mixing fantasy science fiction imagination colorfully dressed hemen this is the film marvel fans have been waiting for ages they took their time but they delivered on all counts this is a no holds barred effects driven mass appeal blockbuster par excellence absurdly entertaining these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in asgard for geeks such as me and will sure extend its magic to the non fans there are so many characters yet it never felt too many production values are solid the script engaging with loads and loads of nonstop action there are minor flaws but this is the summer blockbuster of the year geeking out has never been so much fun,fantasy
despite the ridiculous overrating of 82 out of 10 stars on this site at the time of this review there are some pretty good negative reviews on here a number of people seem confused why this film is considered good or even outstanding and they should be confused generally im confused why people are so impressed by this type of film over and over it is simpleminded predictable boiling over with clichs ugly to look at lacking character development and overblown in just about every way it really isnt worth the time for a full review particularly in light of some good ones here already ill just list some flaws that i think most people are not acknowledgingthis film is overly long its 2 hours and 22 minutes a popcorn comic book movie shouldnt make your butt and bladder hurt this muchthe pacing of this film is uneven you expect this type of film to be packed with mindless action but it had a lot of inexplicable lulls i thought the dull section of the film on the floating ship would never end the set up also took way too long and was uninterestingthis movie spends a lot of time on the pop psychology of its heroes as well as the psychology of their group dynamic this becomes dull and tiresome yet for the time spent on it we still get cardboard cutoutswhy is the story fueled by the thor story line the most outlandish and inane of the marvel tales close second for captain america loki is a silly petty villain it is hard to relate to any of these heroes as they all seem inexplicably immortal but the whole norse godspace alien thing with thor and loki perhaps should have been swept under the rug maybe there is some sort of comic book tradition reason for this choicethis movie looks bad it is ugly and fake looking there is way too much cgi that isnt even required by the special effects demands of a scene the action scenes have a numbing effect after a little while and it becomes easy to forget you arent watching a video gamethis film is fueled by clichs of every kind it feels like a used third hand piece of writing there are some good actors in this film and some not so good but they arent given enough space to spread their wings the script is also a heavy yoke these actors must try to preform under the restriction ofi felt nothing watching this film other than mild irritation i dont expect a huge emotional impact watching this type of film thats not why i see this type of movie still i found it strangely empty it is basically as if the filmmakers have put their focus on all the wrong aspects of their craft the film quickly ceases to be fun for me in part because it is so emptyi think it also feels empty because it has a going through the motions type feel to it the plot is one of unsubtle inevitability 2 hours and 22 minutes is a long film but it feels much longer if there are few if any surprises and the basic arc of the plot is so polished that it feels like a one hump roller coaster a blockbuster superhero action film isnt really about subtlety nor should it be but this film lacks any moral gray or tense emotion fueled by uncertainty it replaces any emotion with bald faced sentiment and while it is filled with tiny details and references its themes are mind numbing characters thin even if youve seen all the marvel films and storytelling cluttered but full of unimaginative sequencesthis film is slick it is a formula that is well greased and polished to a blinding shine and it is tough to make a film that is presented in this smooth flashy yet nonstylistic sort of way but this confidence of the filmmakers wears on me it feels like the polish of the film makes it feel more plastic than it needs to and guts any chance of the film having a soul and the immense machine that is this film and this series has become so smooth and over confidant that it really does not feel the need to be interesting in any way like in a way a lot of cheap low budget and unambitious movies are it is a plague of our age of filmmaking remember when a blockbuster used to be something like jaws,fantasy
it may be mildly entertaining but its still just other very long and slow mix of tired battle scenes and some wooden masturbatory borderline cringeworthy dialogue all leading to a predictable ending there were a couple good laughs but that doesnt really make up for the fact that this was over two hours and twenty minutes robert downey jr was the best part because his sarcasm is great its too bad i cant really say much about the rest and keep in mind i genuinely like the iron man movies and captain americahere everyones already established and undefeatable whats the point of having characters that you cant root for and therefore you dont care about the outcome they never hit rock bottom therefore theres no end to the second act therefore the whole film is completely unsatisfying and again its boring two and a half hours leading to an obligatorily happy and sequelwelcoming ending dear lord change it upwhy was the dark knight trilogy good because it had human characters that had legitimate weaknesses therefore carrying on the plot that had the characters grow and if they died we felt sad why because we cared for them why did we feel bad for james bond in casino royale we believed he loved vesper and the third act was made with an emotional punch why did we care for silva in skyfall he was a great villain because he was funny menacing fantastically portrayed by javier bardem and his motives had a believable character background m captivated our interest and it was a welldeveloped terrificallyacted character that had great motherson chemistry with bond the has none of that just pretty cities that go boom slapstick humor and throwaway lines all on repeat the characters interact with each other like annoying small children and the same dialogue constantly put on repeat made me so bored410 bad below average horrifically overrated two thumbs down etc,fantasy
as i missed this in the theatre i waited a long time for the bluray to come out i knew back in 2008 when iron man came out that the were assemblingi did not understand why marvel made a second hulk film after ang lees marvelous work but that hulk was a standalone story and not worked into the fabric of the marvel multiverseeach solo film introduced characters which were to be in this film iron man was the most developed of them all the hulk captain america and thor each developed those characters for this filmthere was one more avenger that should have been included wolverine but at the time marvel did not have the rights even so wolverine was not part of that first comic so long ago where they battle loki and that is what this film was aboutjoss whedon was the prefect director to tackle this his work on his television shows and the movie serenity prepared him for it i was glad that an underdog was given the helm and he succeeded brilliantlyafter being bombarded by the first three xmen films and the sam raimi spidey trilogy it was just time to make this film the are that one marvel property that has threads into all of marvels super heroesthe pivotal piece was samuel l jacksons nick fury  i grew up when nick fury was a white guy and he was a much different character sometime in the late 90s and early 2000s marvel recreated all of their heroes and gave some of them a complete makeover but jackson plays fury much the same way david hasselhoff did in the tv movie it does not matter what colour he is white or black hes the same guyit is this one man who spearheads the initiative  even though his board of supervisors have put the program on ice fury finds a way to make it happen he puts together a response team to deal with the threat of lokiwe met loki in thor  originally he was thors brother and best friend in thor loki learns he is actually a frost giant which is actually part of the norse legend and something snaps in him the loki in the is not the subdued quiet loki we meet in the first few scenes of thor he has completely lost itthis mirrors the way he was written for the comic books the way i see it loki does not really know what he wants so he is just trying as many bad things as he can think up in the case of this film he has made a shaky alliance with some creepo aliens we learn exactly who these guys are at the very end of the film after the title credits as the other is talking to his boss who turns in profile and he is a skrullthe tesseract the cosmic cube which has been a huge part of marvel stories was seen in captain america red skull was abusing it it fell into the arctic ice and howard stark grabbed it after the events of the movie thor fury assigns dr eric selvig stellan skarsgrd to figure out what the futz this thing actually isand they find out as hawkeye jeremy renner states at the beginning of the film the cube is a doorway and it is being opened from the other sidein steps loki and he has gone even more insane comparing the human race to bugs to be squashed via a boot loki manages to turn hawkeye and selvig this is another thing about loki which came from the comics and the entire complex where the cube was being tested caves in huge radar antenna and allfrom this point on its non stop we get to see so much stuff from the comics the shield helicarrier the mansion which was stark tower but the best thing was the interaction of these guys they dont get along in the comics and they dont get along very well at first here what surprised me was how well mark ruffalo made the hulk come to life even though i liked ang lees hulk better but rufallo actually acted the hulk which was something not done in the two hulk moviesfrom this point on sets a bar for marvel movies that will be difficult to reach again let alone surpassthis film easily surpasses the quality of the first two xmen films without burying them,fantasy
the is simply a superb movie in every way that matters forget comparing it to other films of the genre ill save that for a later date because it really isnt important judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment its the best time ive had in theaters in a very long time first off forget what you think you know or expect because it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed there is very little clichd about the film they establish their own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films if youve seen them all youre in for a real treat with if you havent youll enjoy them more now watching them after they fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance character and scene every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish you really are drawn in to the world and to the each and every character right from the first act that connection makes the action more meaningful just like with the best of movies regardless of genre the dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a reason the conflict and tension present between everyone protagonist antagonist friend and foe absolutely makes the film the performances that stem off of that are all remarkable the charisma this film packs and theres plenty of it comes from the flawless performances and the dialog also the supporting cast is utilized perfectly this is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been made bold statement i know i rarely rely on critics but when nine out of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason it makes you wonder what those few others saw or how much they were paid not to like an instant classic,fantasy
i must say out of all the marvel films iv seen including spider man 2 i have to admit this is the best one the action is brilliant the director is a very talented person i was worried that i wouldnt see enough of each character especially hawkeye but i was wrong there was a perfect amount of scene time for each character the jokes were hilarious as well the audience kept on laughing this film is a solid 1010 if you are skeptical about seeing the film you shouldnt be every minute of it was mindblowing i wasnt bored even for a second in my opinion this is better than the hunger games go see this movie when it comes out i promise you,fantasy

the is what we all dream about on reading those superhero comics and watching the movies we always would love the concept of having all superheroes assembled and fighting for justice and that if such a thing happens nothing ever could happen to our planet earth however rational thinking would suggest putting them all in one basket would make movie making quite difficult since the logistics of bringing an all conquering villain along with the bonding of the superheroes would change the dynamic of the superhero movie concept and can be a double edged sword if not handled properly certainly they cannot make a movie where the heroes are summoned to fight evil and they come and finish the job and they leave it has to be more complicated than that for the movie to succeed and it ishats off to the director and writers of this movie since they not only have a villain who is manipulative evil and quite powerful with his own army who can provide quite a challenge to the heroes but also have handled well the tricky scenarios of putting all the heroes in the same room hulk iron man and thor are all used to fighting outside of the law as vigilantes in their own movies these three would normally have no problem working together the bonding between ironman and hulk was depicted aptly since they are both scientists and vigilantes however the presence of captain america black widow and hawkeye who are all used to following orders and work for the law within this mix creates a lot of tension in the air when they start interacting the blame games and oneliners are on and believe me the one liners from rdj are really cracking all this makes for a compelling first halfobviously the second half is all about how they work together to destroy the enemy its predictable but its fun and visually awesome as well visually its a spectacle and must be watched in 3d the movie is not without its cons though for one i really thought with loki as the villain thor should have had a better role to play unfortunately he was severely under utilized scarlett is given an expansive role i should say her body in that tight fighting outfit is awesome she is hot which sometimes even outshines captain america and the restwatch it even if its not awesome or amazing or whatever you will certainly enjoy the ride,fantasy
here is the movie they were preparing us for iron man captain america thor this was where they would eventually go and brother it didnt disappoint joss whedons magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo and more capable direction and a more taut script than most of the socalled superhero movies made the movie featured an interesting mix of marvel heroes coming together as a team when the earth is in crisis to save the world from a spectacular intro where loki arrives unexpectedly at shield hq to the brilliant final showdown is a thrill ride never letting go this is the summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see lots of action lots of thrills superheroes and and a badass villain every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction the one liners are numerous and never seem forced iron mans quips are just as well timed as always enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions joss whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film iron man is the machine with a heart who never shows it the hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it and most surprising of all black widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance all hints of fear love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions scarlett johansson is a casting choice to be applauded as is mark ruffalo since i now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role the only flaw i could think up was the marvel universe as such i dont understand why the xmen werent considered for the program legal rights to the characters issues but the movie is a wonderful viewing experience and by all means a treasure must see for the summer of 2012,fantasy
i just got back from the film on the 27th of april watching its totally worth watching i would not hold back from suggesting anyone to watch itthrough out the whole film there was continuous laughter through out the cinema during the filmit was worth every penny even although it was rather expensive to watch costing 985 for a 3d showing at our local cinema in wigani do really hope this short review not giving anything away will help you to decide to whether you want to watch it or not and if you do i hope you will enjoy it like i did when i went watching italso i would like there to be a second film on this because i think that could be even better,fantasy
this was the movie i have been an avenger ever since i was 16 and was reading my first comic although i was a marvel fan well before that so i have been waiting for this movie for a good 11 years assemble is near enough the perfect movie and marvel have finally done the unthinkable and ousted the dark knight as greatest comic book movie and actually greatest movie of all time joss whedon as director put tingles down my spine as i am a major buffy and angel fan in addition to him writing the greatest x men story of all time astonishing x men i knew we was in excellent handsif there are 2 minor criticms of this movie it would be these 1 maria hill by cobie smulders im a major fan of himym and her character robin schebatsky and miss smulders is a major crush of mine however they made maria hill into your carbon copy standard issue agent if this was going to be the way no need for her to be so heavily featured in the advertising2 the battle cry isnt actually screamed out in the moviedespite these 2 oversights it simply is the greatest movie of all time1010,fantasy
first of make sure to see it in 2d not 3d nice sharp picture in the lovely 2d all thanks to digital at my cineworld this thursday not sure why us brits get this and battleship ahead of youout of the 30 plus films ive seen this year i really enjoyed this that much that might see it again a sheer joy from star to finish and its very very funny too which is good and very much neededim being vague as i dont want to say anything but see this film does not matter if you like super heroes or comics its just plain funthe acting story and script by all is top and a great villain which really carries the film look forward to amazing spiderman now,fantasy
the absolute only reason i would give this movie a rating of three is because the visual effects werent terrible in all honesty i had no intention of ever seeing it but because my father bought it i watched it and winced all the way throughnow ill preface this by saying that im a fan of darker comic adaptations and im certainly not an expert on the in general but in my opinion this was one of the most obnoxious comic adaptations ive ever seen quite a long list of specific grievances here lokis character was laughably dramatic everything was overwhelmingly loud explosions hello the acting with robert downey jr and mark ruffalo being exceptions was subpar at best and the few weak attempts at humor literally had me putting my hands over my face out of embarrassment for the writers i wont even go into the blatant discrepancies between the comics and the film it was just so so bad basically this is one of those movies thats really really horrible but everyone wants to believe its good because of the anticipation buildup and its aimed at the idiots who dont actually care about comics or characters but are stupid enough to act like they know everything about them after they see it im angry with the film industry for this one although sadly it turned out to be exactly what i expected a money maker thats all it is if youre looking for any talent honor or artistic merit you wont find it here folks just a lot of explosions,fantasy
this is a good film but the current overall imdb score of 89 is rather highput simply its entertaining and fun however the problem inherent in the film is how to fit so many larger than life characters into one story and give them equal screen time whedon manages to do it but as a result i feel the story had to fit the characters rather than the characters fit the story there are a lot of new character relationships that have to be established it gets a little bit convoluted trying to keep up with itselfthe threat facing the ie loki and his rather randomly sourced army just seems a bit cobbled together especially the army where they came from or what they are doesnt seem properly explained just that loki somehow has one the threat the face seems more to do with sheer numbers of bad guys rather than any particularly interesting powerful individual villains loki on his own just doesnt seem that threatening he is wonderfully without remorse though bitter and twisted by his quest for revenge one of his scenes with black widow is almost like hannibal lector and clarice in silence of the lambsblack widow for my money is the most entertaining and interesting character in the film maybe its because she doesnt actually have any super powers that makes her so what she does have is an exceptional mind attitude and rather scary hand to hand combat skills played wonderfully by scarlet johannson she is a pleasure in practically every sceneone of the other pleasurable things about this film is the occasionally very funny dialogue and scenes whedon is a master of witty fast paced exchanges and he doesnt disappoint here the cinema audience laughed hard many times the hulk having the two biggest laughs in the filmthis is a decent film which could have went horribly wrong a lot of lead characters vying for screen time is a problem time spent establishing new relationships also perhaps the next one will be more compelling the film isnt overly subtle but then what did i expect given the nature of its premise,fantasy
what an utter disappointment expected so much more substance from joss whedon with so many great characters w great stories youd think the writers could have put together a good story but nothats not what obscenely budgeted films with the sole purpose of setting up a franchise care most about everyones already pointed out all the ridiculous plot problems so ill just say that the writers had no excuse when theres an entire comic series worth of stories to supply all they needed to work things out a waste of some decent actors and lots and lots of money pretty clear that the only moment samuel jackson actually enjoyed was when he got to walk out and blow up one of the jets he looked bored or in pain for every other mediocre line i enjoyed most of the witty onelinersand thats about it shallow on so many levelswho cares how shiny the cg was or how many things got blown up the studio may have raked in disgusting amounts of cash based on the hype and the promise of a great story but will anything else about this film be memorable cant see how stan lee would have been pleased,fantasy
since that final clip with nick fury and tony stark in iron man there was hope that maybe marvel could really be doing an movie 4 years later and 4 movies later iron man 2 hulk thor captain america and we have joss wheddons what makes the so engaging and intriguing is the dialogue between the superheroes joss wheddon should be awarded with an oscar for the writing and directing of the everyone blended in so naturally and their back and fourth banter made for some good comedy everyone felt equal from hawkeye to hulk it is so difficult to balance these personalities on screen and i dont think any other director besides joss wouldve been able to pull it off the way he didthe action scenes in the is as epic as it gets the last hour is like a marathon of awesomeness every action sequence in this movie was perfectly executed and each character had their significant moments the cast was phenomenal as usual but the showstealer is definitely mark ruffalo his portrayal of the incredible hulk was spot on he was wildly entertaining and i couldnt help but cheer him on when he smashed sht i think what made the hulk work was because he was used sparinglyloki as the villain was great i felt he was developed a lot better here than in thor he was witty and had an evil aura about him especially when he was interacting with the mortalsnever have i enjoyed a movie so much as the the 2 hour plus runtime flew by easily and i was left wanting more once it ended once in a while a masterpiece of a film comes along and after the hilarious closing scene after the credits it was clear that this was marvels masterpiece back to the future and terminator 2 have always been my go to favourite movies after this gem i believe i can the to that list 1010,fantasy
ive seen thor captain america and most of the super hero movies have you noticed most of the good ones are about marvel characters most of them are acceptable some not so much some more so this one blows all the other hero movies out of the water its a perfect blend of hero character development and teamworkof course there had to be the usual squabbling between heroes but this one did it so well as soon as this comes out on dvd i intend to own it you dont get to see a movie this good very often anymorethe hulk was done so much better than than any of the movies ive made it a point not to own any hulks this one showed him in all his glory and unpredictability thor was watchable iron man more so captain america rather boring until the last half hour but this one went where they failed,fantasy
when i stood in the long line up nearly out the door to buy my ticket to see the i was hoping to be blown away with the action packed story line the trailers promised i was nothing short of blown away as the movie progressed from the main story lineplot to the underlying story and other messages that the i saw from the story the plot from beginning to end was important all the way through and must not be missed for the viewer to experience all this movie has to offeri hope that any other future movie viewers find this movie just as appealing as i did i highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a n action film that is appropriate for children and can still amuse adults at the same time,fantasy
i went to see this movie opening day with my uncle brother and father i thought i was just going to leave with the expression it was just a movie boy i was wrong i left the theater with the biggest smile on my face the characters the action and the special effects are what made the put a smile on my facei have to say my favorite characters were black widow and hawkeye captain america and thor came in second and the hulk iron man and loki came in lastim not going to spoil it just see the movie itll be worth your time and money1010,fantasy
well to put this incredibly simple it is the movie of 2012 also it is probably the best adventure movie i have seen in a long long time with superb acting intense battle scenes and a surprisingly enjoyable story line and script this movie differs from many others in the movie industry today one of the highlights for me was the incredible acting of robert downey jr chris evans and scarlett johansson to say the least to give you a taste of the funny lines here is a line from captain americas quarrel with iron man captain america you are super with that suit on but take that away and what are you iron man a genius billionaire playboy so as you can see this is an absolutely amazing movie that i recommend everyone to go and see,fantasy
finally joss whedon gets the recognition he deservesafter creating some of the most compelling intelligent and entertaining tv shows of all time  buffy angel firefly dollhouse  he brings the same mastery of writing ensemble casts to the big screen and people see what he is capable ofjust give the guy a blank cheque and let him write all the scifi and fantasy he wantsfar from being immature entertainment his previous masterpieces all respected the intelligence of the audience and contained characters that were so likable and charismatic that it was impossible not to tune in each weekhere he does what he did in buffy angel and firefly but he does it with a massive budget and some of the most famous superheroes in the world who else could have written and directed a film starring iron man thor the hulk and captain america but doing them all justice not only that but also doing justice to nick fury hawkeye and black widow his trademark aptitude for writing strong female protagonists really came through with black widowgo see it  then watch all of buffy angel and firefly,fantasy

the is one of these rare movies where it lives up to all the tons of hype it has gotten it has made over 15 billion dollars and it has received high praise from both fans and critics and the success of this movie is very well deserved the really great thing about this movie doesnt come from all the action humor or visual effects it is to see all these characters interact with each other in one room joss whedon truly was the man for the job and he impresses once again with his ability to portray each character as meaningful as the other everybody counts there isnt one hero but six of them and they are all relevant and meaningful plus all their character development is superb all of them whedon has my full respect the visual effects in this movie are out of this world it really is spectacular and a joy to watch the cinematography is likewise beautiful in this movie but in the technical department all my praise and full respect goes to alan silvestri his score for this movie blew me away especially the assemble tune no gripes from me in the technical departmentas for the cast they are all terrific robert downey jr is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie mark ruffalo makes the best bruce banner aka the hulk to date with a serious and human yet comedic performance chris evans is still quite good as captain america as far as performances go this guy is probably the weakest but hes still an awesome actor chris hemsworth isnt a remarkable actor either but he has nice charisma and fits the role as thor scarlett johansson is smoking hot and sexy and much more relevant than she was in iron man 2 jeremy renner was just pure badass agent clint barton aka hawkeye samuel l jackson was epic and badass in the role of nick fury tom hiddleston isnt exactly a really strong or serious villain mostly he just feels like a comic relief but hiddleston can act and hes got a few agonizing scenes stellan skarsgrd and cobie smulders is also good in their supporting rolesive chosen to judge this movie with what it is a fantastic superheromovie and for that it has to get a 10 for me we couldnt have hoped for a better movie im already looking forward to 21010,fantasy
i went into this movie with high expectations being a comic junkie and was not let down although it has some major plot holes  thors arrival hulk finding his way to the battle selvick building a safety in the portal etc and not the most original plot it still manages to completely satisfy me when i go into a movie i use six main things for rating a movie 1is it engaging from the start 2 are the characters interesting 3 is the acting good 4 are the effects quality 5 is the plot good 6 how much would i want to watch it againthe constant action through the film manages to keep you entertained and the good actors and special effects make this movie easy to watch throughout the movie there is this sense that no major character will die and it brilliantly replaces the feeling that they will all live happily ever after with a fun sense of comedy and a spring in its step this movie is by no means perfect but it effectively manages to keep you on your toes and makes you want to watch it again and again i may have some bias based on my love of superheroes but i definitely recommend this movie,fantasy
i am a big fan of science fiction i have not been such a big fan of all movies based on comic books i am not such a big fan of sequels either the was a mustseefilm for me for several reasons but most of all i enjoyed both iron men captain america and a bit of thor as well hulk did not do the trick to methe brings all these superheroes together their opponent is thors evil halfbrother loki his main goal is to get a magical stone or cube that would open the gateway to another dimension to asgard where other even more evil forces await to be released and freed to the world of the humansthe action in the film along with the sfx is great however the storyline is not something you have not seen or heard before actually there is very little new to the film also the decision to get all the superheroes or stars together does not really differ much from expendables which is somewhat huge phenomenon even though the script could be written by a 12yearoldthe is a lot better than expendables but that does not mean it is a whole lot better and that it would be better than lets say iron man for me iron man alone stands above the the film does not come better with bigger explosions and a lot more heroes than in the original film but obviously with fans of the 80s stars in expendables it is enough to bring them all on the screen at oncewhat i truly enjoyed in this film was actually a few parts of the action the one with thor dropping out from the sky or the parts in the end with the heroes pretty much destroying most of the citysiteall in all it is certainly amustsee for the fans of comic stars science fiction and action i enjoyed but not that much that i would recommend it to everybody,fantasy
i cant really say anything that anyone else hasnt said about this film go out and watch it and youll love it best film of the year so far thats all i really have to say about this movie basic details to mention would be that the cgi is pretty good but can still stick out a bit easily another thing to mention is that it can be a little long for people under the age of 13 also i dont care how old your kid is or how much they would want to see this film do not take them to it or rent it when its released on dvd and bluray until theyre thirteen ive seen enough people take them to this movie ignoring the ratings and then getting pssd off that their child is only 8 12 years old,fantasy
one simple word amazing everything from past marvel movies since iron man have led up to this great crossover movie with great heroes such as iron man thor captain america hulk and others the story is epic suspenseful and fun the action sequences are thrilling and well done with great cg integrated with live action the characters are great abound with great acting from great actors like robert downey chris evans scarlett johanson and samuel jackson what else can you expect from great writerdirector joss whedon creator of buffy and angel even if you are not a fan of comic books go see this movie as a excellent way to kick off summer vacation 10 out of 10 stars,fantasy
amazing i am completely and utterly obsessed with this film1 it is brilliant i feel the ratio of humouraction is perfect i love that it has a good number of jokes because i cant normally stand too much action action action i need that humour to break it down a bit this is it of course it also has the eye candy a gal needs  well for me anyhow  loki hes just perfection in every single way tom hiddleston is my favourite british actor since i discovered him in thor i have been hooked and checking out all his other movies he was fantastic as loki i sure hope hes in the sequelive watched this film 4 times in my local cinema for me it never gets boring cant wait for it to come out on dvd because i will definitely buy it i just love everything about this film,fantasy
its finally here oh my god as a big comic fan its amazing to see how far the genre has come in the last decade we finally get star studded spinoff featuring a large cast of some of the greatest characters if youve been living under a rock then you may not have noticed that over the last five years marvel have been churning out their big hitters and building up to the iron man thor captain america and hulk join forces to stop thors brother loki and his alien army sure the plot is simple but thats what we want for a big smackdown for any team we need a great leader and marvel have found the best in joss whedon with his familiarity with large ensembles he effortlessly gives every hero their due he also manages to flesh out characters in very short scenes we get a sense of stark and potts relationship some back story for black widow and hawkeye the confusion of rogers and so forth he does his best work with hulk ive loved every incarnation of the hulk so far so i was wary of ruffalos performance he captures it perfectly going for a more nervous and geeky banner when the hulk is unleashed whedon makes sure to not take it too seriously hulk gets the biggest laughs in this surprisingly comic film the action is fantastic with a number of exciting set pieces the final battle has so many wonderful character moments immersed in the action and they really do work as a team there are a couple of shortcomings the alien race is just pathetic and never really feels like a threat add to that the whole mother ship destroyed and every alien dies plot convenience the film lacks any real threat we hear about the many people loki kills but we never see anything that relates to this without seeing the sacrifices made its hard to get too involved there are also a few moments where characters just happen to show up these are things that are minor nitpicks after all the only way to do a perfect movie would be to have an unlimited budget and unlimited running time what it does achieve is simply amazing and very exciting for the future of superhero films,fantasy
i was sceptical going into the theatrehowever after two plus hours of crash bang  wallop i thought i got my moneys worth and then somethe main protagonists all deliver topnotch performancesand the flick is filled with great comic momentsfor me the standout performance in the movie was delivered by the hulkthe special effects  3d were spoton and the full repertoire of the hulks destructive power were encapsulated in some great action sequences the battle with thor throwing loki around like a ragdoll and the onepunch of the alien being notable highlights of the filmmy only criticism would be of the onedimensional aliensi think weve already seen enough giant bugs in plenty a movieit is not on a par with a chris nolan batman movie nor was it as intelligently crafted as the watchmen moviealso the storyline was fairly predictable from the offsetthe only recent comic ensemble that can challenge this movie imo was the latest xmen prequelwell done joss whedon and the rest of the team i hope he can improve on this initial movie with an even better sequel in a nutshellthe assemble delivers crash bang and wallop in huge extremely satisfying doses,fantasy
i really enjoy some comic book movies  spiderman 2 and the first xmen are excellent in my opinion but im completely baffled by the high ratings given the the dialog is stupid most of the costumes really lame the story line completely predictable and good lord but the clichs run rampant the supervillain has a british accent  thats about all you need to know about this movie most of the acting was completely forgettable or in the case of samuel l jackson just plain godawful if it werent for robert downey and mark ruffalo i dont know how i could give this more than one star as i was suffering through this awful thing my mind kept drifting to mystery men and how much better and funnier it is,fantasy
i probably sound like an grumpy twit with a title like this but im the sort that enjoys most if not all cinema i was a little bit surprised that i didnt enjoy this in fact i thought it was pretty pooryes the action was cool but after tolerating an hour of poor script an hour or so of flatout action wasnt going to cut it for me i ended up sat there waiting for new york to be destroyed enough that i could leave the cinemaone of the main issues is that dialogue tries too hard to be witty and falls flat then the serious conversations are just too melodramatic and overtly clich i was sat cringing whenever thor or loki were talkingpossibly the only part of the movie i genuinely enjoyed was to finally see the ohso crap antagonist be slung back and forth in to the floor by hulk mainly just so i didnt have to watch him open his mouthwhilst subjectively i think this movie is crap the action is some of the best hollywood is capable of churning out though its annoying that this film will probably take an undeserved place on the imdb top 250 over this its a poor unoriginal movie caked in explosions pretty cgi and whatnot thus this means that everyone will automatically love itwhats worse is the sequel sneakpeak midpoint in the credits for me it just translated to hollywood wants more of your money to waste on  like this,fantasy
the 2012  12 out of 4 nick fury brings together iron man the incredible hulk captain america hawkeye and black widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation ill be honest and admit that comic book movies arent my 1 type of film and it wasnt until just a month before the opened that i bothered to check out the casts supporting movies i enjoyed the two iron man movies thought thor was very good the incredible hulk was entertaining and i found captain america to be decent but no matter what i felt about those films it couldnt prepare me for how much i enjoyed this one director joss whedon has created something incredibly special and you really cant help but think hes raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it when bringing all of these characters together the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasnt the case here as whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it the constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another this banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great oneliners as well as some terrific action when it comes to these type of movies i usually complain about a couple things one is the obvious cgi but that wasnt a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it another thing i usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times the clocks in at 142minutes which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does in fact the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems say what you will about comic adaptations but theres no question that the is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life this here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up,fantasy
ok im going to have to start with the negatives about this film oh wait there isnt any in all seriousness this film was incredible i went to the cinema and watched it in 3d i already knew that the film was going to be good by reading reviews and going on what my friends said it was like a large group of us went to watch it and came out wanting to watch it again there isnt a single scene in it that is boring or that drags the acting is top class you think that watching a film with lots of superheroes is going to be cheesy or poor in acting performance not with this film the cheesiest thing about assemble was captain americas suit and to be honest thats not even cheesy the graphics were outstanding which is what you hope for when you realize the film cost 220 million to make every time you saw the hulk smashing things up was incredible and not to mention the incredible scene where you see the aircraft carrier actually turn into and aircraft overall assemble is an amazing watch one of the films that youll want to watch again and that you could say in the future i watched that film when it came out in the cinema if you havent seen it already get to your nearest cinema and be as amazed as i was if someone says the film wasnt very good i think its safe to say the have clearly no idea what there talking about 10 stars absolute masterpiece cant wait for a possible sequel watch the credits guys worth it,fantasy
i really liked previous marvel cinematic universe movies and my favorite is captain america because i think it was a different movie and i really liked the tone of it  iron man and thor were really good movies and iron man 2 and the incredible hulk were just ok to me so now we have the  marvel chose joss whedon to direct the movie  and one of the things i like about joss is that he is an incredible talent writer and he is a comic book nerd and writes comics the is by far the best comic book movie of all time i really liked the dark knight and spider man 2 but this one is better actors  what a castrobert downey jr reprises his role as the genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist  tom hiddleston as loki  chris evans as the living legend captain america  chris hemmsworth as thor  the lovely scarlett johansson as black widow  jeremy renner as hawkeye and mark ruffalo as the incredible hulk action lots of action scenes in this movie and lots of humorspoilersfavorite scenes the final battle  hulk smashing loki  and thor vs iron manwhat i didnt like agent coulson death i really liked that guywatch this movie and stay for credits scene you wont be disappointed,fantasy
marvel studios took a leap of faith in handing this project to the brilliant joss whedon after all his only other film that got a cinema release serenity failed to even recoup its budget at the box office they must have seen something in him though because this film is in every sense of the word epicit could so easily have just been iron man and his sidekicks but whedons fine grasp of characters gives everyone involved their fair share of screen time without the film dragging for a second tony stark  iron man robert downey jr is all cocksure and swagger thor chris hemsworth is every inch the demigod that has earth under his protection steve rogers  captain america chris evans is a man so far out of his own time he feels alien to the world he now lives in most enigmatic of the group is natasha romanoff  black widow scarlett johansen who is a master manipulator and reveals only as much as she wants you to know and cliff barton  hawkeye jeremy renner who is both mentor and partner to her their history is one that needs its own filmthe real joy of the piece though is mark ruffalo as bruce banner  the hulk banner lives an isolated life barely keeping the other guy in check when nick fury sends black widow to recruit him in a nice twist it is banner who is needed not hulk ruffalo is by far and with all due respect to eric bana and ed norton the best banner and hulk to date and is given 2 of the films most memorable momentstom middleston chews up the scenery as loki every bit as evil as thor is good with a plan for each of the in turnsamuel l jackson is given more to do as nick fury than ever before he is the master control of the initiative so confident in each of his heroes he is willing to defy orders from his superiorsvisually stunning with great character developments awesome special effects and a breathtaking pace you never feel the 2 hr 10 minute running time popcorn will be left behind as you laugh and cheer through this ridewith the obligatory stan lee cameo although he is not the best cameo in the film and joss whedons trademark suckerpunch both in place assemble as it is known in the uk is by far the best superhero film to date and the sequel will someone please put joss whedon on retainer now,fantasy
not very good loosely based on the comic character development is poorly done all these characters just meet and then get to know so much about each other in so short amount of time external information about the bad guy is learned to quickly how can you tell his habits if he has only just been introduced to you a few hours ago i was really looking forward to this movie heard so many good things but it was a total bust anddd the amount of info known about the hulk before they even meet is a lot like the security guard when he falls down this is prefect for a comic but bad movie adaptation more time would be needed for the development and information to make sense accordingly,fantasy
shakespearean lightning and thunder arrows red white and blue shields and golden armor emerald rage and badass morpheus longcoat and scarlett johanssons leather pearbottom oh how sweet thou fury the god loki tom hiddleston britleering and still looking like data from star trek generations has come to earth from asgard to conquer and destroy and earths mightiest heroes are there to punch him a lotseems kinda ineffectual and unimaginative that against literal magicaldivine foes the best retaliation that can be mustered by the writers of this megasuperhero tale zak penn and joss whedon is that the heroes punch demons flying around on bad motor scooters even the grand resolution though a jawdropping sequence is nothing more than the old destroythesourcetodestroytheminions gambit and what does loki want with earth anyway as we saw in thor 2011 asgard was a pretty bodacious lsdcolorized dazzlegarden is he here for the fabulous grilled prime cte de boeuf at spago is loki after our arab oil our blood diamonds our white women taking his cues from dick cheney his plan seems to be conquest for the sake of conquest no exit strategy no goal and hes using a cuttingedge science concept to do it the tesseract or hypercube theory a wormhole joining two distant points in spacetime loki allies with a croaky guy named the other whose helmet looks like it was fashioned from dog turds and they order their demonriders to spurt through the wormhole to earth and break things some plan dim plot aside the is overseen by marvel the studio that can do little wrong when pumping out alist superhero blockbusters and fashioned by writerdirector joss whedon the man from firefly who can also do little wrong with his iconoclastic approach highly enjoyable movie experience ensuesnot only are there big stupid cgi things and pretty orange explosions aplenty there is heart and poignancy and humor uncertain alliances between heroes petty arguments snappy dialog human frailty and godlike wrath and scarlet johanssons leather pearbottomwhedon does it again  imbues this ostensibly kickapoo punchemup movie with real personality even if you did not meet the individual heroes in their own films over the past few years they are each presented as a throbbing personality crisis no emotion spared except maybe for captain america chris evans whose wooden delivery makes us suspect he landed this job on the cerulean dreaminess of his eyes you see hes frozen his facial muscles in place for fear that if he moves them one iota hell stop looking superpretty and jesus  look at the size of his biceps and then we see chris hemsworths biceps  and theyre even bigger hemsworth once again brings the hammer as thunder god thor on mad steroids halfbrother to loki and therefore forced to speak in a british accent for an aussie thats an eternal annoyancerobert downey jr is tony starkiron man now plonking his ginger assistant pepper gwyneth paltrow cameo and bequeathed the best dialog so cheeky arrogant and sarcastic that brad pitt called from oceans eleven and wanted his insouciance back his armor is the damned coolest thing about this movie and when he is flying up into the wormhole firing his handblasters at demons his power is aweinspiring now if only he had an iron pearbottombruce bannerhulk is dorkcool mark ruffalo love that guy perfectly cast as the most unruffled guy in the room unruffaloed even though harboring the most internal rage in this third major movie featuring the hulk after hulk and the incredible hulk he can apparently change green at will thats my secret  im always angry hey i must be a hulk banner and stark exchange much tech jargon that means absolutely nothing but their quiet moments are powerful matter of fact all the heroes have their portion of quiet time which director whedon effortlessly makes compelling and their dissent is the most interesting element of the movie marvel comics were always canny at setting up marvel teamups where the moral ambiguity of the situation set heroes at odds with one another  and whedon somehow captured that lightningdown the list we have archer hawkeye jeremy renner who can apparently claim superhero status because he has good aim and his arrows explode i guess rambo can fill out that application form then hawkeye and thighjitsu expert black widow scarlett johansson have been rerendered by this movie franchise as two cia assassins with a spanky sexual tension one would think these two mere humans would get lost amidst the super soldiers iron men and gods but again whedon gives us even their little patticake moments and doesnt lose our interest and did i mention scarlett johanssons leather pearbottomsamuel l jacksons role as nick fury director of shield some kind of unnecessary homeland security contrivance has been elevated from that of annoying eyepatch cameo during the stinger of marvel movies to annoying eyepatch starring role wearing his custom leather flying around in his invisible aircraft carrier and constantly whining that earth cant handle these threats so we have to assemble a team that can may i suggest angies list clark gregg appears for the umpteenth time as shield agent coulson now with a first name phil and a predilection for captain america trading cards like the rest of us hemen going bi for caps bicepscobie smulders is here as eye candy i guess one leather pearbottom just wasnt enoughin the final telling the will thrill with its stunning action thoughtful characterization and the simple fact that marvel managed to cram all these colorful icons onto one bombastic piece of celluloid and did i mention scarlett johanssons leather pearbottompoffy the cucumber,fantasy
of all the recent marvel movies which led to this film i thought thor was pretty decent and the rest were blah is arguably the worst yetthe film reminded me of transformers 3 with constant explosions and destroyed buildings as well as ubiquitous 3d scenes which actually dont look very realistic this movie is a gimmickthe plot is utterly clich and haphazard the dialogue save for a few funny lines is very bad no great acting except for loki and he seems out of place among wooden performances even the editing was pretty lazy this movie seems more like a tv serial with forced dialogthe entire film is basically just a vehicle to watch the different heroes fighting with each other,fantasy
i have liked the comics from an early age but it wasnt until i was 10 or 11 years old when i started to systematically collect them following specific titles and plunging myself into the respective mythologies from marvel and dc i have never been never been an exclusive fan of some publisher one of the first comics i took seriously was the because stan lee already knew that the secret to capture the readers wasnt on the cosmic battles and colorful disguises but on the examination of the vulnerable and human side of the characters the was the perfect medium for that because it put together a group of superheroes with very different ideologies and personalities so that their mere interaction was as entertaining as their fights against villains and other threatens fortunately director and screenwriter joss whedon comprehended that fact and as a result the film the is very entertainingin the whedon wrote a generally well balanced screenplay in which he reintroduced the characters justified their alliance and put them to fight as a team in one of those cosmic threatens suffered by new york with such a frequency i said generally well balanced because the screenplay makes some stumbles and has a few weakly developed characters to start with loki feels like a bland villain his methods and his motivation arent consistent to what we had seen in the comics in which he was a formidable and malicious manipulator after all hes the archetypal trickster i also found the helicarrier sequence in which iron man and captain america try to repair an engine during 15 minutes a bit weakit feels like a poor excuse to insert an apparatus action sequence and the other problem from the screenplay is that we dont know practically anything about the character clint barton fortunately it was interpreted by jeremy renner who is such a good actor that he can display his characters nature and his relationship with the other members of the team with just one expression but even like that i would have preferred the sacrifice of some gratuitous action scene in order to bring that character more dimensionthose fails are mainly noticed during the first half of the in which the pieces of the story are being accommodated for the rest this is a very satisfactory and entertaining and unexpectedly quite funny culmination of the cinematic universe marvel had been building since the film iron man in 2008 and it was very pleasant to finally see the seeds which had been planted in that film harvested as for the actors i dont have any complaints when i wrote the review of captain america the first avenger i complained about the fact that chris evans hadnt been able to evoke the gravity of captain america but fortunately he corrected that weakness in the chris hemsworth also brings a perfect work as thor robert downey jr shows a lot of enthusiasm and conviction as tony starkiron man while scarlett johansson as natasha romanoffblack widow and mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk also bring solid performancesin my opinion the best moments from the were the dramatic ones as well as the interaction between the superheroes however that doesnt avoid the action scenes from being exciting their best attribute is that they are always perfectly clear in conclusion even though i wouldnt consider it an excellent film i had a very good time while watching the and that is already more than enough to make it worthy of a recommendation,fantasy
i wasnt intending to write a review about the because i consider it to be one of those movies with a life spawn equal to its running timeafter the credits roll its out of sightout of mind for mebut seeing the praise this mediocre movie gets in most reviews and how it has managed to hit top 50 with an average of 87 i felt the need to even up the balance a littlefirst of all i want to say it is ok to enjoylikelove any moviebut before claiming it to be the best thing ever take a moment to think if enjoyment and quality actually overlapi can guess why the is so popularit has a cast of wellknownloved actors its a comic book adaptationits path has been paved by 4 prequelswithout the hulk movies it features a team of 6 superheroes so everyone can take his pickits a lighthearted movieits an actionoriented movie with flamboyant special effectsits targeted at the most impressionable audiencechildren and teenagershaving all these ingredients the movie only had to play safe in order to be a box office successi must congratulate the producers for perfectly anticipating and manipulating the publics expectationsbecause people are indeed claiming the to be the pinnacle of super hero moviesseriouslypeople as much as i dislike batman i still consider the dark knight to be way more deserving of this titlehowever there seems to be an overall consensus that the had brilliantamazinglike never seen before action and humori must ask youhave you had your memory deleted when you entered the cinemaits true that the movie doesnt screw up in a blatant way and has an enjoyment factor due to the reasons ive enumerated earlier but it consists undoubtedly of the same old clichs which are endlessly used and reused in superheroaction moviesthe bad guy threatens earthheroes are gathered to defeat himthey dont get alongthe bad guy gives them a little beatingnow they get alongthe bad guy is defeated by the heroesand guess where the final fight takes placemanhattan islandand guess what the government does without knowing the outcome of the battletries to nuke the islandbut lets forget the plotaction movies almost never bother with itlets talk about the battleschoreography and imagination were almost absentat times it felt like watching a turn based fighting gameand when that huge metal worm made its entrance i really thought they will fight it together using some cool combos but nohulk simply punched it in the faceand there was an interval of several minutes during which loki was absent from the final battlebut he was probably busy commanding his armytoo bad his troops were randomly flying arounduncoordinated and without using any tacticsmaybe some bgms wouldve helped the battle scenes a little but the ost war rather shy not much is to be said about the characterseach have one or two defining traitsexcepting loki maybe and thats pretty much itthe dialogue is shallowconsisting of cheesy one liners and typical lame jokesmaybe this movie has your favorite superhero maybe youre a big fan of the comics maybe you ship captain america and iron man or you have fantasies with loki maybe you liked the 3d but think before rating this movie a 9 or a 10,fantasy
this was a terrible film the lines were cheesy the action sequences were predictable every sequence that rolled out on screen had already been done to death by countless action films before there was nothing new fresh catching or anything innovative for that matter in the way the film was shot scripted and acted just when i thought things couldnt get any worse the low brow tasteless racist slanderer of captain america yes i know he was doing it to show this mindset was still of that of a white american of the 1940s towards samuel jacksons character made me want to walk out of the film and im not even black a complete waste of money on my behalf to see this film receive the high acclamation that it has just goes to show how brainwashed the general population has become due to the continuous release and production of these utterly mindnumbing idiotic filmsnot even worth a star,fantasy
luckily i saw this movie before i saw the rating on imdb or any other rating or review as a matter of fact actually we were not planning to see this movie but it was the best choice out of other average titleshonestly i would give this movie a 65 on a scale of 10 the action is solid but the story is not nothing to write home aboutbasically it is your bad guy steals superweapon superheros come together to fight bad guy and with some ups and downs there is the expected grand finale with lots of action storythe big problem is that there are a lot of characters in there so not everyone gets enough screen time personally i would have liked that scarlett johanssons character would have gotten more storythe rating at imdb is thus inflated and should not be taken seriously it is not though that i didnt enjoy the movie but for example the dark knight is much better than this,fantasy
my fianc and i have seen this awesome flick twice i am also putting it on my holiday wish list this year so that i can add it to my dvd collection that is how geeked out i am for this movie the cast was memorable robert downey junior was born to play tony stark mark ruffalo excelled as bruce banner and even resembled the comic book banner scarlet johansen and chris hemsworth made for tasty eye candy as black widow and thor respectively samuel l jackson wows as nick fury the story was well told by writerdirector joss whedon there is plenty of humor and action there is also some tragedy as well in the form of the death of sheild agent phil coulsonplayed excellently by clark gregg at the hands of the villain loki played chillingly by tom hiddleston if you have not yet seen this movie run to your local movie theater and see it if you have seen it already see it again,fantasy
when i first read about the film i thought it would not be that good to watch a juice of so many characters but the director was rightfully applauded for his work in giving a good deal of time to all the characters everything about the movie is very nice it takes you through all the characters about whom you would have probably learned a lot and for those who do not know a lot marvel has already done everything for them to understand with a series of films based on the individual character that is a thing that truly marks american films different from others they know what audience will want and how to serve them you will find a lot of instances as i had experienced when you would just be scared that such a nice film has to come to an end after 2 hours 20 minutespros  i loved the timings of each and every characters except for hulk who was introduced in a simple manner but who ultimately steals the show based on his my favorite two dialogs which i have heard from everyone that they liked the instance when hulk comes into action  everyone have to shout like hell iam a big fan of iron man and especially because of robert downey but this green character fills up the whole space every time he becomes angry or rather say wants to be angry what i first thought before entering into this mind blowing film  i had been thinking that thor would be playing a greater role and since he is some god typo so he will help the the most but i like to get wrong evreytime i start a film than comes our nick fury who though was the leader of the group in papers but appeared to be playing a role of the grand daddy i felt this especially in the 2nd half but that was nicely handled as he was doing whatever he could do  and what was best for him black widow and i mean everyone was playing a role that they could play according to their abilities however a single disappointment was the role of captain america who did not seem to fit properly into the fight sequences and he was looking a kind of supporting role along side the hawk eye and the black widowcons  i would have liked to see some more development into the story of the tysserect and how loki got involved with everything everyone seemed to be in a little bit of hurry in the second half well may be i am too attached to the film thats why i am saying that a must watch for anyone,fantasy
if theres a genre thats evolving and becoming better and better in the last decade its the adventurecomic genre not solely a result of better cgi and cinematographic techniques but there is also much better writing and acting and in previous years efforts by nolan and joe johnston have been bypassed by critic and association entities because they are not a specific type of picture it is certainly my hope this brilliant film doesnt suffer the same fate for its great cinema all the waywith a superb cast that appears to embody each of the super heroes and most intriguingly their own stunts we are treated to a very exciting two hours plus at the movies where the earth is once again in danger of being overcome by an alien race and somehow story lines from several films are tied together neatly eventually they all become a cohesive whole and the results are marvelous the film is terrific and it might not reach the levels of perfection that we saw in the dark knight a movie so magnificent in its structure and sustained by terrific writing and acting theres certainly no villain like the joker here but the evil forces are sufficient enough to warrant a cry for help so that we need our heroes to come and kick some alien butt its definitely a showcase for all involved renner downey much warmer than in any of his previous turns as ironman johanssen is magnificent evans is fantastic hemsworth is royal like in his turn but the best turn out there is sheer force of nature that ruffalo gives to the hulk he certainly walks away with the picture yet everyone else gives him plenty of competition for the spotlightthe film is a crowd pleaser with plenty of terrific set pieces leading to an extraordinary third act a piece of cinematic action rarely seen before where every element moves so smoothly it can make your heart soar when you see what really good films can achieve it certainly doesnt remind me of some of the films that have been recognized in the last decade as the best that cinema can offer good film do not have to be serious they have to be well made regardless of what the subject matter is and the once have proved just how amazing solid script writing by one person not a whole team of creative ideas can give you when you combine with top of the line special effects its truly a joy to see jackson sharp tuning a role we have seen before but its now full of pizazzthere are some terrific possibilities coming our way later this year and i am looking forward to the amazing offerings by nolan scott and sonnenfield but they have a battle uphill trying to match this wonderful movie watch learn and learn to give credit where credit is due this is cinema at its best,fantasy
congratulations this is the most boring movie i ever seen in my whole lifei require for a refund i waste 3 hours and 25 for this awful movie next time please turn off the music so i could sleep as well i waste my time at this movie at the first time i get up at the middle of the movie and leave the cinema ive really tried to sleep but the should was too loud and the movie has no really a plotthe basic plot is simple alien come to americaas usual he trying to destroy the worldwow surprising the army is faili think ive already say usual and they save the world by the power of friendship boringso if thats so simple why does its take 3 hoursi really cant believe i said it but i require for a refund,fantasy
the is a great movie and i think its because of what they wanted to do with this film in phase one of marvels cinematic universe and this movie pays off quicklythe action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just topnotch you already know what the plot is about so i dont have to go over it but i will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor the ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this filmrobert downey jr is great as iron man and he does get a lot of screen time chris evans plays captain america and he does an amazing job chris hemsworth and jeremy renner were both good as thor and hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters mark ruffalo was cool as bruce banner  the hulk and he does motion capture for the hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero scarlett johannson plays black widow  natasha romanoff and she could not done better in this film but the one person who really was great is tom hiddleston as loki thors brother and he makes a good villain james spader is gonna do better as the title character ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 marvel studios film age of ultron which will be released this friday on may 1st 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as ultronaaron taylorjohnson is going to rock as quicksilver but i think mary kate and ashley olsens sister elizabeth is hot as scarlet witch and shes gonna do great in that part but samuel l jackson as nick fury is good in the screen time he has in this film but he only has a cameo or small part in the new movie which i will review on friday may 1st 2015 and i think its going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie seasonthe visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie especially the hulk in this film the music by alan silvestri is fantastic and amazing i could not believe the music that i heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it the films running time feels like its three hours long but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long so the movie moves on very quicklyoverall i love the and i am giving it an 8  10 marvel has outdone themselves with this film and they will continue to outdo themselves with other future marvel movies and its not like every day that a fouryear plan pays off with such praise and hype but this paid off wonderfully,fantasy
the 2012 dir joss whedon  cast robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo scarlett johansson here at long last is a combination of comic book superheros brought to the screen to the delight of fans hopefully nobody will confuse the title with that crap handed john steed emma peel 1998 film that everyone wanted nothing to do with perhaps a title change we have a host of superheros including iron man captain america thor the hulk hawkeye and black widow the villain is loki of the thor film and he has a world domination scheme that is every bit as corny as any other world domination scheme that doesnt matter because viewers will attend to see the combination of powers become a reality loki is a great villain and thankfully he is targeted by all of these heroes thus giving us great action sequences his runin with the hulk is especially amusing joss whedon is the right director to bring this spectacular together and the special effects created are explosive whedon also gives each cast member a good fair share of time we have robert downey jr as tony stark  iron man whose sarcasm is a scene stealer chris evans is thawed and ready as captain america chris hemsworth as thor sets to bring loki back to his planet for justice mark ruffalo is terrific filling in as the hulk whose anger is subdued until fans are given the payoff in full blown green fury scarlett johansson oozes sexiness as black widow a skilled spy trained by shield third act descends to action combination of the various talented ensemble that is a thrill score 9  10,fantasy
this is truly an incredible movie the actors were all on point and did a great job i did miss edward norton in the film but mark ruffalo definitely won me over and was very pleased with his work in this film i recommend this movie to anyone looking for a action packed film full of drama and chaos robert downey jr is probably my favorite actor and if not hes very high on my list but the commitment and work put in from the entire crew of production and filming members is one for the books im really looking toward to seeing a second part to this movie and im very confident when i say that i know it will be great if you know anything about any of these comic book heroes then im sure you didnt need to see any movies such as the iron man trilogy thor captain america or the hulk to understand this film but having seen all of those leading up to the is what made this movie incredible the investment and work put in by everyone just amazes me keep up the good work marvel,fantasy
between a massive advertising blitz and some nonetoosubtle hints that marvel has been dropping in their films for the last four years joss whedons adaptation is one of the most eagerly anticipated blockbusters in recent memory with most of marvels flagship characters played by some of hollywoods biggest stars assembled together in a big budget production cowritten and directed by the man responsible for buffy and firefly the premise alone is enough to make fanboys swoon this is a project with some very high expectations to meet and having seen it i for one would say that it has met themit would not be much of a stretch to say that the is what every summer blockbuster wants to be given a few hundred million dollars and near total creative control what director wouldnt want to make a film like this in its two and a half hour running time it delivers a coherent storyline several likable well developed protagonists and enough action and explosions to show up michal bayi mention this notorious director because his transformers films particularly the latter entries have made millions on the idea that brainless fight scenes gratuitous pyrotechnics and more than a little ta are all it takes to make an action movie no acting writing wit or originality needed but shows that thats not true like a certain other superhero franchise due to release its final installment later this summer works as much because of its human drama as its action and special effects one of the main reasons the fantastic four movies didnt work aside from weak screenplays and wooden acting was that we never bought the idea that the actors on screen were a team in the first film they utterly lacked the kind of chemistry that would be expected of friends and coworkers in the second entry the chemistry was so forced that they seemed like a sitcom family suffers from neither of these problems chris evens chris hemsworth robert downy junior scarlett johansen samuel l jackson and mark ruffalo not only shine on their own but also work seamlessly together as part of a team playing of each others strengths and personalitiesbetween starks cynicism casual arrogance and roguish charm caps loyalty and earnestness banners demur unobtrusive nerdiness and thors zeal and new found humility all of the leads get the chance to establish themselves as well rounded characters and to remind us why we liked them in the first place and like a real team the characters dont always get along from the moment they first meet they keep secrets they question each others motivations and commitments they get on each others nerves and they certainly let their egos clash in fact some of the best fight scenes are between the heroes but like real people they put aside their differences and their egos they learn to trust each other and work together in a way not nearly as sappy or clichd as it suddenly sounds when im writing it the casting of samuel l jackson as nick fury continues to seem like a better and better idea all the time he might not be able to go all out what with this being a pg13 production but there were moments that for me at least very much invoked fond memories of pulp fiction tom hiddleston also does very good work as the villainous loki his air of condescension and supreme self confidence makes him instantly loathable and the hint of jealousy and subtle desperation in his voice together with his piercing wide eyed stare gives the unmistakable impression that something is definitely not right inside his head watching the heroes give him the beating he deserves is a supremely satisfying experienceand like i said the action is great too the numerous fights and shootouts are excellently choreographed and filmed and the climactic alien invasion is stunning in its size and complexity its like a nonsucky battlefield la and the cost must have been astronomical im also highly impressed at how long the film was able to keep the action and sense of excitement going from start to finish the final battle lasted roughly half an hour without getting bogged down or becoming overly repetitiveadd in some typically whedonesque humor and a fair number of insider references to the comics is mighty entertainment and everything that fans could have hoped for i look forward to marvels inevitable followup and to the directors next project i dont know why its taken so long but joss whedon has finally arrived in hollywood and i expect to see much more of him in the near future,fantasy

when i watched iron man 2 captain america the first avenger thor i wished i could see them together in a single movie but to me it seemed impossible at that time until 2012 when i was marveled to see the trailer of the as i watched the movie it was a dream come true the reason it seemed impossible to me was that its hard to accommodate so many signature heroes in a single 25 hour movie but marvel did a really amazing job first off all the movie is a sequel to 4 or 6 movies hulk 2003 and iron man if you want to addand is prequel to 3 movies plus a tv series second marvel delivered very well every hero was at first a sole hero but gradually they ended being a team every hero had his own story plus a part in the team how the team came together was also so heartwarming and how they helped each other every hero was greatly portrayed with great graphics loads of actioncomedythrill and a great feast for comic fans and noncomic fans both,fantasy
the  as thors hammer smashes the ground causing huge ripples in the earth the smashing action blows your mind as it leaves a deep impact on you way after the film is over one of the most awaited films of the year the is everything youd expect from a awesome superhero gettogether film after loki steals the infinitely powerful tesseract from nick fury the director of shield puts together the group that hes had in the works for years gathering iron man the hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow the team of the takes on loki and his army to save the world the does not fall short of anything stunts story performances humour just everything in the right proportion humour is in abundance but no way does it make the film spooflike you feel for the characters which makes the film a roller coaster ride you dont want to miss out on do not compare it to the dark knight  nolans batman movies there is nothing dark or twisted about the its a feelgood fun film,fantasy
the plot was great its simple enough for normal movie goers to follow yet complex enough for the fans whove been following the continuity to go oh yeah this tiesin with this and this relates to that whedon really pulled it off well considering this could have gone a 100 ways wrong the pacing was also exceptional something the other 5 movies never really mastered very few questions are left unanswered by the end it really is a good well rounded story from start to finish dont expect too many easter eggs or cameos because to be honest there were almost none as a fanboy im a little disappointed but at the same time i fully understand that they didnt want another im2the characters all shine there is no star of the movie and if i absolutely had to pick id have to go with bannerhulk every single character gets hisher moments i do have a lot more to say about each individual actoractress and their respective character but i wouldnt want to spoil any of the amazing and surprising character moments i will say this though the acting from some of the guysgals were far better than i could ever have imagined and the actors of whom i was expecting great things werent as good as i thought theyd be i did have unfairly high expectations for them thoughthe action every fight sequence is straight out of a comic book youll see scenes that will immediately make you realize the guy who made this movie is a flat out comic book geek whedon knew exactly what the fans wanted and put it all in there every single fight sequel has a great flow as well  it feels so real and keep in mind youll be seeing iron man go up against a god of thunder  so when i say it looksfeels real i mean it the stunts are extremely well choreographed and it becomes clear that a lot of them were done by the actors themselves which i find very impressive the cgi was incredible some of the stills and trailers had a few cartoony shots but it all looks amazing on the big screen if you stick through the credits you wouldnt be surprised at the amount of people it took to make this movie come to life visuallythe dialog and humor well what can be said its joss whedon it was fantastic the only dialog that didnt impress me was some of the stuff with nick fury there was also a certain scene with cap and stark from the trailers thats been changed and imo it didnt really work as well as the original version i was beginning to feel a little worried that ta would be too funny after reading some of the reviews on rt but it wasnt so ill admit whedon walked a fine line and it almost ended up being a comedy but luckily i think he maintained the balance the movie was freakin hilarious though the score was impressive as well alan silvestri composed a heroic orchestra of sounds that just makes you want to start cheering that said a few of the songs were a bit too reminiscent of captfa which i found a little lazy but for the most part the overall score is great as im typing this im still whistling the themethe 3d i thought it was pretty good its not necessary that you go see it in 3d but id encourage you to do so it did add depth to the movie and when youre watching what is arguably some of the best fightbattle sequences ever captured on film youll be wishing that you could get the full experience some of the scenes very few were a bit darkblurry though  but overall coming from a guy that doesnt really like 3d id say spend the extra few bucks its not everyday that the assemble on the big screenallinall the was amazing its definitely my favorite comic book movie of all time now and easily one of the top 10 movies ive ever seen it delivers on all accounts and only has a few very minor flaws one of the best aspects of the movie is that its a rollercoaster ride its lighthearted very intense and then lighthearted again its unexpected and i never knew what was coming next its funny and serious often almost at the same time  i was a little exhausted after watching it  dont underestimate the while it is mostly an actionadventure movie its definitely not just another mindless popcorn flick it does have a sense of depth that i wasnt expecting and the characters do evolve and make you care even more than their solo movies did instant classic imo 5 out of 5 and it goes without saying im looking forward to seeing more,fantasy
a lot of comicbook fans including myself have wondered how can having six larger than life superheroes in one film possibly work will they be distributed with the right amount of screen time can there be a cohesive story to tell will there be plenty of action and visuals the list of questions goes on and onfortunately i can tell you that the hardcore fanboys can put their pitchforks down as writer and director joss whedon pulls off a magnificent achievement by bringing the right amount of stability in this superhero circus engineered to please the fanboys and nonfans alikethe film has a simple storyline but its very wellpaced filled with adrenaline and streams very nicely however its not the story that makes the film so great but rather the characters instead the script written by joss whedon never forgets its heroes humanity as the film explores each characters with a lot of depth with reasons for doing why theyre doing what theyre doing the story reconnects us with each character but also finds the time to flesh out each characters strengths and weaknesses with some wonderful moments of insecurity throughoutloki the films villain is brilliantly portrayed by tom hiddleston as a cunning mischievous and evil mastermind chris evans solidifies his role as captain america chris hemsworth portrays a more noble less arrogant thor mark ruffalo one of the characters i was worried about during the hype train of this film went beyond my expectations he delivers a new kind of bruce banner and i would argue the hulk steals this film theres also a lovely banter between jeremy renners hawkeye and scarlet johanssons black widow whedon treats them with respect and they do earn their place in the team as for robert downey jr well do i really need to tell you hes awesome as always samuel l jacksons nick fury is finally able to stretch his legs than being just the guy making surprise appearances as he is able to slide into the role quite effortlessly clark greggs agent coulson returns and provides sharp dialog in the film cobie smulders also makes her marvel film debut as agent maria hill who is nick furys second in command the visuals are great as expected the overall look of the hulk is very impressive i loved how ilm modeled it to look like a mixture of mark ruffalo and jack kirbys interpretation in the comicswe get a lot of action beats and a good amount of time is spent on having the heroes talk trash and square off against each other to prove whos the toughest theres iron man vs thor hawkeye vs black widow thor vs hulk and so on these showdowns allow each character to have their time in the spotlight and they do build genuine tension the last 20 30 minutes of this film is worth the ticket itself whedon provides plenty of jawdropping action sequences though this is a comicbook film there is a great sense of subtlety and the film explores that lets be honest in many different ways this movie should not have worked at all there are too many larger than life characters to juggle and quite frankly its ridiculous joss whedons brilliant script has a strong and unique theme of family dynamics ultimately these people dont belong together and the whole movie is about finding themselves from community while doing so they not only realize that they belong together but they need each other obviously this is expressed through punching but that essence is the heart of the filmas a comicbook fan i went into the with unfairly high expectations due to all the people who were involved in the project as well as the films that came before give massive credit to joss whedon and kevin feige the is a visual spectacle but its also a film with brains and heart at a runningtime of two and a half hours the film is well paced and time flies by so in every regard the movie fulfills its hype and raises the bar even higher for marvel and other superhero films to come and my childhood is avenged1010,fantasy
this is by far one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen the has a simple but very involved plot loki thors evil brother tries to take over the earth with an army of aliens called the chitauri shield led by director fury is charged with stopping him they attempt to unite several of the worlds most talented individuals in order to accomplish such an impossible feat this is called the initiativethenatasha romanovblack widow highly trained agent close combat specialisthawkeye the best aim with a bow that anyone has ever seen tony starkiron man genius in a suit of high tech body armor steve rodgerscaptain america supersoldier from wwii frozen in ice for seventy years after defeating hydra bruce bannerhulk gamma radiation scientist that becomes a giant indestructible green rage monster when he gets too angrythor asgardian god of thunder wields a war hammer known as mjlnirthese heroes have a rough time working together it isnt until after a major tragedy that they become willing to work together to stop loki a major theme of this movie is definitely the importance of teamwork not one of these heroes could of done this alone except maybe the hulk it took all of them to be strong enough to defeat the chitauri get back the tesseract and save the citytony stark was definitely the most dynamic character he somehow managed to turn down his ego in order to work with the other he wasnt the only one though thor went through some changes when he faced his brother again bruce banner learned to control the hulk a little better director fury never changes though he is still as cold and protocol driven as the day he was first introduced to marvel fansthe one thing i dont like about the is that it starts off a little too slow after loki steals the tesseract it takes a long time for the movie to pick up again a large portion of the beginning of the film is just a bunch of random dialogue with a few plot points thrown inother than the slow start the is an amazing scifi superhero movie with plenty of action and a plot that actually has some depth its an allaround wonderful movie and is definitely worth watching,fantasy
marvels assemble was an absolutely fantastic film it was great how they pulled all the different movies and their secrets and put them into the one film each actor played their part to their best and i was gripping my seat at every turn there was a lot of emotions in the movie including humour sadness and suspense one minute you would be crying and the next laughingthis is a great movie for the whole family but i would advise that you watch the other superhero movies first as it would be hard to follow otherwise11 out of 10 from me cant wait for 2,fantasy
when i first watched this i had never really been that into marvel films so i didnt really know what was what i hadnt previously watched iron man iron man 2 thor or any hulk movie so i do suggest watching them firstbut when i did watch it i was so totally mind blown by the pure amazement in how awesome this film was that i became a right marvel nerdmarvels assembel i one of the most amazing films i have ever seen in my life and would definitely suggest watching it this movie makes the most awesome gift and would make anyone smile,fantasy
the phenomenaltoday i watched the for the first time the movie itself i believe was very well put together not knowing who each character is and not seeing each one of their movies to get their background the movie was well put together that i understood what role each one played with the original cast of each character are in this movie except they did not use the original actor for the hulk which is what i was familiar with but the part was very well portrayed by mark raffalo  the hulk character keeps the viewers on edge wondering what or when will he release the rage of the hulkthe movie starts with that main villain loky god of mischief planning one of his ultimate plans of taking over the world the original actor tom hiddleston from the movie  thor plays an amazing part both dark and evil capturing all the characteristics of a grand villain comes to life in the amazing film and hiddleston plays the part to perfection other characters in this film include the fantastic performance of chris evans as captain america with his honor and loyal traits this character is incredibly brought to the screens with a perfect actor that does its great justice all the characters in this film are portrayed wonderfully to bring this fantasy film to life this movie also shows the truth of a community in a tragedy when all hope is lost in the movie each character mad at each other in regular life come together to get through the hard times and defeat the powerful loki this is film each actor feeds each other in this film that all the scenes connect perfectly and even if you have not seen all the individual movies of all the characters one by one the film is still pretty easy to follow and to catch up on each one and the part they play all and all i would like to say that joss whedon did an amazing job on creating each character and i hope there is more to come two thumbs up in my bookart,fantasy
joss whedon tells a story which though classic is developed in a really great way first of all an enviable and satirical script defines the pace of the work which remains strong throughout its duration accumulating tension to lead to a powerful final act this is achieved in part thanks to the great characterization of the characters very well defined in their dialogues and by the performances of the actors who easily draw the different personalities of heroes and villain as well as making the viewer vibrate with the clash of egos when they appear on screena special mention goes robert downey jr as tony stark mark ruffalo as bruce banner and tom hiddleston as loki the norse god and thors brother the latter is a successful incentive for the film the fun of seeing him interact on screen is matched only by his great performance specialy the scenes with stark natasha and thor demonstrating a complex villain even tragic although sometimes scary whose motivation while simple at first glance proves to be a multilayered one in an attentive viewing pay attention to his dialogues and facial expressions especially in encounters with thor agent coulson and his scenes in the outcomerobert downey jr keeps the level as tony stark and continues to develop his character as we saw in the first iron man stark demonstrates that despite having matured as a person hes someone who does not know how to be a team player he learns in this film that a hero is more than a cocky playboy even if said playboy has superpowersthe last but not least is bruce banner probably the most more grayest character that has the privilege of appearing on the ruffalos banner is a sad depressed man who is ashamed of himself and is considered a monster by the one surrounding him he has to learn to accept himself a great success by the director is to outline his relationship with tony stark as the contrast between the two is one of the delights of the filmit doesnt my criticism however the fact that the final conflict may not appeal to a greater or lesser extent to those who do not tolerate cgi which are really plentiful though visually spectacular in themselves during the last acthowever i must say that such scenes are well maintained not only in effects but also in style special mention to an amazing a scene where the camera follows the protagonists an artistically impressive oner which captures the might of the heroes with the soundimage comboalso whedon doesnt rely on eye candy and gives to the outcome a decent plotstructure remarkably finishing the relationships between the characters all of this seasoned successfully with good dialogue and some epic moments to make it more palatable paraprasing roger ebert like many recent films in their third acts the goes for walltowall action essentially but the director has invested well in establishing his characters so that it matters what they do in battle and how they do it there are personal issues at stake greater than simply which side winsanother negative point in my opinion is the following although the premise is developed in a great way giving shape to a somewhat simplistic plot as i said the film does not redefine any way a plot that we have not already seen before despite the fact that represents such concepts much better than any other film in its genre however although imperfect the film satisfies at all times and the scale between hits and misses is good enough to make this an excellent movie,fantasy
just saw the movie and ive gotta say it was pretty sweetknow the feeling when watching a regular 1 hour movie and halfway through you look at the time in the hopes its almost over this was really nicely paced your attention is on the screen the entire movie and at no point during did i think about time when the movie was over i was like did 220 hours just passi didnt expect much humour in this i knew stark would be a smartass so that was anticipated but i did not expect the hulk to be funny twiceall in all great movie and a good start to the trilogyquadrilogy or whatever this is going to become,fantasy
what can i say about the that everyone else hasnt already said well believe the hype its great why well numerous reasons one of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of the most iconic super teams in comics to lifejoss whedon has showed time and time again that he knows about both the marvel universe see his run on astonishing xmen and team dynamicssee firefly or any of his other worksand he works his magic to the max here another reason is the great cast while all good two performances really stand out to me the first one is mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk and the second one is tom hiddleston as loki while i enjoyed ed nortons banner i felt something was missing from him likability mark ruffalo had likability tom hiddlestons loki was a great villain that really had that sinister aura about him and hes better here than he was in thor another reason is the action not only does the final scene have an epic battle that rivals robots trashing chicago in transformers 3 this is way cooler but other great action scenes come throughout the movie one of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where loki steals the tesseractcosmic cube and takes down a whole bunch of shield agents including nick fury and hawkeye also the plot is fairly simplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character dynamics so final verdict possibly the best movie of the summer of 2012 assemble and go see it,fantasy
i have been waiting for an movie for well over a decade and when i found out that it was even in the pipeline i was beside myself with excitement i went to see the movie with somewhat high expectations due to the cast involved and the previous marvel movies building up to this title i have to say that it completely surpassed my expectations and i was amazed throughout the entire movie i attended the screening in 3d and i honestly have no idea why people had anything bad to say about the 3d in this movie as it was quite brilliant for me the underrated characters in the movie are black widow and hawkeye i felt that these characters were portrayed perfectly by scarlett johansson and jeremy renner i also felt that we have finally found a perfect actor in mark ruffalo to play the hulk the two actors that have recently played bruce bannerthe hulk have been pretty good but both seemed to be lacking in something but i could never put my finger on it i thoroughly enjoyed seeing mark ruffalo as bruce banner and the hulkoverall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie it also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness i can see exactly why there has been a massive explosion of potential marvel movies in the pipeline and i cannot wait to see what the sequel could bring i feel that hawkeye and black widow could definitely have their own movies if not a movie where they are working together i also hope that the people at marvel and disney have identified mark ruffalos great ability to play bruce bannerthe hulk in such a great way and maybe look into rebooting the entire franchisei would highly recommend this movie across all age ranges as there is something for everyone i also cannot wait for this movie to come out on bluray,fantasy
unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avantgarde short subjects in tiny projection rooms then chances are pretty good that youll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic i certainly did and i wouldnt consider myself a diehard marvel comic book fan i enjoyed the derringdo and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one but directorscreenwriter joss whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made iron man 1  2 the incredible hulk the 2008 version thor and captain america the first avenger purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the largerthanlife dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable a topnotch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3d eyepopping glory of course but much of the credit really needs to go to whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic bookrunning a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes the potentially convoluted plot allows nick fury a character heretofore limited to tantalizing postcredits scenes in the previous movies to take center stage hes the surly oneeyed leader of shield the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with loki the deceitful halfbrother of thor the norse deity of thunder loki has brainwashed archer supreme hawkeye and brilliant physicist dr erik selvig already seen in thor while stealing a cosmic cube called the tesseract a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential from a remote research facility fury recruits black widow a former russian spy last seen in action in iron man 2 to gather the troops including a highly reticent bruce banner aka the hulk meanwhile iron man captain america and thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemyloki turns out to be the least of their problems as the tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the chitauri which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of manhattan while the stateoftheart action scenes are everything you want them to be its really the films unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story realizing the escalating level of implausibility whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone and not just robert downey jr for instance after thor proclaims loki solemnly as his asgardian brother black widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which thor points out loki was adopted later in the most crowdpleasing scene the hulk grabs a character by his leg and whipslams him into the floor like hes beating a dust rag the defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here and whedons kidlike attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilaratingthe physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble while downeys scenestealing as iron man is a given chris evans captain america chris hemsworths thor mark ruffalos digitally altered hulk scarlett johanssons black widow and jeremy renners hawkeye all get their moments to shine as loki tom hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning while samuel l jackson and clark gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as fury and agent coulson respectively the mistake most filmmakers make in showing an armageddon situation is applying too much soulbaring gravitas to the proceedings thats definitely not whedons take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life its gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory,fantasy
i just keep renting it and i watch my favorite scenes over and over again each time i do its delightfully funny i like these people i like this story i love with that romanoff girl mark ruffalo is great he is just great its balanced it cannot be easy to portray superheroes but they pull it off you know they must be up against green screens but i believed it the writing is fantastic i can quote lines my friends can quote lines everyone has a favorite scene i have second third and fourth favorites its fast paced but you get to know the characters i want hollywood to know if i dont care about the characters i dont care what happens to them i have almost no memory of the grifters because yuck i like movies with nice characters and its colorful did you see the ledge it is so drab they could have saved money and filmed it in black and white youre stuck in baton rouge dude just jump gees did you see cloud atlas visually spectacular thats all its got and still id give it about a six,fantasy
after all the hype i was expecting an entertaining movie to me that means a plot and story line that i can feel a part of and be interested in what happens to the characters i pretty much became bored due to feeling no connection with the characters and nothing unexpected happeningsure there are special effects and a bunch of stuff thrown in just to see if it would stick to the wall but none of it engaging then there were characters that were so shallow that i felt no interest in who they were or what part they playeddid gwineth paltrow actually get paid for whatever it is she was doing the hulk seemed to be more of an after thought in this story as there was no consistency in his role in the hulks first scene hes an uncontrollable force that destroys anything regardless of whether it involved resources that belonged to good or evil the climax of the movie which involves an alien invasion was far from exciting due to minimal effort being made to compel the viewer into wondering oh my whats going to happen now instead the feeling evoked was gee that was an ok special effect,fantasy
i will not make this review very long but you can add it to anyone elses that gave this a 3 out of 10 first of all i will say that this film is perhaps the first one for me ever that has warranted obtaining it by pirating it from the internet i could not sleep had i spent 10 at the theater on it and for that matter 300 for a oneevening rental of it on dvdas i downloaded it i was really excited mostly just basing it off the reviews and records it set on its opening weekend and through the summer of 2012 even and wow was i so wrong in doing that keep in mind i know that it holds true to form to comic books and their characters depicted in the movie but i have seen iron man captain america and the last two incredible hulk remakes and somehow this grouping of all the marvel characters diminishes the value of all the characters individual films they lead in so much its embarrassing i really liked iron man but his one or twoliners in this film are not funny but very cheesy and predictable the costumes on some of the characters are laughably ridiculous namely loki his ramlooking horns or whatever hawkeye and his blue contacts and then cgi diminishes all of the others looks and finally it speaks enough for itself when this is just one of a very few films i have ever watched where i stopped  or paused it every 10 or 20 minutes to go do something else come back a couple hours later continue watchingonly to repeat the same thing again and again it took about a day for me to finish it i mean that just says something of how dull and dopey this film is at times all the fanboys who may argue out there dont please because i obviously realize you are a fanboy anyone else looking for a truly good oscarwinning or perhaps classic and oneforthehistorybooks type of film look elsewhere,fantasy
this movie is another typical us production great fx lame story even lamer lines for the actors espcially hiddleston whose character is completely wasted even though he plays his mad part very good only downey has his usually funny highlights but this cannot save the movie when i have figures like thor and loki i try to build a more mythical special story and dont end up with the ever so boring same mankind vs whoever fight marking the enemy almost unbeatable at the beginning and then ending up with some metal monster that the hulk can bring down what more or less usual humans like black widow and hawkeye can do to survive such a battlefield for super heroes is beyond my understanding too not to mention the usual showcasing of us equipment f35 eg and a skycarrier which in some way made me think of space battleship yamato and last but not least no one of the ones responsible seems to have read marvel comics when they have been young i did and theres no way that iron boy and miss america could hold up to thor and hulk how did iron man put it correctly in the comics with regard to thorhulk with enough energy i can keep up with those guys on the super hero top listfor two seconds the end with interviews and statements on the streets and of course before that the use of nukes to close the portal brought my till then five stars vote down to three why for whose sake ever is the enemy superior when we have nukes and they dont how could nukes close a portal made of pure energy from the cube which is  because of this fact  impenetrable unbearable us simplicity and shallowness,fantasy
lets face itim writing this review 61512 and if you havent seen the movie by now then odds are you arent planning on doing so just saying that being said im not one to post spoilers so a general review will be given actually i probably could sum it up in one statementthe hulk fricking owned this movieyes thor ironman captain america helllooooo sexy hawkeye and black widow all had their shining moments which is another layer of awesomeness to the film but anyone who watched it would more than likely agree that although the big green guy was not in many scenes he still managed to own this movie the energy of the movie is absolutely amazing and i personally cant wait until the sequel,fantasy
its been over 7 years since the movie was first announced to be developed back in april 2005 and since then the hype behind this movie has been growing and growing sincemy thoughts were that the massive build up of this movie will have fans and general movie lovers expectations to high to really enjoy and appreciate the film however i was wrong this movie was absolutely breathtaking from the opening scene and i am proud to give the my first 1010 ratingthe effects are topnotch the acting is great well done joss whedon and zak penn fantastic job the both of you and lets not forget the brilliant comic book writers in stan lee and jack kirby without you two this movie would never had existedi highly recommend this movie to any comic book fan or general movie lover out there,fantasy
when the first iron man film came out the studios behind the marvel cinematic universe were embarking on something truly unprecedented in modern cinema iron man was a relatively underpromoted movie with trailers that showed barely the surface of what to expect i went to the midnight screening of the movie with a number of friends as a social outing while they were the ones who were truly marvel comics fanatics by the end i was absolutely blown away by the strength of the movie in both its action and gravitas and after the credits when nick fury arrived played by samuel l jackson to announce the initiative i was both excited and skepticalalthough i wasnt an avid comic book fan at the time most people my age knew who the were  the worlds mightiest heroes comprising such characters which would be almost ludicrous to depict on screen in this day and age who would take a movie about captain america seriously or thor who i knew of primarily as a chief norse god and not a superhero and yet one by one each of the movies blew away all my preconceptions and expectationsthe the result of four years of meticulous buildup and hard work does not disappoint i am by no means a joss whedon fanboy but you could see his work ingrained in the dialogue the scripting and the loving attention paid to a universe that he as a comic book fan clearly cares about i remained skeptical all the way until i was physically sitting in the theater that this could be anything but an action orgy yet through the most unlikely situations they gave the film a heartthe premise is surprisingly simple  loki thors brother from his film is preparing to invade the earth with the help of an unknown benefactor and an army called the chitauri who are in fact the ultimate marvel version of the notorious skrull  minus the shapeshifting ability while taking advantage of the artifact known as the tesseract which the fans of the comics would recognize as the cosmic cube shields nick fury recognizing the threat tries to bring the team together with iron man hawkeye black widow thor and the outoftime captain america while consulting dr bruce banner whose angry side has been kept under control for some time to help find the tesseract the initial interaction between them is as expected not a cordial one though you do see the beginnings of some deep friendships beginning including one between stark and banner  evidently brought together by a penchant for genius while there are numerous shorter action sequences stringing the film together with character setpieces the finale of the movie culminates in one of the most brilliantly shot 3040 minute action sequences ive ever seen the third transformers movie attempted something similar and failed at it where this truly succeededa few things really stand out in the movie the first is the evolution of tony starks character in previous movies the main thing that had really been explored were a his ego and b his quest for redemption as rogers puts it however he seems to only fight for himself and is all about style yet in this film he manages to portray not only a semblance of heroism but participates in one of probably the most heroic acts depicted so far in a superhero film his relationship with dr banner manages to underscore just how strong his character has become  where the other team see banner as a ticking time bomb as he aptly puts at one point stark believes that not only did the hulk save banners life it is something of his nature to be embraced and taken control of instead of feared and ultimately the faith he shows in him proves to be rightanother strong element of the film as in most joss whedon productions is the uplifting of a strong female character namely black widow natasha romanoff had a bit part in the second iron man film but wasnt the real focus of the film nor was she fully explored as a character this film provides a strong focus into her psyche as a master assassin and highlights her relationship with hawkeye the master marksman shes surprisingly one of the films most inscrutable characters showing only enough emotion as she needs but being capable of great loyalty compassion and heroism despite her and clint barton being the two nonsuperheroes on the team they provide an absolutely integral part of the team their role is irreplaceable on the team and they kick as much butt as the rest of the hyperpowered team members at no point in the movie did i feel like any one super hero was used to prop up the others like a crutchand finally without a doubt mark ruffalos portrayal of both bruce banner and the hulk is probably one of the best ever to hit the screen previous movies had touched on the strength of the hulk and his potential for limitless strength while highlighting banners genius and compassionate nature but it has never been done quite so well he steals the movie ultimately surpassing all expectations against all the odds he grows rapidly both literally and figuratively throughout the movie gaining a new sort of confidence before the film i wasnt a huge fan of the hulk but afterwards i have infinitely more respect for the character  mixed in with a touch of respectful fearthis movie is definitely worth watching in theaters on the big screen the experience is 100 worth it all i can say is the dark knight rises has a lot to live up to if it hopes to do anywhere near as well as this monster of a film,fantasy
i went to this movie with very very high expectations and to no surprise they were not only met by the movie they were over exceeded you almost dont have screen time without action excellently crafted dialogs or scenes that make you laugh audience including me applauded and laughed during the movie not ones also you dont have time to think about whats going to happen next in the story and thats because movie sucks you in so much you have enough time to just be focused on whats going on right in front of you and whats in front of you is moments you dont want to miss on top of that you have awesome effects and very good acting you cant not to love tony stark this movie managed to make me feel like a little kid again and it was awesome,fantasy
i avoided to write the review of this movie because i thought there were many reviews of this onein the end i had to write it because i was not able to resist the temptation of this flick i have seen thousands of movies but there was no one like thisas a child and till i saw i always dreamed of watching all the super heroes togetherwhen i heard about the i always thought the director wont be able to do justice to so many charactersbut this movie changed my thoughtfrom the moment the movie starts you are lost in itevery scene is just about perfectall the super heroes look greatyou will be surprised by the amount of comedy in this movie because you expect it to be a complete action onei can assure you that you will watch this as many times as you want but you will feel the same that you felt first timeand surely you will want to be an avenger no matter what your age is i have been dreaming this movie since i saw itwhy to watch the best movie of all timesuper actionawesome comedy some classical actingthoriron mancaptain americahulkhawkeyeblack widow and 3d qualitywhy not to watch watch it otherwise you will be missing a revolution,fantasy
having seen the previous marvel movies i have to say this was probably their best work so far this movie caters to all ages with plenty of laughs and omg moments sure the beginning had a bit of a slow start but once it got on its feet wow iron man had a big part in this being the hilarious immature playboy to thor and captain americas more serious nature scarlett johansson played the part of black widow perfectly and hawkeye and the hulk were both splendid the villain loki stepped out of the typical bad guy shadow and made the perfect enemy for these amazing heroes the effects didnt have that sick cg look a lot of other hero movies have and the plot was believable ill admit i shed a few tears in some scenes but seconds later they brought the laughs right back overall an excellent family movie,fantasy
warning this review may contain spoilers the was definitely worth a wait i enjoyed every second of it and iron man played an important part in the whole film and he was also my favorite superhero this movie was so special in 5 ways 1 the anticipation 2 the trailers 3 the cast 4 the villains 5 the hulk the hulk was a complete monster in the movie and i was glad he fought thor but the assets black widow and hawkeyedid a phenomenal job in their part of the movie scarlett johansson was amazing thor was more aggressive in this movie than in his own movie oh thor vs iron man was my favorite fight scene captain america played a good role in the film loki was lethal and unpredictable in the movie i was laughing so hard when hulk smashed loki into the floor when i seen the movie the day it came out may 4th 2012 every single person in the audience was laughing so hard in the postcredits scene i was so surprised to see thanos i knew their was going to be something after the credits and im going to do that every time i see a marvel movie btw im glad they showed thanos in the postcredits scene phenomenal movie go see it asap,fantasy
i should start this review by saying that i am a massive comic book fan and have been for as long as i can remember whenever a new comic book movie comes out i get very excited and am either satisfied more than satisfied disappointed or mildly annoyed when i actually see the damn thing the marvel cinematic universe earth199999 has been building steadily since iron man more than satisfied and has been coming along nicely brick by brick with the incredible hulk yet to see iron man 2 satisfied thor satisfied captain america the first avenger more than satisfied adding more and more detail and continuity to the mountain we have now reached the more than satisfied which climbs to the peak of the mountain to take its place as the epitome of an awesome movie i went into the excited disbelieving that this was actually happening and very very scared about how much i would enjoy it due to the massive hype surrounding the film i came out in a state of great pleasure and i thank the stars that marvel studios chose cult television genius joss whedon to direct and write it why did i love this movie so much 1 joss whedon brought the spirit skill humour and knowledge that this film needed his previous works that i have seen dr horribles sing along blog and firefly prove that he can create great drama and many memorable lines both meaningful and hilarious his twentyfive issue run on astonishing xmen proves that he knows marvel characters very well and can write great superheroes with very human flaws 2 the actors were downright perfect for their roles and each one got an equal role to play robert downey jriron mantony starkchris evanscaptain americasteve rogers chris hemsworth thor god of thunder and samuel l jackson nick fury director of shield have already proved in previous films that they are great choices for marvels movies scarlett johansson black widownatasha romanov got just enough screen time in iron man 2 to show she was a good choice for the character but in this she proves to be the best we could possibly ask for jeremy renner hawkeyeclint barton appeared for five seconds in thor to shoot an arrow or two so he obviously proved nothing in that movie but in this one he proves to be a superb choice for one of my longtime favourite marvel characters mark ruffalo the hulkbruce banner is the only main newcomer in this film due to edward norton and marvel disagreeing with each other after the incredible hulk and proves to be a perfect choice for bruce banner certainly better than eric bana in the horrible outing the hulk tom hiddleston loki god of mischief proved excellent in thor and continues his excellence in this clark gregg agent phil coulson plays the only character created specifically for these films and has become a fan favourite through his brief appearances in previous marvel pictures agent coulson really gets his chance to shine in this film and shine he does 3 it set things up very nicely for future entries in the series4 the character interactions were incredible and all of the heroes and villains were smartly developed something you can be guaranteed in a joss whedon production 5 it looked great the costumes the fight scenes etc were all very well designed 6 it had heart something you dont get in most blockbusters 7 stan lees cameo 8 post credits sequence 9 harry dean stantons cameo 10 the hilarious lines such as puny god these are just a few of the many reasons the worked so well for me and all in all i have to say that my expectations were incredibly high and the went above and beyond what i was expecting,fantasy
wow it has finally arrived marvel has had one hell of a project coming up with movies exploring the origin stories of some of the most iconic superheroes of all time while adding small but subtle connections to each other as a way to show fans what is coming over the horizon the result is an allout marvel mash as earths mightiest heroes have come together to face a threat no one hero could possibly face alone they are theloki the god of mischief has come to conquer the earth with an unspeakable alien force to back him up to make matters worse he has obtained an ancient artifact with virtually limitless power as his disposal in desperation nick fury director of the peacekeeping organization shield assembles together the greatest heroes the world has ever seen captain america iron man thor black widow hawkeye and the incredible hulk if these extraordinary independent individuals can learn to work together their combined might be enough to conquer this global threatthis is every comic book geeks dream team and dream movie the faces we have all grown up with and come to love finally together in one film normally such a task is highly risky because not only do the filmmakers have to be faithful to the comics but also appeal to what the fans would want to see in the not to mention avoid any plot holes thankfully this movie does it all plus more it is dare i say it incredible the action scenes are some of the best in the superhero genre lots of shooting punching and of course smashing things get really insane and everything in sight gets totally destroyed as the forces of good and evil duke it out all the characters have practically equal back story interactions and amount of fighting even characters like hawkeye black widow and nick fury with this not one seems left out or doesnt get enough of these elements dialog is written very well and theres a surprising amount of comedy throughout the film and its hard not to laugh with it theres lots of great moments and none of it seems the least bit cornyin conclusion this will satisfy anyone especially the fans everything people hope to see is brought to life and it kicks serious butt with fantastic action scenes excellent special effects wellwritten script cool music and surprisingly great comedy the is sure to satisfy in every way on a scale of one to ten i would give this movie a twenty its a shame i cant physically give such a rating go check out this awesome flick and enjoy assemble,fantasy
i went into this movie with an assumption i figured that the action scenes would be awesome marvel had shown that they were very capable of great action sequences and this would be no exceptionhowever action alone doesnt make a good movie matrix sequels this was the part that i was worried about would the story and characters be good enough to match the explosive action the answer is a resounding yes great character interactions hilarious dialog a true comic book story not deep like dark knight but fun like iron man all of the characters have roles that feel natural and the dialog flows robert downey jr getting joss whedon lines is as good as it sounds and i never realized how hilariously awesome the hulk could bethere are a few problems i had with the movie such as captain americas back story no wait i really just hated the captain america movie this movie met my expectations which were enormously high so to surpass them this would have had to be the second coming of christs type of awesome,fantasy
it took iron man iron man 2 the incredible hulk thor and captain america to build up to this and was it worth the wait yes in deednick furysamual l jackson brings together captain americachris evans iron manrobert doney jr thorchris hemsworth bruce bannerthe incredible hulkmark rufalo black widowscarlett johansson and hawkeyejeremy renner in hopes of stopping lokitom hiddleston from world dominationit was worth it all the way through samual l jackson this time is front and center and really shines in the role of nick fury so does everybody else mark rufalo really brings his own to bruce banner although i do miss edward norton in the role rufalo does quite well and tom hiddleston is quite menacing as loki more so then he was in thor2011 he was the best villain almost tops the joker the rest of the cast are pretty good also the effects are great the battle scenes are epic this is a marvel film that should not be missed,fantasy
superman the movie the dark knight and the yes the does indeed stand tall amongst the greatest superhero movies of all timea stellar cast assemble to create a marvel of a film pun definitely intended the special effects are top notch and never look out of place like superhero movies of the past however it is truly the story that is most appreciated since it is the final act of an intricate tightly woven plot that has been building through the current generation of marvel films iron man the incredible hulk thor and captain america the first avenger and ends with the best superhero finale ever conceived for the big screen yes its that good the only factor that could have been reduced was the amount of humour and sarcasm following certain kickass scenes which could have benefited with a touch of cool in retrospect the humour mostly gets it right and compliments the comic book feel of the movie which is what we have all desperately wanted for so long a comic book movie that truly sets your mind free like the comic books and cartoons we all read and watched growing up thinking anything was possiblei applaud you marvel as the now stands as one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie of all time,fantasy
i rarely review any movie titles purely because i watch so many films it would be impossible to review them all assemble however was a special casei not only rate this as the best comic book movie ever crafted but also as one of the best films ever made it had heart comedy action animation character development suspense all neatly encompassed in a smooth and flawlessly flowing joss whedon storylineeach character has hisher moment of glory and not one of the actorsactresses feel short of the high expectations placed upon their shoulders chris evans as captain america is and always will be my favourite character in this marvel film series and he shined brighter than ever in his second role reprisali cannot more highly insist you see this film whilst it is in the cinemas in 3d if you possibly can as it adds depth and enchances the cgi especially on the tanked body of the hulk and the none cgi behind of miss scarlettthe assembled in perfect form lets bring on the next one,fantasy
i just got back from the movie theater where i saw the without spoiling anything i must say it is indeed a spectacular spectacular and i hope to find time to watch it again in the near future its an action bonanza laced with fine performances i love the arguments between captain america and iron man cleverly delivered by chris evans and robert downey jr clever humor and not surprisingly marvel universe references anyone who is a comic reader or a marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters the plot and the images even with the daunting challenge of presenting the as an entertaining allstar gathering director joss whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars the script was nicely done and the dialogue really reflect the minds of each character really the is the complete package of entertainment that engaged me with lots of thrills and absolutely no boring moments i highly recommend it,fantasy
this is a joke of a movie thats far from funny i cant believe this movie gets 83 currently on imdb so this is on par with all those classic movies that score an 83 those movies that people will enjoy for decades to come im stunned how well this has been received anyone over the age of 7 that has given this film a good review should be ashamed the absolute saturation of cgi is disgusting and seems to be enough to forgive the many flaws of this movie the action is as poor as the humor which is brutal im not against the marvel characters i grew up with them i know you cant go into certain movies with a critical eye all i expected from my trip to the cinema was to be entertained instead i was saddened shocked and bored to the point of irritation i seen the amazing spiderman recently that was entertaining the reason was because there was some thought and effort but into all aspects of the movie as it should be to the character and story it had everything that the lacked,fantasy
ive been using for a while a rating system that considers a watchability factor acting and plot the rating system goes from 1 to 10 with 5 points given to the watchability factor 2 for the acting and 3 for the plotthe scoring works as followswatchability factor 5  spectacular worth watching over and over again4  outstanding will watch several times 3  really good movie will watch more than once 2  good movie may watch more than once 1  ok movie but once is enoughacting 2  spectacular oscar worthy 1  really good enhanced the plot0  movie wasnt about the actingplot 3  spectacular nothing else like it in the genre nominated for best picture oscars 2  makes you think well after unique 1  interesting idea  story 0  run of the millthe one point for being an ok movie but thats it no acting no plot no value just explosions and silly jokes terrible just skip it,fantasy
this is the most overrated movie of this year there is nothing special in the movie except few humour the story is pretty old and and we can bow for the special effectbut the special effect has been wasted for such a movie with no story movie such as darknight has rating of 89 which is worth but this movie is not worth for such ratingsits a childish story please give good ratings for good movies movie is worth watching once but surely this is not special movie for such hyper ratinghollywood movies of recent days does not have good story but gives more importance to special effect,fantasy
deceived by the praise and high ratings this movie received here i decided to watch it even though i didnt like thor couldnt sit through the propaganda that was captain america and thought that both of the ironmen were only average the movie is just fighting explosions destruction to infinity and the action isnt anything that you havent seen before there is just more of it which doesnt make it better  it just makes it become boring and repetitive really fast scattered amongst those are retarded dialogs and stupid oneliners seasoned with terrible acting and corny motivational speeches in the vein of god bless america and make the rest of the world or rather universe its colony samuel l jackson was unbelievably terrible scarlett johansson was terrible and was that sherlock holmes wearing a suit of armor i could have sworn that the character was the same only the name was different so much for robert downeys versatility the rest of the cast followed suit the only decent actor in this movie was tom hiddleston  but his character was ruined by the writers loki is supposed to be a god but here he is so mediocre that it is ridiculous his mighty spear is nothing more than a very low grade laser gun which doubles as a mind control tool that doesnt work all of the time and when it does work it does not work all that well the mighty fearsome aliens turn out to be mere cannon fodder dropping like mosquitoes characters level of strength and power changes throughout the movie to suit the need of the moment there are 2 yes two funny scenes and both include the hulk beating up people that should give you an idea about the quality of the funny parts of the movie i guess to like this one you would either have to be a die hard fan of the or a die hard fan of mindless repetitive boring action this movie doesnt require suspension of belief to be enjoyed it requires suspension of brain functions,fantasy
this is one movie that i went into with really low standards but i was sadly still disappointed theres no story line a terrible script annoying characters and pointless endless hoards of enemies who what to kill everyone like usual for some reason the special effects are alright but thats to be expected as they have the budget for it but to be honest the only thing that kept me watching this major disappointment was scarlett johansson in that tight costume thats it thats simply not enough for a huge blockbuster that was supposed to unite all of these massive superhero movies of late dont waste your time with this movie i will just add that this movie isnt as bad as captain america or thor both of which i walked out of,fantasy
this film is a steaming pile of turd ive never disliked joss whedon i love buffy and fireflyserenity but hes not a very good director the actors seem to suffer as much confusion as their characters do almost like as torn as they are to join shield and the in the film is how torn the actors must feel from scene to scene as to why theyre even in this filmcaptain america does not seem like a 1930s man ive seen better period acting in mad men and the like i was looking for some authenticity in him thor is paying so much attention to his hair he seems to have forgotten his point and scarlett johansson is horrific shes so monotonously apathetic it shines through in her character and the only part of her face that shows any sign of acting is her eyebrow when it raises at one point the left one it wasand this film is the longest bad film ive ever had the stupidity to watchanother point that peeved me is that the action is so ridiculously loud but the speaking so quiet in comparison it was like every explosion was happening inside my head and every conversation was in the next room over and i was listening inthe gets 1 point for the team dynamic when theyre altogether its interesting to watch and 2 points for robert downey jr hes a whole lot of man but even his humour and acting is outweighed by the stink of the rest of the film so it gets 3 out of 10 from me and a black mark against mark ruffalo who was a credible actor in my eyes,fantasy
as a 1960s marvel and dc comics fan i have watched the film adaptations with interest over the years and frankly have been rather disappointed poorest of all is the marvel universe of comic characters a bunch of dullards dressed up as something interesting and worst of all is when they get together as in this the first outing of the tony starks iron man is the worst of an utterly boring bunch but only just as he has some serious competition from the less than one dimensional black widow hawkeye and captain america the plot what there was of it was lamentable and the hopeless friction between the super heroes seemed nothing more than a way to pan out two hours rather than adding anything to the actual movie nick fury added a bit of interest but was underused and shield looked more like the men from uncle with a bit of captain scarlet thrown in but less interesting loki was a very poor villain and the alien invasion was one of the worst ever conceived this type of film is made for a very intellectually challenged american audience and had all the ingredients to satisfy them lots of explosions and plenty of american flags to cheer at but i always thought marvels characters were a lot more interesting than this bunch of costumed bores maybe i saw it through rose tinted shades back then but what i remember was a lot better than this tripe i will admit thor captain america and the new hulk film were reasonably well done but iron man i and ii left me cold and i was a big fan of him as a kid but the was a mess the dc side green lantern aside has for me been done a lot better especially the batman adaptations marvel not so sadly one of the worst bits was the sentimentality card played via a rather sad and pathetic agent coulson who up till thn had been a rather interesting character this device used to galvanise the fractured super force into an unstoppable storm of red white and blue and some green the witty one liners become tired and overused as the film drags itself to an inevitable conclusion and the final battle in manhattan was done better in cloverfield its a shame as these guys were my heroes as a kid in the 60s but now as an old man all i see are a bunch of prats in halloween costumes luckily i have the final batman movie still to watch so its not all doom and gloom in the costume hero stakes but this lot should be retired as they are nothing but frauds,fantasy
there are not many films that are good enough in my opinion to make me go and see it five times at the cinemas however from start to finish the was an excellent example of how to develop a reasonably detailed plotline whilst maintaining an unrelenting series of action sequencesthe chemistry between each of the already well established characters was fantastic getting a good balance of all personalities with wholesome and righteous from captain america sarcastic and nonchalant from iron man zen and rage from bruce banner they really managed to cover all the sides of human emotion and hero stereotypesat the end of the day if you want the most unexpected ground shattering storyline with serious reallife connections tho may not be the best movie for you however if you want a brilliantly laid out series of action sequence funny one liner small plot development action sequence action sequence and bigger action sequence this movie is going to rock your world,fantasy
what happens when you get a team of super heros together who shouldnt be in a room together let alone trying to save a city you have the one of the most anticipated movies for years i remember working at a movie theater back in 2007 and one of the guys that worked there was telling me about how there was talks to make the film and i thought it was never going to happen well clearly this is why im not in the stock market but when i heard that joss whedon was behind it i couldnt wait hes the creator of buffy the vampire slayer and is one of hollywoods best writers he has a genuine love for comics action and giving characters real depth after viewing the you couldnt ask for better action on the big screen and so much great excitement i think the fans got everything they were asking for and deserved with this great popcorn flicknick fury arrives at a remote research facility during an evacuation the commander explains that an energy source of unknown potential has activated and opened a mysterious portal through it steps the exiled loki who takes the tesseract and uses his abilities to control the minds of several shield personnel including agent clint barton and a few others in order to aid in his getaway in response to the attack fury reactivates the initiative agent natasha romanoff dr bruce banner agent phil coulson tony stark and steve rogers with an assignment to retrieve the tesseract from loki however thor lokis adoptive brother arrives and attempts to free loki to reason with him when that doesnt work the heros start fighting over whos in charge until they realize that lokis ego is growing stronger and will destroy the world if they do not stick together and stop him as thefirst off the actors robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo and scarlett johansson all clicked so amazingly well together im still a little bummed that they couldnt get edward norton for the hulk he was a perfect cast and just excellent in the incredible hulk but mark gives his own take to the character and comes through in the end the effects are so amazing and grand to watch on the big screen that this was the only way you should see the movie as they are just tearing new york apart with all these aliens and flying creatures in the middle of down town manhatten now one of the things i do have to laugh a little at is that all the characters get these cool costumes sleek sexy and toughthen you have captain america who looks like he got his costume at target you cant blame the officer he tells to get the police to get the civilians to safety and the officer asks and who are you that i should be taking these orders from there are some great comedic moments especially with robert downey jr and the hulk just going crazy on lokithere are a couple of flaws in the film like loki i dont know if it was the actor tom hiddleston but i just couldnt really take him seriously as a villain i found the aliens who were invading more threatening as loki just keeps saying kneel before me i am a god and giving you a used car salesmans smile there are moments where it seems to drag a little with the talking as were getting our heros together im all for development but i wanted a wwe smack down because were not given as much depth with these characters as you would say spiderman or batman but i think im just nitpicking at this point because i dont want to put anyone off on the filmthe is everything you could ask for in a superhero film its got great action excellent chemistry good style and is just a ton of fun to watch i got to see this in a crowded theater where you can tell the audience was just pumped up to see something good and you got to give the film credit for bringing some excitement to the theater we dont get many exciting films that have actual good writing to it like this joss did an excellent job handling these big guys on the screen and im looking forward to the sequel though i hope there is more egging on of the hulk i would have a ton of fun if i were next to him saying what captain america was talking about his mama810,fantasy
i would give it 7 or 75 out of 10 it is a very good film but nothing great believe me or not i watched it yesterday night at the south delhi pvr priya cinema hall 3d hated their scratchy defective glasses which needed changing for many peoplethe first half was just okay actually even boring and the intermission point was so illtimed and then the second half was good the fight scenes in the city manhattan are like the latest transformers a one time watch for sure but dont expect much i liked the film but not as much as i had expected it to like there are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames particularly in the first half is also abundant the villain is not so menacing or dignified like the allpowerful villain of xmen 3 he needed more teeth and i am not alone in thinking so five of my friends with me have similar opinion you dont miss much if you miss the,fantasy
i have to say im obsessed with superhero movies i love most of them so i was one of the most excited people to see iti think it was alright not more or less it seemed to me as if all the were redundant except for iron man because every time they fought he came and made it right i also didnt like most of the acting  scarlett johansson was more than a waste for the story she just had no meaning and her character wasnt necessary in any way i also dont understand why everyone liked hulk so much i think mark ruffalo did a great job with playing the angry professor but as hulk just no he couldnt get a single giggle out of me the only one that really impressed me was loki  i loved him already after the first minutes of thori admit im not a professional review writer in fact its my first one so it may be really bad but i had to say that i just didnt like it i was expecting so much maybe that was my fault i will watch the movie again maybe its one of these movies which only make an impression after the first 3 views,fantasy
ive seen the inflated review aggregate and at the risk of being dismissed a contrarian i seriously disagree with the accolades the movie i saw contained no character development whatsoever no character starts off ignorant growing to enlightenment or overcomes cowardice to become a hero or any other example of behavioral character arcs by the end they are as they begun unchanged and definitively twodimensional the lack of character development is compounded by uninteresting witless filler dialogue despite a few oneliners which managed to draw a giggle with dr stark and dr banner ie the alter egos of ironman and the hulk occasionally foraying into esoteric scientific jibberjabber that only served to bore me even more in saying that downey jrs tony stark was the only mildly interesting and amusing character in the entire piece the rest of the characters i couldnt give a shite about despite liking them in their standalone movies it seems director joss whedon and pen pal zak penn are unaware of the law of diminishing returns whereby the repetition of anything  in this case fistfights and gun and superpower battles  eventually numbs to the point of indifference speaking of indifference the limpwristed laughable hornwearing villain loki was about as menacing as having a series of ping pong balls pitched at you and the death of no spoiler here was about as emotionally moving as having your pet weevil larvae die effectswise it seems despite the advances in cgi made by avatar and rise of the planet of the apes the decided to go retrograde the hulk looking nothing more than a threedimensional cartoon and likewise with ironman and the endless stream of generic alien henchmen the greenscreen for the most part looked phony due to the artificial interior lighting illuminating the actor mismatching the natural exterior light of the background  an ageold problem that some directors dont seem to care about however seriously it affects the suspension of disbelief anyway enough of my moaning if you like mindlessaction with practically no story other than goodies versus baddies and if youre a fan of mighty morphin power rangers youll love this,fantasy

the is a fun movie it looks great visually and has a classic comic book plot the issue is there is nothing original or inspiring about it it lacks drama and the ability to get you lost in the plot it is terribly predictable and never once has the viewer worried or wondering what will happen next yes its a fun and awesome comic book movie but i would say its much more of a novelty than a great work of art the dark knight series were all base off comic books yet had an edge added to them to make the viewer connect to the characters and actually worry because they need knew what would happen next like most great movies the fails to do this throughout the film there is nothing innovative about the plot there is no true tension in the film i would normally rate this film as a 56 out of 10 but i cant since there are so many high ratings simply said the is a fun simple movie with great visual effects that can bring you back to childhood it is not a horrible film but it is not a work of cinematic art by any means and i do not feel like it deserves a rating as high as some of the most classics and original films we have to offer rate,fantasy
i was drawn into watching this movie by the promising graphics more than anything else im not a comic book aficionado in the least so i went into the movie without any of that background knowledge nor did i need it as i soon found out theres enough back story inserted to get folks through  the back story of the characters isnt really integral to the story i thoughtthe plot was very predictable there was nothing new or original about it can easily see where the story is heading and pretty easy to guess how it will end so in that regard id give the movie a 1 out of 10where this film shines  and is downright amazing  are the majority of the graphics fantastically intricate cgi work from that aspect id give the movie a 9 out of 10so basically this is a great one if youre looking for mindless entertainment as the story line isnt a challenge to follow definitely a feast for the eyes,fantasy
i am hulkthe powerhouse the boiling bed the grizzly machismo and the ultimate hammerhead he knows how to pump up your very source of adrenalinei regret that i watched this movie late but it was due to my exams that i wasnt able to do so but if you still havent seen it yet i tell you bluntly you are a fool is the best superaction movie i have ever seenits not due to the story not due to the theme not due to the super star cast the real hero of this movie was the awesome special effects and of course that includes hulkthe arena is all set we have ironman hawkeye thor hulk captainamericaand black widow to set the stage on fire and what are they facing gargantuan bulk biomechanical aliens with a centralized connection system they lay down the new york city to dust smoke and metallic rubblethere wasnt a single moment that you actually feel bored or out of place this movie kept me glued to the screen throughoutnow for the charactershawkeye he is a good guy turned bad guy then once again into a good guy dont let his metamorphosis confuse you because his explosive arrow for those who understand brahmasthra indeed made me reminiscent of the good old fight between hindu gods and demons he is good but still just a little bit less than the othersblack widow dont even dare take her at her face value she is never what she appears to be she is docile and meek when she wants to leech out information from you but ruthless and super daring when she stomps down the aliens to their gory end best scene the way she takes control of the alien ship she may soon stump down emma watson as my favourite heroinethor he is a force to reckon with literally the power to wield thunderbolts never ever ceases to amaze me and it didnt in this movie there was an awesome fight sequence between ironman and thor best scene the way he makes the entire skyscraper an electric conductor and focuses the electricity on the warp hole blowing the bulky snaky aliens to smithereenscaptain america though low on actual power he can still wield his shield and send thor flying away distances he is the captain cool one who likes to plan out things and do accordingly a tad oldfashioned of course he is oldfashioned he is old the scientists literally thawed him back to life but he more than makes up with his patriotism and his ironwill to see it through the endironman a billionaire genius and a philanthropist ironman is indeed the superhero with panache he can be the style icon for all the superheroes the way he undoes his suit is awesome uber cool gadgetry superb dialogues and a sexy iron suit that can do cool different tricks oh man he was simply superb of course he takes away the cake when he directs the nuclear missile through the warp hole and into the heart of the alien strongholdhulk no comparison he according to me was the life and soul of this movie well i must complain that these hollywood blockbusters always show india in poor light even though that part does not represent india as a whole maybe they have the great indian poverty fetish or the dharavi syndrome well but this feeling of being disparaged does not last long as we soon see the doctor awakening the green bulky giant within and being transformed into hulk there are actually three city moment of success related to him 1 the way he pounds the great snaky alien to dust 2 the way he punches thor 3 now this was the best scene of the move he thrashes up loci in the very chota bheem style that was awesome i can still remember the reaction that loci gavemaybe it doesnt have much of a story but alien invasion movies are not meant to have one what they are meant to have is spectacular fireworks and this had those aplentyevery time i see a movie like this my heart pumps faster my whole body gets filled with tout electrical energy it is as if i were a character inside the movie i loved the feeling i loved the moviemiss it at your own peril,fantasy
i dont believe anyone wouldnt enjoy it and so i would recommend it but at the same time i felt the urge to write a cautionary review to try and add to the expulsion of some of the 910 star hype and the ridiculous 1 star reviewsi felt a little tired the night i went to watch this film but since id booked tickets i went anyway i think this might be why i came out feeling it wasnt aweinspiring my tiredness stopped me from enjoying the nonstop conceptual interfaces the flash and the cgi when you are less aware of these aspects what is underneath is not as highconcept as is made out what i found was a slightly bumbling first half and an actionpacked second half i believe if you got this home when it comes out and watch it on an average tv on dvd you wouldnt be as impressedwith so many stories to include there isnt much exploration of any particular area we have a fair bit of time dedicated to learning a little about each character but given it does nothing more than glance across the surface why bother at all why not give us more indepth insight into the mechanics of the how and why a creative discussion on well something  anything and let the audience infer the rest by showing us in character reactions etc then let the second half letripim no film buff but it seems to me that when you stop and actually compare films of imdbs claim to be equal in calibre  we have the being better than taxi driver alien and only 02 behind empire strikes back  obviously you cant really compare the films because theyre so different but its a point about the ratingsin the characters we see half interesting and half onedimensional with a strange amount of time relatively speaking being given to aspects that dont really push the film forward sorry for the lack of procritique  like i said im not a film buffi didnt know this was a joss whedon film until after i watched it and this makes sense  a lot of his stuff is amazing and deep subtle and telling yet then you get other work like dollhouse which falls down by picking the wrong kind of area to focus onits worth a watch though and if you like comic book films like iron man obviously youre going to enjoy this for those less interested in that stuff dont expect 9 or 10 stars,fantasy
what a terrible terrible movienone of the characters and i do mean none is remotely interesting in fact the only character to really stand out is iron man but his ironic punchlines get old very very fast hes just there for comic relief but by the time he pours his 20th joke its just annoyingthe action scenes are just boring watching computermade polygons fight each other hardly matches my definition of excitement if only i cared about the characters i might have enjoyed them but since i didnt it was just a borefest heres the thing about hollywood they try to make action scenes as impressive as possible but if you do not care about the characters you wont care about what happens to themyou would have just as much enjoyment reading the script than watching this movie because the direction is non existent this movie embodies everything thats wrong with hollywood nowadays nothing is new or surprising in this movie if you havent seen a hollywood movie for 4 years you might enjoy this one otherwise youll just be bored by the same old crap as usual,fantasy
i dont care that much about special effects or budget but the story and logic and fun is most important for any movie this movie failed in many areas esp you need brain damage to accept the story to put hulk into a flying ship is just some example how fail the story is well to put hulk into enemy flying ship is somewhat clever but put it into own flying ship wtf problem with all these superhero movies is that by definition no hero can die so actually you already know the end of the movie before it start ironman put off his armor 50 of the movie despite they are permanent in war and always contact with enemy the movie was very slow too as it took about 100min to introduce all the new characters and give them some fake glue to form a team when the enemy finally arrived which was about 5min before the end of the movie i didnt even see how the high advanced enemy can win over the street ny policemen with hand pistols for strange reason the us army didnt join the fight so ny policemen with some heroes did the job alone loki as the only villain in that movie acted like a joke and fitted seamless into that crap movie i still dont get it how can you put a super hero as loki with near unlimited god powers into a glas cage and call that secure,fantasy
this movie is just another one of marvels ploys to get money after pushing out a mess of films forced to tie in with this once you get a 2 hour generic plot with characters who have generic back stories and abilities and are forced to work together and undoubtedly come together as one it is not an original plot or even creative i fail to see how long scenes of fighting with the camera cutting back and forth is entertaining if you actually truly like this movie please go see a doctori cant wait to see how the second film turns out marvel makes money purely being marvel not because their films are outstanding and groundbreaking they all have a generic plot and generic heroes we need god to save us,fantasy
when i sat down to watch the i had little if not any hope that i would enjoy it but i was wrong what happened when the film started was a collection of events that changed my little hope attitude into something much different after the opening scene i was to say the least entertained but when i tasked myself with the painfully easy job of rating this film all this film isis entertainment in a time of dazzling cgi and insanely fun action sequences the lives up to the hype but in a world of intriguing plot immersing performances and emotional roller coaster rides the is nothing but another transformers movie let me elaborate fans of the marvel comics will love this movie because it does what it says on the tin it effectively brings the heroes not all of them but some together in a fist fight with a destructive foe to a marvel fan this is gold to a film fan however this movie is little more than a popcorn flick people enjoying this movie is not my issue i want people to enjoy movies but when it comes to the rating systems on imdb and rotten tomatoes etc people have wrongly rated the near to the highest of all ratings films like the godfather alien shane vertigo psycho blade runner goodfellas jaws and many many more films deserve the high rating because these are cinematic masterpieces these are films which changed cinema and have set the benchmark for all genres of todays films but when i see the at the top of the ratings with them it disgusts me it should be rated fairly on an accurate basis of how the film is crafted and the impact it makes and for me it is a 4 dont get me wrong this is not a bad movie but it is not a classic nor by far a masterpiece which renders most fans reviews redundant people can love this movie hell it can be there favorite movie of them all but they need to understand it is nowhere near the giants of cinema its not worth all the hype but its fun its not a clever film the themes have been done to death and the twists are terrible but its entertainmentso i bid you farewell,fantasy
thethe story of a group of superpowered people well some of them anyway who are recruited by a secret agency to stop a threat that apparently one hero alone cant fight such liescaptain americachris evans the so called leader of the a nice person to the point of garystudom he is one of the most boring characters in the movie i watched the for the first time a few months ago on netflix and caps origin movie was on there as well and i tried to watch it but only got to the 30 minute mark and shut it off i was bored to proverbial tears i dont get the appeal for me he has no presence and is as forgettable and boring as hawkeye and black widowironmanrdj the real leader in my opinion he seems to be the focus for most of the important plot points and he is the one who untimely saves newyork he just has a presence that the rest of them lacked where the heroes were concerned the movie was more like ironman featuring the and i actually didnt have problem with thatout of them all i loved his costume the most and seeing him here has made me want to go out and see his origin movie and sequelsthor chris hemsworth thor is decent by himself but the interest level really comes in when hes playing against tom hiddlestons loki hemsworth and hiddleston play well off each other they have great chemistry and their lovehate brother dynamic is always fascinating to watch this is a shame that this was barely touched on in thors own movie since to me the family dynamic is the meat of their stories i loved watching their scenes in this movie the little that we got to see of it where we get to witness them bounce their dialogue and emotions off each otherthor as a character shines better when he is on his own planet or pretty much any planet not named earth its like when hes on ours it nearly sucks out everything interesting about him hawkeye jeremy renner and blackwidowscarlett johansson  two completely human characters fighting alongside super powered people yea really dont get that they were wallpaper for me just like captain america when they were on screen its like they were barely registering i should not have a continuous question mark in my brain when it comes to a characterbruce bannerthe hulkmarkruffalo i have never seen the hulk movies apparently there are a fair few or the tv show my first foray into this character was in this movie he is nervous and twitchy but generally a nice person and i think ruffalo pulled that off nicelythen he turns into the hulk i didnt like the hulk hes too godlike for one thing same problem i have with thor and his kind it takes the emotional stakes out of the character if its pretty impossible for them to die he also acts like an animal also not a fan of obvious cgi characters huge green ones at that being mains and running around with actual real people its very jarring in a bad way i also dont think a fullblown movie works for him his character works better in an ensemble or even better not part of the cast at all as for the bruce part of him well we already have a genius level scientist dont really need two overall i didnt enjoy the hulk and wanted him off my screenloki tom hiddleston  the main villain who pretty much took over the movie by his first scene on down like in his coorigin movie thor he is a true scene stealer i loved watching him hiddleston is a treasure to watch act this character out if the academy wasnt such stuck ups about fantasyscifi movies i truly think he deserved an oscar for his portrayal in this and the first thor movie his acting for loki is just brillianthowever no amount of scene stealing acting is going to erase that whedon pretty much destroyed his overall character he went from a sympathetic villain in thor to a complete monster punch line in this one the tone of this movie wasnt serious enough in the first place with whedon thinking he had to make everyone be a walking comedian but i will never understand the logic of making your villain be the silliest thing in the moviesadly that is exactly what whedon did loki was a pathetic villainhe took a great character and made him into a joke the last straw though was not the constant beat downs and jokes at his expense but an encounter with one of the toward the end of the movie loki as a villain had officially went into ludicrous territory at that point however what saved him as a character for me was no matter how silly his dialogue sounded at points or how many times he kissed pavement or just how overall ridiculous he was as a villain hiddleston acted his butt off as loki i couldnt take my eyes off the character all i wish is that loki from now on stays in the thor movies and that joss whedon doesnt get to touch the character ever againin summary the movies tone was to comedic it was like whedon was writing for the next bada bing instead of great emotional character moments the dialogue was more cheesy and clich then notthe cgi looked datedthere was no real emotional punch i just didnt care if they lived or died although it wasnt like they were in any real danger of that happening in the first place since the movie overall lacked believable tensionand the villain was well acted but really pathetic as one,fantasy
the 2012first this is high energy stuff with lots of superhero fighting lots beyond that i had to pick and choose what i liked and what seemed to be dragged out a bit it was never slow but it was often a bit uninterestingthe real downside to the movie was well the plot which had yet another super huge super awful enemy that required our local team to go out and find a way to conquer it never really mattered why these bad people were coming though they do explain why with a spacey glowing cube and thors halfbrother having some childhood issues unresolved the set design however was really ambitious not only with the huge scenes and big cgi effects but the range and diversity of interiors with a deliberate variety of styles that related to the different characters and some of the actors and actresses were terrific to watch even if they didnt really have much to say or do that mattered besides save the world of courseif this sounds like im not cut out of this type of movie you are mostly wrong i have loved for example the three nolan batman movies a couple of the spiderman ones and a few oddballs here and there all of which work on some of the same principles of super villain and a modified new york gotham etc as a city of resilient victims to savesmall relevant confession i loved the iron man movies and never saw any of the other marvel character movies like the hulk in this allstar get together of a half dozen famous superheroes i naturally loved the iron man parts and was neutral on the rest mostly because robert downey jr is a huge cut above the others of the cast in presence in humor in making the whole enterprise a comic book come to life not a serious savetheworld epic by contrast the leader of the bad guys is a wan halfhearted baddie who didnt create the chills or fear the movie badly needed as a movie of characters taken from various marvel comic book and movie series it was how fully the characters were realized that made the difference mark ruffalo as the hulk was pretty great though restrained a bit the black widow in the hands of scarlett johansson was stunning to look at but also weirdly restrained except the fighting of course thor was a bore taking his old school power thing too too seriously and captain america though a likable cute guy was also a bad casting jobhe had to do more than look good unlike say gwyneth paltrow who simply had to look good since she unfortunately had nothing much to say or doyoull know if this movie is your thing before you read this or see a trailer its a boiler plate super hero action movie with lots of computer effects and a standard villain from the universe menace the computer effects like these skeletal ocean monsters swimming through manhattan wrecking lots of buildings are actually surprisingly a bit clunky once you start watching the details overall director and writer joss whedon seems a bit overwhelmed here and has cowritten a predictable bit of very expensive contemporary hollywood stuff and then directed it without quite making it special or surprising i mean even samuel l jackson is stiff and preachy the movie has its moments for sure but thats not enough disappointing,fantasy
how can this film be rated 8 imho it was absolutely average apart from robert downeys sarcasticacerbic humour the films remaining characters were hampered by a poor plot line and an inconsistentjuvenile comic book narrative thats holed below the water line by contradictions marvel need to look to writers like garth ennis to see how comics should be donecostumes were embarrassingly bad lokis plastic horns and staff captain americas camp tights and thors spandexhas the imdb score been artificially inflated is it a case of the emperors new clothes or is it marvel fanboys i dont know but it aint worth more than 5 or 6 on the imdb richter scale,fantasy
i know a lot of critics and fans loved this movie but unfortunately this movie just didnt do anything for me my first biggest problem with this movie mark ruffalo was horrible as bruce banner it was like he was sleepwalking through the entire movie marvel fired edward norton and the best replacement they could find was this guy did they just pick his name out of a hat come on my second biggest problem with this movie captain america gets pushed to the side and most of the focus is on iron man why heres a crazy idea seeing as how captain america is the leader of the why not give him the spotlight furthermore iron man and captain america hardly ever get along in this movie this wasnt at all like it was in the comics in the comics tony stark deeply admired and respected steve rogers in fact tony starks father howard helped create the captain america program my third biggest problem with this movie it takes forever for the the to come together and work as a team throughout the movie all they do is fight most of the time and occasionally throw in a corny joke can someone please tell me what purpose that serves other than to look cool if you like generic run of the mill superhero movies then give this a watch however dont expect this movie to be deep and meaningful because you will be sorely disappointed,fantasy
when i first saw the trailer for this movie i thought it looked pretty cool and when the review started coming in i immediately got excited when i finally got to see the movie i realized after the first 20 minutes that this wasnt the movie i was hoping for now let me explain whyi can start off with the script the script is not good by adding some overdramatic cheesy and boring dialogue doesnt make a movie good but the script isnt terrible some of the cheesy comments fits with the dialogue and makes you laugh a little but the one thing that is directly terrible with this movie is the story for those of you who dont know the story it goes like this thors evil brother loki has come to the earth to claim it as his and then he gets a thing called the tesseract and afters that he opens a portal so his alien army can enter the earth to take control over it but then nick fury brings together the superhero team called the to stop him i dont think its necessary for me to start explaining why the story is so terrible most people should understand why and i know a lot of people have claimed that the film dont need a good script or story because its so entertaining well i dont agree the first 1 and a half hours of the movie is really boring and i actually considered leaving the cinema but then the movie catch up with some really cool and visually stunning scenes some things in this movie was good like most of the acting the cgi and some of the dialogue but overall this is just an average popcorn movie with a superhero flick,fantasy
but i didntmaybe im getting too old 33 maybe i expected too much maybe just maybe this movie was actually rubbishi feel bad i really do who am i to hate this mega franchise i thought iron man hulk and thor were great captain america not so great but nevermind i took my wife to watch it and she hates these kind of flicks we were about half way through and i asked her do you want to stay or shall we go i cannot remember a time when i have ever asked her such a question not even for crappy flick at the end i asked her what she thought she loved it i was bemused  i actually got bored now dont get me wrong i love movies back to the future brewsters millions shawshank redemption and goodfellas are amongst my faves but this just left me underwhelmed so i ask the question again am i getting old or have i missed something,fantasy
oh my goodness i am soooo blown away that movie was perfect sound familiar of course it does everyone seems to be in love with this movie i dont know why thoughthe action was nearly flawless i will admit that it looked very real and must have been among one of the most expensive movies of all time however action is not enough to convince me to be in love with a movie whats number 1 on imdbcoms top 250 movies of all time list the shawshank redemption why is that movie so good sorry if you arent a huge fan of that movie it was good because of the story line the great acting the great cast there is not one action scene in that movie yet it is so good i feel as though people like andor love the for the opposite reason the story wasnt exactly bad or anything but i cant find anything special about itright from the very beginning boom loki just happens to appear from lord knows where i love the idea of assembling a team of super powered people super heroes to form the great i just feel like i could have predicted the entire movie i expected loki to appear wreak havoc the to assemble all of them having lots of disagreements then in the blink of an eye they would work together and beat loki in a huge battle and where will this battle take place new york how originalthe acting was good except i just cant stand loki or tom hiddleston or both i dont even know i just think he is very annoying and not even close to a good villain i find myself so unafraid of loki while guys like the joker or bane or venom scare me to death if i were ever to encounter them in real life if they were real peopleit was just very bland to me there were some very funny moments and some moments that were very good action scenes doesnt mean i give this movie a 10 it doesnt deserve like other people the fact that it is somewhere along the lines of an 82 just disappoints me big time i wouldve expected like a 7578 i dont think it deserves a spot among the top 250i do like this movie you can see i gave it 7 stars as i said the acting cast and action is very good but that doesnt mean the story line predictability or the main villain is any good at allall i can say is ive seen better hero movies,fantasy
this clich drivel extravaganza was more than painful to sit through also the explosions were too loud i had to occasionally turn the volume up when i cant hear them speaking and then booom my ears bleed i cant quite put my finger on why the presentation looks retarded and circus like hell just look at captain americas suit or the archer as he awkwardly cocks his crossbow open like a dumbassthe special effects delivered as expected but thats all there was no sensible plot they came up with nothing and crammed all the characters to prance around for a pageant showthe director of toy story in my opinion was misplaced he just didnt fit the style at all i waited for the blu ray release then disappointed,fantasy
will star this short review by saying i hate superheroes movies i hated captain america movie i dislike thor movie which was for me average so you can pretty much imagine my negative vibe about seeing this one but after so much good reviews and superhigh score i said what the hell if i did saw iron man and was mildly interesting this one should be toohow could i be so wrong about this the director joss whedon show me what prejudice towards a movie is and sure i am that i felt slap in the face like hult teaching me how to tennisthe movie is awesome there is no other point or way to express it every character in this movie excels from thor to captain america to the assassins and stark each and everyone excels with very good narrative incredible action scenes involving each and everyone of them and glorious scenes one after the othereven humor works incredible well through the whole movie there is no denying this the director the staff the actors they show a deep connection to this project they all have great chemistry and this shows in a movie that is brilliant each step of the waystarkiron man is one the the most shown on screen and i totally loved it they all have their proper time on screen in fact i can hardly understand how a movie of this magnitude with so much going on and so much things that could failed didntits no wonder hollywood is thrilled by its success i really hope this new gem of a movie is not used to try and imitate the formula without the magic this one has because make no mistake behind all this special effects shiny images action scenes and interactions what stand about the most on this movie is the chemistry between all the heroes even the villain there is no denyingfrom a guy who hate superheroes movies i give this movie a perfect 10 this is no joke this movie is the best blockbuster of this year totally recommended even for the wife who hates explosions and the kids will love itpd please watch the whole ending even after the credits that last 2 minutes are priceles,fantasy
when i went to the theaters to see this movie i was really excited ive wanted in 6 months for it to have its release what i had seen in trailers was something of the best i had seen in movie effects way and when the movie was finished and i walked out of the theaters it was the same thing maybe the movie with the best effects ever but i wasnt really pleased with what i had seen the actors are good the story is okay and the effects are exploding of course but its not what i want the to be really i mean of course you break all the records with that actors and that trailers but thats just a question about money its an actioncomedy and when 9year old kids around me laughs their heads off every other minute its not really that feeling you want to have when you watch a superhero movie the whole movie has received very good critics though its only the visual effects that deserves it im one of the few people who didnt add this to their alltimefavorite list but actually the movie doesnt have much more then an amazing visual effects job that does the movie pretty entertaining thats what i think 7 of 10 isnt bad but with harder work on the story it could be a 910,fantasy
i admit its been a while since i have seen this film but i have yet to give a proper review hopefully this review can trigger the awesome feelings you had when watching thethis is what the marvel movies have been leading up to that is every marvel movie excluding the spiderman trilogy the amount of hype behind this movie was tremendous while waiting in line for the the usher at the theater tells us that this is the best movie i have seen in 5 years that being said its extremely hard to go into this film without any expectationsso the question then is was the good if i can i would call it marvelouslets start with what i really enjoyed the two strongest parts of the are the beginning and the end when the film opens we get to see the heros in their respective environments and the opening scene with black widow stands out as one of the best after loki threatens earth the team has to assemble watching the team finally come together after waiting so many years is a special moment now the end was good because we finally get to see the work together as a team while it took the entire movie for the marvel heros to figure out that they are stronger as a unit than as individuals its worth the wait how the camera panned across each hero who was doing something that effected the next person was stunning to me this felt the most like an actual comic book of video gamethe humor and writing really stand out as good i found myself laughing a lot more than i thought at this movie and that works for this film the marvel movies have always been bright and very light hearted at times and the script really made that aspect shine throughthe two sides of the hulk the hulk was one of the best parts of this movie along with the relationship between captain america and iron man i hope they set up the civil war story however if i had one flaw with the it would be mark ruffalo as bruce banner  honestly i thought both previous actors bana and norton played the part betteri know there is a ton more content to this film but i should save that for when i get the film again on blu ray and have a fresh viewingoverall the is a superhero film done right everything just seemed to mesh and fall right into place however i am not giving it a 10 just yet because the dark knight rises is coming out soon and i believe that it will be better than the90out of 10better clench up legolas,fantasy
the most recent marvel comics film efforts have had several things in common  excellent casting just spot on casting great characters developed for years through the marvel comics good dialogue but often muddled andor derivative plots and usually overlong for example spiderman 3 had chunks of useless segments and a plot shamelessly recycled from earlier spiderman movies interspersed with some gorgeous moments of action this one is interesting it wouldnt have been as effective without all the introductory movies for many of the characters including captain america iron man and thor which actually set the table for this main course the collection of heroes make this movie greater than the sum of the individual works it just fits like a glove there are so many good performances  evans is good again as capt a downey has made iron man his own and hes got most of the best lines ruffalo is amazing as the hulk johannson is solid as the widow jackson and gregg fit as nick fury and his top agent and just maybe renner trumps them all as the unflappable hawkeye i saw this with my youngest in 3d the next night i went back with both my kids and saw it again in 3d and enjoyed it just as much hiddleston does an admirable jaye davidsonesque turn as the bad guy with some help from an otherworldly invasion force the cgi stuff works interspersed with some eyeopening live action the best moment comes when the camera does a slow 360 degree circuit of the circling the wagons in nyc theres a lot going on here and there still is some fat mixed in with the meat but as a whole this thing just works grandly very highly recommended,fantasy
i wish i could rate this movie 100 out of 100 i have seen this movie twice in the theaters and its amazing it made me yell because the action was amazing and it made me burst out laughing in several parts lets just say i was very vocal during this movie the acting is so perfect and the plot was also amazing the action was unbelievable and the effects were outstanding i love this movie and have high respect for everyone involved in the making the incredible hulk was portrayed exactly as he should be just pure rage and outbursts of anger the iron man was super funny and really cool too as always captain america isnt my favorite hes kind of lame hawkeye is also very cool but i wish he had an actual superpower like agility or something black widow is awesome but she wasnt used to her fullest abilities in this movie thor is also very cool but should have been used a little more in this movie i wish thor would have taken down one of the huge monster things on his own hes fully capable of it all in all this movie is a mustsee amazing movie,fantasy
first of allwow i saw it in imax 3d and it was just amazing the story the acting the tension the character relationships comic relief flawless just a work of art i personally think that all of the marvel movies in the last decade have been great movies directed by true comic fans all leading up to this one moment in cinema history and they did not let us down its so ironic that most of the modern action movies are so far fetched fake pop hype served with sex and a big dose of lets come up with a really crazy story to top last years blockbuster it gets old this movie somehow has a sense of honesty and realism no doubt superhero magic but the story and connection with the previous individual hero films just made it all come together in a way that makes you feel like youre watching a great flashback of ancient mythos unfold just plain fun,fantasy
only one man in hollywood that i could think of could take six superheroes and knit them together so seamlessly giving them each a feeling of value to the team have such a clever script and get the action sequences to such an exciting level whedon after decades of hard work in television has finally ascended from cult status and entered the big time with the highest grossing film of all time and an easy contender for one of the best movies in the genre of all time if not certainly the most entertainingi went in with very high expectations expecting to enjoy it but fearing that the film would be a bit beyond josss ability to make great an ensemble cast of 8 main characters and it being the most anticipated film of the last 5 years with the studio breathing down the filmmakers necks thats a tough job description i figured it couldnt get better than 710 but i shouldve known not to doubt whedonmany will say that this film seems slow paced but those are people who just want a popcorn flick with minimal character development and dialog that said if you pay attention to the dialog this film manages to draw emotions from the audience which is rare for a blockbuster type film the film also manages to keep those scenes succinct enough to keep the audience from lulling this film was made for the big screen and was easily the most fun ive had at the theaters in my 28 yearsif you are a fan of the comics you will love how the characters all have their complex attributes displayed and how all their strengths combine to form a team you think how will captain america hawkeye or black widow be of any use when iron man hulk and thor are out wrecking sht but there they are adding a dynamic to the team that would sorely needed in their absence captain is a born leader black widow is manipulative and cunning hawkeye is incredibly reliable support iron man and thor wreck sht fury is the soul of the team and hulk smashes the movie spends a lot of time setting things up but does it so efficiently that you never really find yourself getting tired of all the exposition as the story moves along the humor in the script shines the acting is solid across the board with exceptional work by downey who provides much needed lightness and ruffalo who absolutely nailed bruce banner in a way that wasnt whiny and pathetic like banas or nortons the ending is as somber as it is victorious and whedon sets things up for what i hope is a much darker and more introspective sequelwhile certainly not the greatest film of all time for the genre it couldnt get any better in my opinion a movie like this is why big theaters exist and if you wait until it comes out on dvd youll be missing out,fantasy
in the days leading up to the release i was so excited that i could barely contain myself my girlfriend warned me not to get too excited or i would be left disappointed from my own high expectations of it it was good advice but i simply couldnt help myself going into the cinema my expectations were as high as they had ever been for a movie and yet still i was blown away from start to finish i was rooted to my seat with my eyes fixed to the screen with fantastic visuals incredible fight scenes and even some witty humor thrown in some may think this weird but it fits in beautifully the plot itself is not complex but is interesting and does the name justicestill i think what made this movie so great is the movies that came before it as soon as the movie starts you already have these characters you know deep characters each with their own storyline it means that the can dive straight in and take you a rollercoaster of a ride both those who already know the from the comics and those who dont will enjoy this,fantasy
i have rarely laughed out loud over a movie but this one had me belly laughing and giggling all the way through i loved how this movie brought most of the beloved super heros together and how they played off each other i gave it a 10  10 because of the pure enjoyment of the film usually when i sit through a movie i am mentally counting the minutes when i can get up and go but this one i wanted to last longer i am so hoping they come up with a 2nd movie just as good if you like super hero movies and love a good laugh go see this movie it is well worth the time i can not wait until the dvd comes out it will be a sure buy for me,fantasy
i watched marvels at the cinema in 2d i was amazed  excitedthe cast special effects plot action sequence are way beyond my expectationsthe hulk played by mark raffalow is fantastic the looks very realistic comparing with the other previous hulk movies of course i dont have anything wrong to say about this movie all other characters have done a very good job lokis appearance is very well done by showing his cunning attitudes villain looking face my god i love him acting like that better than the appearance in the movie thor some reviews say the the movie has to experience in 2d but i am not going to take a change i will watch this in 3d too but i hope that 2d is better than 3d thoughall i have to say is wow assemble 1010,fantasy
just got back from watching this movie this was a very entertaining movie there are a lot of spots in the movie that refer to other superhero movies before the hero even comes into play i love the fact that if you were able to watch all these movies the movie ties it all together people i highly recommend that you watch both iron man movies captain america and thor before you watch this it makes it much more enjoyable you can still watch it without watching them it will just make much more enjoyable also i feel this movie was well balanced and engaging hulk and stark had me laughing not stop action from start to finish,fantasy
im not the biggest fan of the setup movies for the i think theyre tremendously hit and miss and not through some comic book fan need for accuracy but as stand alone films on their own merits see i like the odd comic book but im certainly not a comic book fan what i am a fan of is good solid storytelling you know  characters that evolve logically sound motivations and tensions good pacing an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck  that sort of thing from this perspective the setup movies fell mostly flat for me iron man was fabulous fun but its sequel was poor the hulk was meh captain america spent far too long without any actual captain america in it and thor  hmmm was just a bit of an all round mess and lacked even eye candy set pieces to elevate it so back a few years ago when it first became whispered in nerd circles that the was going to surface to tie all these movies together i didnt really get much of a sense of excitement a few years later as the end credits rolled on thor i pretty much made up my mind that the movie was going to screw up badly if the industry couldnt pull off a good movie with just one hero in it how could they ever pull off one with sixthen i heard that joss whedon was writing and directing and my interest rekindled after all ive seen him handle symphonies of characters before  with the scooby gang and the serenity crew if anyone could do it whedon couldbut still i was wary just didnt want to let my expectations get too high  superhero movies are notoriously difficult to get right after all maybe even whedon would screw it upboy was i wrongi dont think ive had this much fun at the cinema in years since the first matrix movie in fact which was what twelve years ago god im old the had everything a good popcorn flick needs  major action setpieces beautiful sfx some neat and effective humor yada yada yada but none of that is what left my jaw on the floor what really blew me away  and what compelled me to come here and write the first review ive done on imdb in quite some time years probably  was just how perfectly done the script was every character is given their moment to shine every interaction is perfectly in tune this whole movie was the audiovisual equivalent of listening to a perfectly wrought symphony every moving part clicked into place so well that you couldnt have taken out one single character  not even the arguably second tier characters of hawkeye and the black widow  without the whole thing coming apart this is no batman or pirates of the caribbean or spider man movie because while those multiprotagonist movies were all quite adequate and entertaining the characters and plots were often an out of focus mess not so in the everything clicks so perfectly i cant even find the words to describe it youll just have to go see it for yourself to see what i mean,fantasy
i am a fan of the recent marvel superhero movies spiderman iron man the hulk thor and especially captain america the is better than all of those all of the heroes in the get a moment to shine on screen even nick fury going into the movie i was a little disappointed to know that loki was going to be the main protagonist but after seeing the film i can see why this was the case the ties a lot of the previous movies together and having thors brother as the bad guy made that more efficient its a long movie but when it was over i didnt feel beat up and ready for the story to be over the way i do when trying to watch an entire harry potter movie even the lord of the rings movies seems too long to me but thanks to a great story and even better dialog i never became impatient during thethe standout from the is clearly the hulk you spend most of the movie waiting for him to appear and its amazing when he finally goes on a rampage at two points during the movie the hulk actually got applause from the audiencehighly recommended i cant wait to see it again lets hope the 2 is half as good,fantasy
please if you havent watched it yet dont read my review or any other review just go and see itif you are not into marvel movies if you havent watched every other previous installment of the you wont find this movie very appealing to you but if you have watched every previous movie if you like the characters then prepare yourself because joss whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by manthats the thing about this movie its not really a movie on its own i mean it expects you to know the characters and thats just what it has to be this is not really a movie but a cinematic experience if the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody flirting with that somebody foreplay the is sex thats the best way i can put ityou can really fell that whedon knows and loves this characters because he takes the core elements of each of the personalities and uses them for building the problems the humor the companionship i have to say this is the best team assembly i have seen this movie has the best humor the best action the best acting the best characterization the best everythingfor the first time i felt a nerdgasm im not lying or exaggerating i felt itany person who criticizes this movie did not get it at all did not get the point of it because the will change cinema forever i mean iti love good movies i do i know a lot of movies and im not a person that watches only hollywood movies but i can say this the is one of the best experiences i have ever had in my whole life i will see it at least 3 times more,fantasy
this many reviews cant be wrong and now im part of that group i wont spoil it with much details but the script is good the directing is great and the action is just amazing the biggest surprise for me was mark ruffalos part i was highly skeptical because of his look and the hulks but after seeing the entire movie i have to agree that he is the best hulk version thus far i am simply amaze at both weldon and marks work just wowthe are two disappointing things for me though first is hawkeye hes only smiles once in the movie and i bet youll have a hard time finding that part this is because ive grew up knowing hawkeye more as a comedicserious character and not just a pure serious character that doesnt mean his part in the movie wasnt great second is banner just showing up and agreeing to fight alongside the team sure one can make guesses but i much prefer that one was provided either as hulk wanting to protect others as he usually does or as banner and hulk agreeing that he needs to help out so that others see him differently and accept him but even this is overshadowed immediately by the next 10s after he arrives that was just jaw dropping for me and the avenger teammates lol i have to suggest to those that havent already watched the movie to pay close attention to the dialogs many of the lower reviews especially from film critics is because they really dont pay attention to the dialogs and rate it down plus youll see why i enjoyed the hulk immensely in this moviemany people are turned off on the fact that it is an alien invasion scene even the socalled hardcore comic fans i will have to remind everyone here that for most comic superheroes the big world killer scenarios are from outer space from aliens it doesnt matter if its dc or marvel its exact same situation its not a copy of transformers 3 since michael bay made up the story in the first place and did a poor job at it transformers 3 is a copy of what comic books have been using for agesdont be surprise but eventually superman will have doomsday and his portals green lantern is guardian of the universe dont see how one gets upset at an alien force coming in to destroy earth or any other planet that is in their area of protection batman and the justice league will have their aliens and so forth really what are you complaining about then that there are too much aliens how are you going to introduce them then and still remain true to the story thats what i thought mindless comic book fans that think they know betterpffftif youre happy with just the superhero fighting human villains on and from earth fine stay that way but dont go bitching because eventually the story of all superheroes will involve aliens youre precious batman will involve aliens its just not there in the form of movies yet joker has a big part in aliens and earths destruction get with it peopleas for people complaining about the lack of character development well the answer is simple go and watch the respective movies about the super hero you are disappointed about there are two iron movies 2 hulks one captain america one thor and while black window and hawkeye dont have their own movie yet they did have a little history in the movie about them they are the less popular heroes of the team thats why so again why are people even complaining about this issue in the first placeseriously though i sometimes think people are just too anal to think clearly even hardcore fans,fantasy
i am a huge marvel geek so if you are not 100 into marvel or superhero movies you should take the following with a grain of salt is everything i ever dreamed of and lived for it is like i was a child again watching in awe with my mouth wide openwhedon nailed nearly every single scene he made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated this movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots i have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if i wanted to describe my feelings and after seeing the trailer and the pictures i already had high expectationsthe charisma of captain america the wild brutality of the hulk the majesty of thor it was all there i was never the biggest fan of but right now after writing these lines i am going to read up some avenger comic books from my collection and we have 2 amthis is how you spend 200 million on a movie,fantasy
just came back from watching the awesome  epic cool outstanding fantastic etc looks like for almost the whole year of me waiting to watch movie and all the hype that they built up was worth the waittom hiddleston as loki is as evil as ever but it would have been great if more villains had shown up along the way jeremy renner as clint bartonhawkeye was the surprising character for me since i never expected him to turn evil but he was definitely the right man chosen for the role scarlett johansson was beautifully stunning as natasha romanoffblack widow thor was great and surprisingly gave the hulk a run for his money something which i didnt quite expect to see speaking of hulk mark ruffalo was well suited to play bruce bannerhulk although norton was better in my opinion cobie smulders as maria hills was a bit of a let down since i expected more screen time for her samuel l jackson was ok as nick fury robert downey jr is as goofy as ever as tony starkiron man but for me the biggest driving force of the entire movie has got to none other than chris evans awesome acting as steve rogerscaptain america he was in my opinion the biggest star of the film in my opinion and really made the team come together as one the plot was very simple and straightforward but the action scenes and dram was what made the movie really interesting who says that the movie needs to have a good storyline in order for the film to be great the movie itself doesnt necessary require story background for the characters at all since they were all already told in their own separate movies respectivelyon a note to those who have been complaining on the film for being mindless boring etc my question is what did you expect from a superhero movie this movie is all about action and it was made to be entertaining and fun to watch not for you to sit and expect a twisty kind of turn story like tdk the main reason why people go watch is because they wanted to see their favorite main heroes from different franchise team up together in the same movie thats all that is and to me that isnt a bad thing at alli have a degree in film and video majoring animation if youre wondering but i still find this movie really good if you guys are looking for something else beyond action in this film then you guys are in the wrong place all in all an epic film which definitely deserves to be ranked in the imdb top 100 movie list and definitely above tdk this is one movie which i will surely go and see againon a final note  kudos to joss whedon and the entire crew for making an awesome superhero film cant wait for the 2,fantasy

the mere idea of bringing all the superheroes together made this movie a hit it was epic indeed it totally lives up to your expectations some scenes in this movie are unexpectedly hilarious everyone in the cast did a great job mark ruffalo was a excellent replacement for edward norton everyone was disappointed by hulks character not being played by edward including me but id say mark was up to the mark if youre looking for a break from your dailyroutine stressed life go to the theaters and watch this movie the has all the ingredients needed for a hit movie thor  stark  hulk  captain america  epic,fantasy
the anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of the heroes that comprise this superstar group  iron man hulk thor and finally captain america these individual films were all very good on their own so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure even though i am out of town now that did not stop me from catching this film with some marvel comics geeks and for once a film has come that fulfills its advanced hype and then somethe film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by nick fury of shield to retrieve a blue highenergy cube called the tesseract stolen by the asgard god loki it was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes and they did not really get along with each other right away as would be expected there is humor along with the highintensity action i felt though that some funny scenes involving tony stark were too self indulgent for comfort in a team film like thisit was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time even the lesser known ones like the superarcher hawkeye the very busy jeremy renner and the amazing fighter black widow stunningly portrayed by the beautiful scarlett johansson the others played their characters as they did in their solo movies and amazingly they all worked so well together here the imperious thor by chris hemsworth the patriotic captain america by chris evans and the haughty tony stark  iron man by robert downey jr people doubted if marc ruffalo could take ed nortons place as dr bruce banner and the hulk but ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations the hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd even the everloyal agent coulsen clark gregg gets his moment to shinethis film is a definite mustsee not only for all fans of marvel comics but for fans of actionfantasy films in general this is real triumph for director josh whedon dont miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited,fantasy
i have to say this film was brilliant from start to finish the characters were awesome and the action was mind blowing i thoroughly recommend this film it captured the true meaning of an epic feature and this certainly delivers a punch the hulk looked great in all his glory and i hope he gets to appear in the next instalment a great mix of action from the air battles to the streets below it was great seeing thor and hulk battle it out again being the last time we saw them together was in tihr tv movie from 1988i think it was faithful to the comics and brought the comic strip to life and i can only applaud the efforts of the film crew for bringing together the characters that i grew up and became so fond of,fantasy
ok i know 1010 scores are thrown in too lightly n ow a days but hear me out this movie is truly astonishing following the storyline directly from thor 2011 this movie starts strong with loki trying to conquer earth from there its just a wild ride it grips on you and you wont be able to catch your breath until way after the creditsthe thing that i appreciate the most is that its a true superhero movie often in comics adaptations the directors try to ground the actions and powers worried they can not match the scope of the comic book medium well not here the action is unbelievable the feats of strength breathtaking ironman shoots its repulsor beams thor uses his lightning strikelastly it wouldnt have worked without the humor wheedon has perfect chops each time his punchlines will take you off guard and trust me laugh you willi watched this in a really packed theater the function was sold out one week before a record in my country everyone was cheering laughing clapping and wowing a truly special spectaclereally fing amazing,fantasy
yep ill be honest i did cringe a little when i found out joss whedon was directing i absolutely love his work but i just could not see how his talents would be able to be used to make this sort of film i am so happy to say that i was wrong the film allows you to enjoy every moment as it passes especially when at the end you realised youve just sat through 2 hours and 20 minutes of concentrationlike you expect were all reintroduced to all the characters one by one off doing their own thing and shield trying to bring them all together the good thing about this is when they do all eventually start to get together you get the all too normal tension between a group of individuals being almost forced together with the expectations from shield that they automatically work together as some fantastic team aside from all the action scenes explosions fights etc etc you still get the storyline the whole time if you step back and look at the whole storyline you realise that its a pretty semitypical script but the whole film you dont even realise thats happening it really brings comic films to a new meaning the biggest adjustment for myself and im sure many other viewers was the role of tony stark iron man though downey jr reprised the role fantastically no surprise both iron man films had kept to the human story lines the introduced the film character into the world of science fiction with the iron man films you could keep some sort of natural relationship with the storyline and characters because all was somewhat believable in the action movie sense but with saying that as you watch the movie and you make your own adjustments to this so is stark himself so it ties in perfectly with the audience which is another hats off moment for whedonanother fantastic thing and is one of the defining points of this film is the comedic input almost every comic film is known as being all action and drama you feel like you have to be serious the whole time ofcourse minor funny moments but nothing good joss whedon has taken account the audience and the 21st century and made some key scenes in the film so much better and less awkward it had the entire cinema erupt in laughter though with saying that and you reading it might make you stand offish the way its worked into the scene it would be just as impressive even if it was just kept to a dramatic scenethis film had chance of being really well made or an absolute laughable flop it has impressed me and it has impressed many many other people i look forward to hearing further reviews as it opens in cinemas around the world the writers directors producers and the cast have all worked together amazingly and i cannot wait for future projects,fantasy
with the high budget this film had i should not be noticing the staging ok mark you stand there and look annoyed but knowing scarlett look like youre pondering chris focus on keeping some of the accent but not all of it     there was no scene in the film where i didnt see with my minds eye the director on set barking stage direction perhaps if the script had been stronger i wouldnt have noticed but pair a weak script with a long series of obviously staged and very nondynamic scenes and you end up with more flat scenes than i can count character development with this cadre of fun and interesting actors and the huge budget that hired them youd think youd end up with quality oozing out of the screen no robert downeys stark was one note snarkie and thats it a few fun lines but zero cleverness and no depth the same with the rest of them except for mark r and scarlet j they were the only two who created anything interesting with their parts  and of these two mark r created a genuinely interesting character in banner cgi big budgets mean you shouldnt notice the cgi in one scene in particular it was obvious that the actors were in front of a green screen with the cgi added later they should blend into the cgi not stand apart and obviously in front of it script could the script have been more plodding and obvious it was not a smart or clever script it read like    a comic book perhaps thats all marvel can do well,fantasy
was not impressed wouldnt go as far to say it was as bad as transformers 2 and 3 but it was aiming to bestory wise it was a piece of crap typical good vs bad acting not so good the only thing that was protecting these flaws was the special effects buildings fell things blew up blah blah blah the end of the movie was meant to be epic but it was very underwhelming i was thinking that this was meant to be an advanced alien race i also thought that cpt america was meant to be a badass but it turns out he wears pyjamas not chainmailit was memorable only because it was so disappointing,fantasy
i hate this movie there i said it i watched it in theaters and came out mildly entertained but disappointed and i rewatched it again recently only to hate it this is a poorly written mess whose awful writing has somehow gone unnoticed by everyone i know to all those people who havent seen this movie yet let me spare you the trouble marvels the sucks for starters out of the five movies made before this i only saw three of them and of those three only one was actually good iron man iron man 2 was a boring mess and thor was more of the same only with natalie portman so that made it worse the takes all these superheroes most of which i never heard of and throws them all together for the first time in cinematic history an impressive feat but if the harry potter movies were any indication just because its an interesting idea doesnt always mean it is good usually it means its total c the good the actors look the roles whoever cast chris hemsworth as thor deserves a raise because he looks perfect robert downey jr looks like tony stark chris evans is captain america and so on and so on the acting isnt all memorable with downey just doing what he does in every single movie he is in ie play the annoying guy zodiac great movie by the way kiss kiss bang bang another fun movie and the iron man films there is not one character who could not be swapped out for another and make any difference the bad basically everything else joss whedon in my opinion is a straight up hack never mind the fact that he wrote the godawful alien resurrection but in this movie his writing is just lazy so many things that make no sense happen and the feeling i get is that those are things that i should overlook because its a comic book movie no why can a shield developed in the 1940s withstand the full force of a norse god if this stuff was so lightweight and powerful why didnt iron man make his suit out of it why does loki want to take over the world when in thor he explicitly stated he never wanted power there are so many other things that make no sense but this reviews got to end sometime the final battle in this mess takes place in new york and it is the most boring least engaging battle since the battle of chicago in transformers dark of the moon yes this movie is on par with transformers none of the characters are likable none of the action scenes are thrilling the humor comes of as cheap and fails lokis army is the most useless army out there etc etc this movie is a disaster a titanic failure of a film not just because its a boring horribly written piece of s but because to me it represents marvels laziness they know their films make lots of money so they keep cranking out one awful movie after another first it was iron man 2 then it was thor now it was the and not deciding to wait a year they released the awful amazing spiderman these guys take less time to wait for their next product than activision does with call of duty with the announcement of the 2 spiderman 2 thor 2 iron man 3 captain america 2 and probably hulk 2 i gotta ask when does this end when will marvel finally just kill their entire business and stop making awful movies or at the very least dont hire joss whedon side note no i am not a dc fanboy writing this scathing review simply because it is a marvel film i am writing this because i truly detested this film the fact that is just so happens to be marvel is a coincidence,fantasy
okay where do i beginaction this movie has really good action sequences and its the strongest point in this filmstory this movie is rated so highly they made it seem like it had an out of the box story line and something more but its not is the storyline bad no its too simple and doesnt deserve all the praise its getting i felt i was watching transformers 3 again at the final battle with the aliens there is nothing special with the plot at all there was barely any depth and its forgettable a mind controlled good guy on the enemy team how many times have we heard that before this movie needs something else in the plot that will differentiate it from the otherswriting writing was decent but it there were a lot of cheesy lines want some nachos with that i didnt like how the dealt with the death of agent coulson just wasnt right and he could have gone out better there were way too many coincidences how does bruce banner get to where they were with a bike that goes 10 miles per hour acting it was either decent or below again with the over praise it is making it seem like the acting is top notch or something and it isntother stuff i think when they do a sequel they need to improve the story the plot the writing and actually make the score of the movie good and memorable because some people dont realize how important a score can be in movies it adds a lot to them this movie should not be in the top 250 to be fair it needs to be a 7678 on the imdb scale when they do the 2 its not going to be very hard to top this one if they improve on the things i mentioned,fantasy
i was waiting for this movie for a long timethe movie was above my expectationi am very happy with the response in its opening dayironman is my favorite super herorobert d jr is a very talented actoreverybody knows about itbut rest of the super heroes specially hulk n thor are also goodstory line is goodthe effects are awesomedont download pirated version because these guys works really hard to please viewers like usthis action packed movie is a complete family entertainerhumoractionjaw breaking effectsawesome moviein short if you miss this movie now then you are going to regret about it laterwatch it and rate it on imdb,fantasy
no doubt the best movie of the year you wont be disappointed with this movies first its the for good sake the earths mightiest super heroes therefore this is going to be big second the casts the starstudded cast is undeniably just the best third the director so good i wish hell have more movies to direct now that he prove his skill in this movie fourth the fans the fans are just dying not to watch this brilliant movie fifth when will be the sequel and more reasons this movie is going to be great the movie itself is very good there isnt any dull moment to get bored if it isnt fight scenes it somewhat funny scenes or awesome scene of our heroes the characters of this movie are very great i love tony stark bruce banner steve rogers thor natasha romanoff clint barton and agent coulson i want a sequel soon please,fantasy
ladies and gentlemen we have a winner most superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness even overemphasizing it troubled brooding characters black leather and anger rule the day here the mix everything so well it leans to the dark but touches on fun and the interaction of every character just enough maybe its the fact that all the lead characters got their chance to be introduced in their own movies or maybe its because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable its truly better than any other comicbook based movie that i have ever seen i say that not to egg on fans of other properties because i am a fan of other properties because of the groundwork that has come before and because of the high level that this film operates it is bigger than any have ever delivered all the dramatic beats really click besides the depth and action pieces so much of the humor works because it is so well written the writing displays true character establishment and development over the course of the film but never gets bogged down by the shear number of characters whats also rare for any summer movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight this is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material they make it shine and give you a remarkable movie that people will be talking about for years to come the tv clips seen leading up to the movie tease at the action but there is so much they saved for the actual running i cant thank them enough for that factor they knew they had a hit on their hands so why spoil the word of mouth if you liked the trailers and tv stuff you havent seen anything yet that in and of itself was a pleasant surprise is a complete and very well done movie and as much fun as ive ever had in the cinema thats no lie or no joke,fantasy
the best superhero movie nuff said highly recommended movie for everyone go watch it you will not regret it the action the jokes the script the special effects the story the characters the actorsactresses especially scarlett johansson shes so hot and gorgeous are perfect one of the best movies of 2012 my expectations for this movie was exceeded i will certainly watch the sequel of this movie to see black widow again  i cant believe 2 hrs and 20 mins passed do fast i did not get bored on this movie at all cause i was so into this movie cause its so fantastic i will see this movie againperfect for me 1010,fantasy
i deliberately avoided seeing any trailers or pictures or anything that might have reduced the impact of the but i dont think it would have made any difference simply put joss whedon has succeeded where so many others have failed in the past most notably dc comicsto bring comic book characters to the real world and the big screenwithout alienating the fans or confusing the newbies and seemingly the hardest task to make it a good movie an indication of how he has succeeded is my poor 11 year old daughter who gets dragged to all the iron man green lantern etc movies with me and her brothers and she suffers through them quietly mostly however after leaving the she declared it her favourite movie ever i cant comment on how you would enjoy this movie without the back story contained in the previous marvel characters movies but i think that pretty much everyone alive today has some knowledge of who iron man the hulk and captain america are you should be able to work the rest out from there i saw it in 3d and it was good but i wouldnt say the 3d is a must but i would say see it on the big screen and see it as soon as you can,fantasy
a couple of chuckles from the one liners action scenes that went on too long and a predictable and inevitable ending it was okay and easy watching to pass a friday evening just dont expect too much from it  challenging and a fine work of art it isnt a bit of fun it is hiddleston made a fine villain and the other characters performed as expectedie not everyone is going to get an oscar for best actor no matter how many films they make some of the hook and line dialogue was spoken as if they were bored perhaps they were cgi is well cgi they worst aspect of this film though is the title if you were expecting steed and emma peel or purdey and gambit then you are going to be very disappointed,fantasy
it is the first movie in which we will see several superheroes fighting together against evil forces who attacked earthit feels good when you see several marvel superheroes together on one screenthe film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them togetherrobert downey jr is best in the role of iron manother actors have also done a good jobthis movie contains amazing visual effectsstory is simple but movie contains great fight scenes and actionthis movie cannot be missed by marvel fansoverallthe is an amazing movie which creates a new benchmark in hollywood i will give this movie 910,fantasy
this movie is frankly excellent watching it for the first time up until the fifth time which for me was after winter soldier came out was very very thrilling to had a plot first of all one that might not show itself well the first time around but is there nonetheless no character doesnt need to be present and no character is out of place stark is there because of his fathers affiliations with the tesseractgoingson and later his new tower becomes the location of lokis spacebridgemachine because of his new energy that he created in iron man 2 cap is there because well the tesseract is the subject of the films conflict he is neither cannon fodder nor useless  sure his action sequences in this movie arent outstanding like they are amazingly in caws but since that movie existed afterwards it doesnt matter thor is there because his brother is the antagonist he in fact has more reason to be in the circle of protagonists more than the other banner is present because he was needed to locate the tesseract when it was stolen plain and simple barton because well he was a shield agent at the first facility we see overtaken by lokis scepter then et cetera and romanoff because well shes a major shield agent who is an elite fighter as well as the only female of the teamas for the biggest plotcomplaints i have seen the reason loki wanted to be captured on the helicarrier is so that he could disturb the harmony of the team and set off hulk knowing also that with his teleporttrick hed be able to lure thor and escape and lastly the reason banner in new york after arriving by motorcycle is able to immediately turn into the hulk is because of the ability that is evident at the very end of incredible hulk him being able to voluntarily become angry no single avenger dominates the plot this movie has clever transitions when each avenger is first seen has no exmachinas no overabundance of jokes absolutely no lack of clever lines and dialogue i refer mainly to loki w fury no lack of sixvsaliens action great acting and a sensible ending whedons directiondirecting of this film is more than meh pretty good  and this movie was only overrated when its fanhype was still alive it doesnt become more mediocre of a film once more thrilling mcu installments have come out,fantasy
i just cant believe this movie has a rating of over 8 stars on imdb it consists of every clich you can imagine and there is absolutely nothing that could recommend it for more than a superhero movie i actually fell asleep in the cinema and when i woke up after 23rds of the movie i was not surprised to find that i hadnt missed anything the plot unfolded as expected i didnt fall asleep because i was tired but because everything in this movie is so unbelievably boring the acting is below average and all characters except iron man portrayed by robert downey junior are as dull as you can get it was a total waste of time and money,fantasy
my kids 10 and 7 liked it although they got fidgety during some of the long over drawn out conversation sequences i thought it was pretty dumb i grew up with comic books and still read them but all these live action films just fall flat first of captain americas costume is ridiculous looks like something from the movies of 20 years ago cheap materials galore im really surprised to see so many favorable reviews of this movie the comic lines in the film mostly by tony stark are the cheeziest bunch of dad jokes ive heard the action scenes are good for the most part but again in todays society someone dressed up like captain america would look like a raving lunatic,fantasy
movie is only and only for ages between 616 anyone with any expectation from cinema should skip this one a movie for video game addcits no clear plot everything is foreseeable nothing new just piled on to make a difference too much of mediocre ends up creating something less then mediocre pity the time and the money i spent on this usual hollywood garbage i think people should wait for it to come on tv not even worth the dvd or bluray everyone here with a positive comment has a fantasy world where super heros are logical if the movie was shorter maybe i could let myself go but it is tooooo long brother telling you skip this one and thank me later,fantasy
i just saw the movie i have been a comic reader and a movie goer for more than twenty years now and a film like this should have been my wet dream instead what i saw was a hollow empty attempt to recreate the magic of the original comic book an attempt that poorly fails in a miserable way despite or i should say thanks to all the special effects and the star power the producers have tried to throw in the fantasy the wit the ideas that were present in the comic and that made it the dreams and the joy of so many kids were completely absent in this studio behemoth i will admit that the recreation of such magic was a difficult task probably doomed from the beginning but this thing is completely lacking brain or direction or any meaning at all the script is a total and utter disaster full of bore and incredibly shallow and it goes just ridiculous every time it tries to go funny with sketches and jokes all very similar between themselves i will rate the movie 2 stars just to give it credit for having been able to give us the first decent bannerhulk it took only three attempts to the hollywood writers  and god knows how many millions of dollars wasted movies like are unlucky children that inherit only all the defects from both the parents which in this case would be mr mainstream comics and mrs movie industry this leaves them with basically no audience they are too much gruesome and boring for kids too much childish for youngsters while for the adults  at least for those the grownup ones  there are just too many capes the same stories printed on comic pages still resonate in popular culture after decades but this movie will be hopefully forgotten as soon as the media battage slow down,fantasy
went to this movie with high expectations but after being bored for basically 23 of the movie it picked uptoo much time wasted on secondary characters like black widow the archer character and the every annoying samuel l jackson and his equally annoying character nick furygee i wanted to see action not a snippet here a snippet there and the hulk basically not being shown except for the near end and a slight flurry on the invisible flying boatnot enough of the major stars and just too ponderous and cheap laughs to break the long stretches of monotony plus like any cliqued movie the death of a character to bring the team together seen that too many timesbasically with some of the talent available for this movie the return was awful and i was just way too bored by the time the action hit and just annoyed by prementioned reliance on minor characters to really carecould have been wonderful but was a major disappointment,fantasy
first the positive side of things people eat bread so somebody has to bake bread people drive cars so somebody has to manufacture cars peolpe watch movies so somebody has to make movies good for them now for the actual review if watching train wrecks is one of your favorite hobbies and if you are generally star struck this movie is a mustsee the entire plot is a lot of nice computer animations covering over a veritable train wreck of predictable  yet quite often inexplicable  events actions and cheesy comments and the cast is eminent  if celebrity and not exercised talent is the 2012 definition of eminence a danish movie director who has had fair success in hollywood was once asked what it took artistically to make a blockbuster movie his answer understand that the average viewer is male 12 years old and moderately gifted and understand that there has to be something good something bad something awesome and something pretty the rest is less significant well this movie has it all here are some examples of the stereotypes heroesgood aliensbad fightingawesome scarlettpretty if you dont want to spend an hour and a half getting stupider go watch 3 episodes of friends the king of queens or something else which is at least mediocre and my final comments shame on you samuel shame on you robert shame on you gwyneth shame on you rest of cast,fantasy
i will keep this short and briefthe plot was paper thin the characters used cheesy lines which dragged the movie out and the special effects compensated for the former flaws the movie basically shows that consumers are dumb enough to actually rate a movie high like the rating is simply because enough special effects where thrown in their faces to distract from the awful partsto footnote only a few directors have actually been able to write and direct their own movie properly and with much success joss whedon is not one of them,fantasy
honestly i dont understand how such crappy movie could get so high notes the only thing that is coming to my mind is that a bunch of people hired by producers has written dozen of opinions and made thousands of votes via different accountsthere is nothing in this movie that can be described as funny entertaining or eyecatching story line is so miserable one can easily say there is no story line whatsoever it is just a series of predictable naive events without any kind of surprise or suspenseacting is typical for american movies  childishly bombastic pathetic dialogs and mimicry is so disgusting i wanted to leave cinema in the mid of the showno show is not a good description of what i have seeni hoped at least for special effects but my disappointment reached the ground cartoontype actions of hulk in fact there were no point of gathering all the heroes as hulk himself could easily defeat entire invading armada was the last coffin nailto summarize was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it does not happen often but i wanted that movie to end before it takes a spin what spin,fantasy
am i the only person that thought this movie was overrated dont get me wrong as superhero films go its decent but an 88 on imdb are you serious i wouldnt even put this in the top 250 never mind the top 30 for me there was no white knuckle ride nor tense moments in the film it didnt try to innovate in any way i saw the reviews on here before and expected good things perhaps a contender for the dark knight but i was completely wrong there was nothing particular wrong with the film but there was nothing great about it either i simply didnt get the thrill people promised methere were positives the acting was up to scratch and never did it become cheesy in anyway there were certain comedic aspects to the film that i did enjoy with robert downey jr taking point as the always entertaining tony stark iron man aside from that though to me it just seemed like yet another addition to the already saturated superhero genre with so many now i expected from the hype this may innovate in some way butit didntgoodbut in no way was it amazing,fantasy
okay first of all i am not your snooty critic who likes silent movies artsy stuff i love the action movies super hero comics i loved captain america movie iron man was good too however this movie was mindless crap there were no plot variations dialogs were comical at best it was just pointless cgi effects the villain had absolutely no depth and frankly was brainless at least change the script a bit put in some variations in the script and hire actors who have depth in acting captain america at least had a decent story line you could connect with the character the same with iron man and the same with the spider man series this one from the start was just mindless violence aliens blowing up crap all super hero movies should have a good story line a villain who can many shades to their character thats why dark knight was so good not only because the script had some meaningterrorism seeing the good versus bad in people and of course heath ledger amazing rendition of the joker i realize this isnt a movie that will win an oscar and also its meant to park your brain at home and just enjoy but at least put in some effort instead of just letting computer animation take over hollywood is getting lazier by the minute,fantasy
if ever there were an example of everything wrong with major movie review sites and hollywood movies today this film takes the cake over all othersto start this film was monstrously overbearingly advertised to every single medium containing pixels or paper in the world for months leading up to its release including the premise of the multiple years of collective marvel movies leading up to this single epic superhero mashup that would blow all other superhero movies away known as the there was so much hype surrounding this movie it became almost impossible not to see some kind of advertised praise of how epic it would be then came the imdb movie reviews within the weeks leading up to the release as well as multiple weeks beyond the premiere you would be hard pressed to find any review that wasnt at or near a perfect 1010 it quickly became apparent that these were paid reviewers as all the reviews seemed to have subtle words structure and nuances in common along with an extremely strange hyperindepth biographical portfolio of personal knowledge for the historical work of every writer producer director musician camera operator and even extras in the movie all extremely uncommon knowledge to be so readily described in every persons review to support this movie last was the extreme repetition of descriptions such as spellbinding breath taking edgeofyourseat etchoweveronce biting the bullet and paying money to finally see it i almost laughed out loud how in the world a movie with horribly stiff acting nearly no plot beyond bad guy wants to destroy the world we must put aside our differences and unite clich oddly outdated cgi terrible batman  robin 1997 style punchlines and puns surprisingly really lowbudget looking costumes and props and uneven main character screentime aka the is 85 the ironman show 10 the thor show 5 everyone else ever ever received any review score over 510 absolutely blows my minddont let the advertising infallible marvel diehards or paid reviews fool you this movie is the 2012 version of all those 90s superhero sequel attempted cashgrab franchise movies we grew to hate until their demise batman foreverbatman  robin the phantom etc ironman 1 and especially batman begins restored faith in the whole revamp the modern superhero movie the way it should have been genre and now its spiraling right back to bland dull blatant cash grabs with this movie the king of them all,fantasy

joss whedons the opens with the arrival of loki tom hiddleson norse god of mischief on the planet earth here he encounters nick fury samuel l jackson leader of a superhero law enforcement agency this introductory sequence is designed to show off both lokis ruthlessness and the manly coolness of nick fury but it achieves neither its an overlong sequence filled with bad cgi and secondrate actionthe film then offers a series of vignettes in which fury assembles a group of superheroes including captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr the hulk mark ruffalo and black widow scarlett johansson their task stop loki and his giant cgi army the problem all these superheroes are too busy bickering to band together organise and efficiently kick buttyour typical whedon tale centres on a scooby doo gangs of likable heroes serenity firefly buffy the vampire slayer the astonishing xmen etc and ends with a hero sacrificially dying for the greater good whedons heroes are also never able to prevail without a little help from their buddies and there is always some tension between being the sole saviour and having to work with others to accomplish a goal as he typically has only tiny budgets at his disposal whedon also relies heavily on clever writing witty banter and comedic irreverence to generate excitement with the however he has been granted zillions of dollars and has been unconsciously domesticated by the demands of the summer blockbuster the result is a film which is continually pulling in two directions wanting to be huge bloated and filled with generic spectacle on one hand and wanting to be clever small and intimate on the other in the end the vulgarity of money wins out over good prosestill a number of classic whedon moments do survive one cleverly written vignette has black widow tied to a chair seemingly being interrogated by a gang of villains we then learn that it is she who is in control of the situation and that it is she who is interrogating them another clever moment sees loki imprisoned in a glass cage at the heart of our heroes stronghold yes that clich again no one realising that loki has designed his own capture the god of mischief attempting to live up to his namesake and sow discord within his enemys own home most of the films other good scenes revolve around the hulk whos imbued with much pathos by mark ruffalo an actor renowned for his many melancholicman roles ruffalo elevates everything he touchesthe rest of the unfortunately degenerates into cgi fisticuffs michael bay styled mayhem exploding cities cgi aliens errant missiles and sequences which feel like an angry kid bashing action figures together heres a film which spends zillions of dollars bludgeoning us when a guy like whedon can cook up infinitely more excitement with a simple rope chair or the sheer possibility that the hulk might go schizoid like most marvel projects the mistakes excess for excitementwhedons never been a good visualist even his stint writing for the xmen comics the astonishing xmen a series arc which plays almost exactly like whedons the movie relied more on words banter and the energy of his prose than well drawn panels in this regard most of the is slow and generically shot though it does contain a few great visuals a brief shot of a swat squad advancing on the hulks tiny shack is particularly cool beyond this the film offers the usual superhero subtext here the enemy hopes to invade america new york and obtain the tesseract a much coveted cube which can provide endless energy and which was placed on earth thousands of years ago by gods our heroes of course band together to stop the theft of the tesseract in a previous marvel film captain america a nazi figure called red skull also attempted to acquire this energy source in marvel lore its always our squeaky clean white western ubermensch who decide who gets to keep earths resources same as the real world though the pentagon rarely wears spandex when its nuking for oil gridsincidentally whedons loki is one of the most pathetic supervillains of all time hes a whiny dude with all the menace of a high school chemistry teacher youd think the would assemble only for big fish but no they apparently take on wimpy norse gods as well7510  see josh tranks chronicle,fantasy
the represents everything thats bad in a hero movie in my opinion this movie should be nominated for one of the most disappointing movie of the year the movie is not funny barely action and has a terrible plot the villain in the movie loki was the most bad villain character in the history of movies and not in the good way i hope for me and for everybody else that there will not be a sequel because it will ruin everything that batman has built about a comics movie i was merciful and gave it 310 because robert downey jr succeed to do something good in this movie but for the rest of the cast you owe me 25 hours from my life,fantasy
the displays joss whedons flawless comedic timing and his ability to balance fun among serious situations perfectly one can see why buffy  angel were a huge success  fireflyserenity a huge cult hit welcome to the big leagues mr whedonas for the movie i like this movies hulk more than the two standalone movies this movie showcases why the hulk can work best as a supporting character instead of the lead hawkeye in my opinion was an odd character to add and the movie could have done just as well without him the other characters perform their parts well but robert downey jrs tony stark steals the spotlight every time he is onscreen the chemistry between the cast is seamless i also loved seeing coby smulders as a badass action chick although its a shame she did not see much actionthe only downsides i can think of is the sometimes cheesy dialogs mostly by samuel l jacksons nick fury and some very loose usage of technical slangother than that here is a toast to the and i am surely up for seeing the 2 iron man 3 and a man can dream coby smulders in an action movie,fantasy
so here it is after nearly fifty years the have finally made the transition from page to screen and best of all it does not manage to disappoint much of this is down to joss whedon and the pitchperfect castingat first the choice of whedon as director surprised me somewhat i really like whedon dont get me wrong but with a background in television and his most notable cinematic efforts being the screenplay for the first toy story and the unfortunately overlooked serenity he struck me as an odd choice but make no mistake that even with millions more dollars at hand whedon fortunately remains true to himself keeping humour in sight with plenty of instantly quotable quips and wisecracks throughout he is confident and assured with these treasured characters managing to juggle all these superheroes and one super egowere all used to most of  the cast members by now robert downey jr as iron man chris hemsworth as thor samuel l jackson as nick fury chris evans as captain america scarlett johansson as black widow clark gregg as agent coulson tom hiddleston as loki but we also have some new players in the form of jeremy renner as hawkeye and mark ruffalo as hulk what is most brilliant is that all the actors impress i was eagerly anticipating seeing evans as rogers again after falling in love with his solo effort but it was in fact ruffalo who struck me the most his portrayal as the tortured bruce banner was nuanced believable and very human applying emotion to a difficult role hiddleston was true pleasure as the villainous loki giving a fantastic performance and wonderfully delivering many great linesone quibble i had was hawkeyes lack of screentime but that can be ignored as i suspect he will either get a spinoff or have a larger role in the sequel this is the very opposite to say christopher nolans batman trilogy instead of being dark realistic and multilayered this is the very synthesis of a big bright summer movie a blast from start to finish with humour and large action sequences while lokis army were a bit too transformersesque for my liking i still thoroughly enjoyed the film and exited the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face overall an excellent blockbuster which deserves the praise its getting all i want is for whedon to the sequel,fantasy
 assemble has been smashing the box offices all around the world it is tipped to be one of the highest grossing films of all time the film has been strongly anticipated by marvel fans worldwide who stuck on through the credits of the original character films to see nick fury played by samuel l jackson hint at the upcoming filmthe film itself has certainly lived up to the hype the cast is superb with an all star cast including robert downey jr chris evans scarlett johansson chris hemsworth samuel l jackson and gwyneth paltrow it also includes new up and comers mark ruffalo jeremy renner and tom hiddlestonin the very beginning it is quite dull but it gets progressively better and better as it goes along the cast all work together really well and there are tonnes of laughs and shining moments robert downey jr iron mantony stark is definitely one of the shining stars downey jr and johansson were the best of the bunch they both did some fantastic acting and were absolutely hilarious chris evans captain americasteve rogers annoyed me because his character is very cocky and relatively boring yet he got quite a lot of screen timethe film has its ups and it has its minor downs but overall the film was fantastic and i really enjoyed watching it im sure there will be a sequel heres hoping its as good as this,fantasy
harboring a great deal of expectation of this recordbreaking multisuperheroinarow action mashup i finally caught up the last chance to watch it on the big screen but unfortunately the film has indomitably become my very first disappointment in 2012 alerted by the general opinion of if you can survive the boring first 60 minutes the latter part will blow you away maybe boring is a lesser word the interconversations among these superheroes are way too tedious to arouse any interest and in light of my last encounter with thor 2011 i know he is a boredom then here comes his worsen twin captain america so it is dumb and dumber situation most of characters are reprising their usual roles robert downey jrs sleekness is being harnessed into its maximum quota so i assume the only revelation could come from jeremy renners hawkeye the newcomer on screen and the third candidate of hulk mark ruffalo but the truth is they might be a clear torrent but cannot save this juggernaut from being a destroyitall dross the fighting scenes are the saving grace here which is not a false claim but it satisfies my eyes without compensates my soul director joss whedon just haphazardly levels everything in manhattan without any single casualty provided to imply its minimum credibility no worries at all we simply witnessed an empty and meaningless catastrophe without any mind activity as we all know iron man will not be the sacrifice as a sequel is already set on a release date thus am i overdemanding here after the invasion of myriads of this sort of bigbudget action flicks the is no way a standout by any means none of its actors could stick out with any arresting existence i might be too desperate to count out gwyneth paltrow mark ruffalo is the closest choice of a decent acting in it all the rest is just the way he or she is an utterly featherweight character study is the case here the gags are scarce ooh poor loki too much scifi doctrines and the narrative in dead earnest thanks to you mr samuel l jackson makes the films lengthy screen time too overt to be slighted and i waited until the endcredit rolled over but a second bonus scenes never show off the films huge success has baffled me so much and its staggering status of the third biggest grossing film of all time after avatar 2009 and titanic 1997 does make me do some solemn postmortem to question my taste the conclusion could be that i may be detached from the majoritys liking which thankfully i believe heralds a good sign for me right,fantasy
i dont get itnot that it was a bad movie it was fun it was okaybut some surprisingly poor filmmaking it doesnt help that i loathe handheld camera you spend all this money and then muddy up the shots with a handheld its the cancer on the testicles of cinematography buy a dolly or tripod or steadicamim just glad that i didnt see this in 3d which is another headscratcher for me stargate or independence day was shot better any hong kong action movie is shot better any jackie chan movie is shot betterthe story was better than average a good amount of very bad and stilted dialog though lokis ulterior motive on being captured was amazingly transparentacting was generally good i dont know if you call what downey does as acting its him being charming which works most of the time but scarlette a looker but not getting much better at her craftand i thought it was just silly to see her faceoff with the alien invasion with a handgunand did hawkeyes arrows magically replenish themselves 3 4 5 times during the final battle hemmesworth will be a very good actor in ten years but hes okay now but too small to be thor thoughand please how was the final battle not a carbon copy of transformers 3 i liked serenity and cabin in the woods but i think josh was in over his head on this,fantasy
the plot took way too long to get going and once it got started was like every super hero movie that has come out in the past 10 years very boring for the first 23 of the movie the support cast was a joke no need for some of the characters because they took away from the moviepro once the villian came along finally the action scenes were pretty solid each avenger had a critical role in the action and no one character seemed to take on more than the othersthe second trailer is going to have to look amazing or else ill be skipping out on it,fantasy
does so many voters as i write this 430 give only 110 they cant be serious about voting no one can honestly be true about voting like that this really is the best marvel superhero movie ever what are they afraid of and the so called top 1000 voters  shame on them really often we see top 1000 voters who presses a movie down  by giving bad votes once in a while some of the old movies are ready to get out of the top 250 list they have to accept that the project to get the together has been done in an excellent way  bravo i was not sure what to get  because so many heroes should work together would someone steal the limelight and would it be 80 iron man and 20 no its is pure 100 thank you,fantasy
the was very well waited among marvel comic book fans and general superhero fans when it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the films other previously established heroes he abstains all together and maybe thats for the best even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill theres precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in marvel mythology those who havent done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time in the mix among stars doing battle are scarlett johansson who plays the black widow and jeremy renner as archery expert hawkeye there were a lot of high expectations for this film and on many levels it delivers while on few others it disappoints since writerdirector joss whedon was dealing with so many bigname stars like robert downey jr who reprises his role as iron man gwenyth paltrow as pepper potts and mark ruffalo who takes over the role of dr bruce banner aka the hulk theres just not enough screen time to fit everyone adequately infor those who have kept up with it though the is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to comeas a rewatch 050118 and nearly 5 years since initial watch 121013 opinions remain near same the has great entertainment value though at the same time some of it feels quite bland and uninteresting the finale battle elevates the film as a whole but much forgettable scenes i had forgotten,fantasy
what in the actual hell 82 people you gave it 82 ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh1 nick fury played by a weak voiced pip squeak whiny voiced guy forgot his name yeah know hes famous but all the way through b movie acting montel williams acted better in that nuclear missile movie not that he woulda pulled that role off though2 i hate that damn cia guy whatever he is the shield moron the cutesy white guy his look doesnt match his personality in the movie in my opinion and his acting was eh like idolizing captain america the hell for so he did some stuff in the past long ago thanks to an experiment and for that he becomes an idol hes still a moron hes just on magic steroids witha special shield oooooooo3 how can scarlett whatever he character name is be all calm and cool like a snake and blow up a hospital with people in it but then when the hulk fights her they show this stupid scene of her doing a horribly fake shaking hugging her knee like shes scared only her acting with the shaking is utterly kiddie like terrible not believable and oh yeah so i was gonna say how can she be scared all the sudden after being cool as a snake actually more fearless since she was at the beginning of the movie being dropped from a huge height while tied up but then when moron hulk pops out shes shaking like a little baby huh 4 why did thor suddenly act like he was out of breath when that dumb shield agent i just mentioned got stabbed that winds thor fail5 why is the guy playing captain america a stiff why when thor slammed his shield did he get up and then do a slow robot turn how stupid and then when iron man mentions the red level he does this stiff and it happened to fast bad directing step back like hes just realized something profound but it looks dumb6 so when captain america jumps towards the lever they make a computer generated version of him jumping why it looked dumb like those stupid cgs of spiderman in the spiderman movies just dumb7 how the hell is the hulk intelligent in this movie when hes supposed to be an angry retard 8 why is thor always being a cry baby in this movie stupid so shallow bad directing9 how the hell is thor able to be stabbed by a little blade when the hulk cant even make him bleed ooops 10 what was with the fake what happened sht at the end when iron man woke up damn that was so fake and pretentious and weak what what happened i cant remember directing a nuclear missile into a wormhole and going into outer space and being pushed out by the explosion whu whu shut up11 oh and damn how cheap was that when scarlett got pinned by some metal rod thing and damn how could you not smell the director saying oh check out her ass ugh stupid shes already wearing tight pants moron director yet you decided to say curve ur ass up its for the little boys when her ass is already all over the movie in those tight pants you cheap idiot12 why is hawkeye played by an oldish ugly guy with shtty acting skill he was good in hansel and gretel however its spelled but sucky in this movie who the hells idea was it to do that gay scene where he crashes into the building window and goes ah aaaah when he landed on his back like that was so profound and making this epic music to that he shouldnt have even been in the movie his role was so pathetic and dumbthe only guys in here whose acting was great was iron man and loki i never once thought loki out of character maybe for a split second but that was just day dreaming not cuz of his acting and pepper who was way underused was good never think of her as gywneth when shes actingand what the hell scarlett is being used in age of ultron she sucks man shes some pretentious fighter bitch her ass is not that great shes too short you cant think of any better females to plug in that movie you have to use her whoever is directing these movies is an idiot with bad taste sad such a great soundtrack was used for such a sht movie,fantasy
this picture was the highest grossing film of 2012 and was raved about and spoke highly of however in my opinion this movie was heavily overrated and didnt really offer anything groundbreaking or worth whilethe films story is weak to say the least and is presented in the form of here you go here it is the main plot for this film is loki has somehow come back from the dead and has joined forces with an alien race called the chitauri to take over the earth with the stolen tesseract so with hawkeye and selvig brainwashed and kidnapped shields base destroyed there is no other option but to begin the initiative thats it this story might not sound to bad which in reality it doesnt even though being a bit simple the reason i think the story is weak is because there are so many plot holes which are never explained or expanded on examples of these plot holes arehow did loki can come back from the dead how did thor return from asgard to earth the inconsistency of how the hulk can control his anger why was it when iron man throws the nuclear missile into the rift where the chitauri mother ship is it kills every chitauri warrior on earth picky one how are the actually talking to each other when none of them are actually wearing earpiecesthe films start is very under looked because of the good climax to be honest the start is actually boring and not compelling at all this is why i think this film is heavily overrated as people only remember the very well done battle scene so theyre the major issues with the films however there are some positives all of the actors perform very well especially tom hiddleston as loki but with the exception of jeremy renners portrayal of hawleye which was very dull and boring action sequences are handled well but sometimes cam across repetitive and didnt offer anything new or exciting the special effects and cgi was very good and didnt look bad or too unrealistic the films pay off is also very satisfying i can only hope that in the upcoming 2 age of ultron they can add something new or compelling,fantasy
ive read some marvels comics but not enough to become a fan and this film is averageim just too easy what is this is loki the villain that weak maybe he couldnt adapt to the earths environment and his army look like theyre adopted from transformers whats good about this film its 3d nothing moreit took me almost a week to watch this because its too boring our superheroes their jokes their love line their problem no interesting easily solved endold superheroes formula boring story if you want to kill time go on,fantasy
it is very much save to say that only truly super hero addicts will love this i dont read the comics anymore because id rather read a book or watch a movie could be my age as well this is overrated beyond all ends the villain is annoying beyond all ends because you have to incorporate so many characters you have to cram all this crap into one movie and personally the individual films are much better this felt like an overdose of flashy sht everywhere and the story is rather dull i went in this movie with high hopes because i on occasion enjoy super hero movies my favorites have to be the tim burton  christopher nolan batman films those were fantastic this is a mess with over two hours of flashy ridiculous plot twists and cgi up the a only super hero comic book addicts and little kids will really appreciate this if you have a brain and want more realism in a film avoid this crap aside i gave it a 5 because some of the special effects were impressive and some of the action was cool and lets be real scarlett johanson is hot as hell but this movie barely qualifies as a 5 you want a true action film with a super hero taste go with the dark knight or batman begins,fantasy
warning the reviewer is a comic book reader but only reads the graphic novels published by dc comics therefore it is up to the reader of this review to make a decision for themselves over this review is biased or noti was not expecting much from the when i first heard of it i was pretty disappointed with marvels previous films which claimed to lead up to this huge climax iron man had its moments but dont talk to me about its sequel captain america was only redeemed thanks to hugo weaving and nazis and thorwellthor was just plain rubbish so to be honest did not act on the contrary the plot is that of a childrens tv programme not of a supposed oscar worthy blockbuster the villain loki and his henchmen had no thought but in to him at all he is a stereotype that has just been used too often a warmongering idiotic englishman and they were given no back story at all  who the hell where they the icing on the cake is that some of the acting and directing is just appalling and there is one scene where this factor is incredibly prominenthawkeye is on top of a building firing arrows at the aliens and captain america is with other members  i cant really remember ive tried my very best to erase this movie from my mind and starts to talk to the archer but how neither of them are wearing microphones or shouting if there is a logical explanation i do apologize but i seriously doubt it i have done research on all of the featured and no where was there a mention of telepathic powershaving said these horrid things i did enjoy robert downey jr and black widow was nice eye candypeople who will enjoy this hardcore marvel fans children under 12 robert downey jr fans and perverts,fantasy
only in excess of 1400 reviews of this so far  what could possibly be added at this point it is obvious that the comicbook readers and nostalgics of which i could have still been maybe ten years ago were more than elated to see all of their favorite fourcolor heroes in live action together all at once sharing the big screen as if a marvel comic came to life and had very nearly no budget restrictions whatsoeverbut seriously  loki in the 1960s thor comics maybe he was still a villain one could love to loathe but nowadays neither the character nor the actor portraying him poor guy were remotely interesting the army at his disposal was made up of some sort of thirdrate alien race that ironically enough evoked some of rival dcs aliens from their invasion crossover event back in the 90s because they couldnt use the skrulls  right if those show up anywhere it will be in a fantastic four movie how amusing to see the marvel universe split up that way  due to their overzealous ambition to expand their properties share of the movie industry it is truly priceless and more so with the odd choice for replacements here much has been said about turning nick fury into ebony fury personally i think it improved the rather bland james bond wannabe type that the character was for several decades following his introduction in the comicbookies however samuel l jackson is not half the actor lawrence fishburne is the latter could pull off morpheus but the former is simply not convincing as shaft mace windu agent augustus in the xxx movies which naturally prepared him for this one here and truth be told he must be taking this part about as seriously as his role in snakes on a planeand as for the themselves  aside from the extremely convincing hulk and customized too in order to look more like human thespian counterpart mark ruffalo  i am sure edward norton and eric bana were so green with envy  not and the eversolid robert downey jr as iron man he truly made this character his own the rest is somewhat disappointing as thor has still not grown on me captain america seems illserved by chris evans acting range and hawkeye well anyone could have played hawkeye the single most disappointing character has to be scarletts black widow i mean wow that linedelivery and lack of expressiveness is worthy of a razzie or two  come on especially that line amidst the big battle in new york  i dont see how that can be a party was it i paraphrase even kristen stewart could not have been this badshield leaves me uninterested flat out as well it should it had future tv series spinoff written all over it that must be why now it took me only a few seconds to figure out why all of this looked so damn familiar as if id seen this movie before and i sure did the gathering of characters everyone knows their peril aboard a ship and then the big battle with a common foe  the exact same plot was seen a few years ago in lxg thats right the league of extraordinary gentlemen the movie warner bros approved because it was cheaper to produce than a fullfledged justice league movie and these were still a long way from assembling back then so why was the lxg so poorly received  and the praised the lxg had a better more iconic ship than the shields whatever its called  it was the nautilus the lxg had a better action gal too in peta wilson the lxg had one of the original action stars  sean connery himself im sorry but no matter how much i appreciate him robert downey jr doesnt quite measure up to the original james bond and it only stands to reason too as the lxg gathered up classic literature characters rather than superheroes who all have collectively or individually less than 100 years of history and yet the need to constantly revamp their mystique is already felt perhaps it is due to the fact that they lack originality the hulk is after all nothing but a ripoff of mister hyde thor was borrowed from norse mythology  and modified hawkeye wants to be robin hood with an attitude need i go on the were only more anticipated and considerably more well received because the target audience was primed and ready for it they read these heroes stories in their childhood and had wanted this for so long that simply wasnt the case for the lxg the kids who read those and viewed them in the same light are all dead of old age already for my money the lxg had the better script  and more believable action the lone long action sequence is truly the only lasting impression one is left with with this overhyped production  and i had seen it on youtube before i got to see the film in its entirety that doesnt say much for the rest of this marvelfest  does itand quite frankly thanos looks ridiculous too but they have time to improve him a bit for 2 although with batista as drax the destroyer how hokey will the overall finished product get to be,fantasy
i am not a fan boy and have very little knowledge in the history of the characters but it seemed to me like a real hodgepodge of mismatched heroes and no real problem in the movie thor cant die hes a god iron man is sort of impenetrable the hulk cant die captain america is just a douche bag the entire movie why start saving like 510 innocent people when the entire world is at stake i really didnt feel this movie or the heroes scarlett johansen at least made some sense in this gang of totally invincible heroes as she had some brain at least not to say iron man didnt but he also has tons of firepower the one really astonishing actor in this movie was loki he really made a realistic and hate able characther a movie worth watching just for him,fantasy
all i can say is that i am very unimpressed with this filmthe action is not too satisfying and very predictable the acting is passable the dialogue is at a strict minimum and the story is pretty much nonexistent in short its a whole bunch of cgi and explosions put together similar to michael bays transformers movies the only strong point of this movie is the cast but in my opinion this goes to waste because none of them are really given any interesting materialcontext to work withi suggest you avoid it unless youre a diehard comic fan or if you really want to see chris evans chris hemsworth and rdj together on screen and fantasize about them,fantasy
the was an action packed movie from start to finish it was fun and entertaining to watch to be honest i didnt know the background of each of the superheroes because i rarely get a chance to sit down and watch an entire movie but the plot was kept pretty simple so it was pretty easy to follow even for someone like mei thought that this movie was absolutely hilarious there was a steady amount of humor throughout the entire movie that just keeps you rolling and makes it just about impossible not to laugh the scene where the hulk grabbed a hold of loki and was pounding him into the floor mid sentence was just the hilarious i was rolling out of my seat the iron man really had quite a few good lines too that gave the movie just enough seasoning to entice youin my opinion though i thought this movie was just ok i felt like there were too many scenes that were impossible and not clearly laid out and it dragged down the movies quality for example when captain america was waiting on iron man to queue him to pull the lever when they were fixing the engine an enemy came and started shooting at him continually captain america had no protection or safe haven for quite some time but he still was never injured or another example was at the end when iron man fell from the sky after taking the atom bomb up into space to be honest i thought it was absolutely ridiculous that he walked away from that unharmed i guess im too realistic for fairy talesthere were some parts that i couldnt understand either such as how things ended up with lokis brother it seemed to me at first that he was not on the superheroes side and then he ended up being a good guy and also while in the plane after loki was captured he said hes worried about what will happen after his brother shows up and then later he turns completely cocky and is not intimidated by his brother at all maybe its just me but i thought because of these things this movies quality wasnt that great so in my opinion this movie was pretty predictable and lacked any kind of twists in it it was a typical good versus evil movie and ive seen lots of them,fantasy
i cannot believe the has received such stellar reviews by 13 the way into the film none of the characters draw one in the story is uncompelling and i find myself only waiting in boredom for the next fight scenes which turn out to be formulaic and insufficient to warrant further viewing the designs for various scenes and characters also fail they look plastic and cheap and distracting from the story rather than immersive save your time and money and skip this title evidently these reviews have a minimum line count which is equivalent to paying by the word so let me be verbose this film was not even fun to watch the villains tearing apart the world because they look so silly in their costumes their character building moments are horribly predictable and shallow and what is up with the designs for loki he looks more samurai than scandinavian god which i am sure is a tip of the hat to the samurai influence in comic books but lets get real for a moment hes a bloody norse god he should look norse if hes going to look so radically different from norse mythology  all cyberneticanime  then there needs to be some kind of story and character building to explain it,fantasy
i had skyhigh expectations for this movie since the day i heard about it im a huge fan of whedon and downey jr and i almost peed my pants during the endcredits scene of iron man 2008 i knew the probability of this movie being bad were higher but i had to watch it anyways heres a summary of my experience watching the movie jumping with glee when it began sitting at the edge of my seat and laughing my head of while it was going on and shaking by the time i walked out the acting is amazing especially by mark ruffalo his hulk was surprisingly funny i expected rdj to steal the show as usual but all the characters were expertly balanced by joss whedon the action sequences are stunning and the final battle is awe inspiring and humorous at the same time loki was very well portrayed by tom hiddleston not only are all the technical aspects of this movie brilliant but the storyline as well the movie is truly a piece of art only with explosions so that makes it better best movie of the year dont miss itps the midcredits scene in this one is a doozy lets go get some shawarma now,fantasy
i actually was not expecting to be that good but i really got to say that was one of the best movies i have ever seen a really good plot the biggest and most amazing scenes of battle ever spectacular performances by our heroes and all the cast awesome visuals effects and another amazing soundtrackone of the things that really impressed me was the fact the each hero received the right amount of time on the screen and for that was possible to see how much work did everyone doof course once more we have the amazing performance of robert downey jr as iron man that gives us the humor and bravery that we wanted to see by this character but he is not the only good actor in the movie we also have chris evans as captain america that delivers the leadership needed scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff  black widow that show us how amazing a woman can be in a situation of danger chris hemsworth as thor that gives us that bravery strenght and performance we wanted to see from him tom hiddleston as loki that delivers the big villain with no compassion that this movie needed clark gregg as phil coulson funny and brave as always cobie smulders as maria hill the new woman with a lot of potential stellan skarsgrd as dr erik selvig also great performance jeremy renner as clint barton  hawkeye a actor that show us archery like no one and spectacular performance our samuel l jackson as nick fury funny and amazing as always and another new entrance in the film mark ruffalo as dr bruce banner  hulk that delivers the incredible hulk we all wanted to see everyone that was a part of the cast direction production have my congratulations for the amazing work to give us the movie we all wished forreally spectacular movie 1010,fantasy
from the beginning off this movie turned one completely off the choice of a bad guy was horrible a pure hype machine of a movie robert downey is a good actor but his trite portrayal of being charming grows tiresome marvel movies have always lacked depth and true heart however this movie engages than cruises by fast a popcorn movie full of great marketing a movie like this deserves one view but really easy to forget its poorly written acted due to all the hype its time for robert to hang the the suit up the first iron man was the only good one the character is now dull and annoying liam as thor has no onscreen like ability or charisma chris evans plays a somewhat convincing role but he couldnt act his way through fast and furious mark ruffalo is the only saving grace of this movie the hulk will always be a hard hero to get right he makes it work on all levels all in all this movie has become pop culture thats all a dumb popcorn movie that works until it starts and ends another mediocre marvel movie pretty much this leaves nothing to the imagination,fantasy
its a fun movie but the plot is very generic and shallow the villains in this movie are extremely weak without giving away the plot at no point does the viewer actually feel the superheroes are in dangeri have an irrational hatred of captain america so i am rounding down from the 65 score that i feel it deserves his quote about hitler directly contradicts his role in the film hes a filthy hypocrite that gives the americuh vibe its a fun watch but this is evidence of the dumbing down of cinema for a worldwide audienceoverseas markets are big money but because cultures are so diverse to appeal to the world the movie is forced into a least common denominator i often find  of sales worldwide to be indicative to how dumbed down a movie is,fantasy
date 27 june 2012 first time watch like everyone else i was interested in seeing the so i finally went to go see it after it came out over a month ago and has grossed over six hundred million after the movie was over i realized it wasnt as good as i thought it would be the storyline was like ever other action movie bad guy wants something some complications between the group lots of cars flying around good guys win why does this movie do better dont ask me im not saying the movie was terrible it was enjoyable for the most part downey had some awesome one liners but it wasnt spectacular if you want see this movie definitely go see it at the theaters if you want till dvd ill think youll be disappointed even more since you werent in the theater to get the whole experience overall seven out of ten stars710,fantasy
this movie is what every comic book movie has ever wished it could be it has everything the audience wanted and more not just an exploding good time but a legitimately good film its well written has character and plot development stunning visual effects fantastic action sequences and most importantly the themselves my favorite thing about the introduction of the characters is that they dont all appear at once the come together one at a time planning to accomplish their own goals at first only discover that they all have a common enemy and the world needs them its a smart and good pace that the film follows allowing the audience to breath a little the cast acts their parts in a way that comic book films almost never succeed in they have dynamic and rope you in every second you can even put aside captain americas dorky costume because everything about this movie is so good best part no romantic crap in this movie everything is short simple and to the stuff we care about,fantasy
the is a superhero masterpiece marverls idea of bringing together the to one motion picture was genius and the execution was masterful joss whedons humor brings nothing but benefit to the already great story and action scenes of course robert downey jrs portrayal of tony stark is certainly awesome and mark ruffalos bruce banner is the best ive seen so far the most outstanding character is in fact the hulk and whedons humor shines best with him the entire team eventually works together perfectly the only minor flaws that are pointed out by certain critics are the lack of story and character establishment however because this is in fact a sequel to the five films i believe that anyone who has seen thor will surely understand why loki does seek domination over earth and it is also why i believe the characters are ones who have already been established in their own films and the is an allout motion picture meant only to entertain it does so indeed is the best super hero movie yet and most likely will stay so for a long time,fantasy
this movie was awesome it couldve been 10 stars if i wouldve seen more hulk scenes cant you tell im a huge hulk fan lol  anyways it was good very well put together i saw it twice going on a 3rd well maybe i havent decided yet i have a question tho i follow the comics not real heavy but i read up on things are we going to have an movie almost every year for the next 34 years cause in the comics they come across wolverine spiderman and etc during there next fight with thanos and if so hows it going to happen fox has rights to some of those people if not all i dont know i guess im just looking for more action they made corny lord of the rings 4 hours long how bout for the next and next time give the hulk more scenes hes the best one plus cant be stopped nor slowed down i didnt like how they made him slow down meaning it seemed like oh he needed help oh please thats the hulk baby green all dayhulk smash,fantasy
this is an amazing movie the effects were great and although i only went to the 2d showing id recommend this film to anyonethe best part of this movie for me was the mighty thor the worst part has to be the really crappy superheroes black widow and the guy with the bow yeah he was so interesting that i dont even know who it was too much emphasis on those 2 as characters and not enough hulkcaptain america was amazing but it totally casts a shadow over any fantastic 4 collaboration being believable in the future i enjoyed the singular captain america movie after a second watch but this movie was mind blowingdr banner my secret is im always angry amazing,fantasy
many times a movie is so anticipated with so much buzz surrounding it audiences cant help but be disappointed on some level joss whedons  marvels the  had a lot to prove as it hit theaters at midnight on may 4 when building up a movie through five separate ones over a span of five years you better be able to deliver im happy to say cast and crew delivered big timemarvels the avenger is probably one of the best superhero films ever made thats a lot coming from me because im a dc comics guy i dont even read marvel or keep up with the universe i recommend spending the extra money to see the movie in imax 3d for the complete experience if youre a fan of the hulk prepare yourself to see him as you never have before in a liveaction film,fantasy
the is a scifisuperhero movie with a lot of amazing moments in the history of film this movie was long awaited and it was definitely worth the waitthe truly had a crack at being a number 1 movie and its attempt worked it has really good action scenes with a few laughs along the way the movie really had to work hard with the character development and the end result was perfect scarlet johansson was great as black widow but black widow really needs her own movie to start her off fresh this was a bad opening for her hawkeye who was introduced also was fabulous i wasnt happy with captain america the first avenger because the movie was dreadful but captain america really got the spotlight he deserved the script was amazing as was the scifi plot which was truly intelligent even if you dont like the movie you will have fun anyway 1010 a great movie even with high standards,fantasy
the has proved to be the best movie ive seen in years ive watched it 4 times already and still cant get enough of it the casting of the hulk was impeccable they truly could not have chosen a more perfect actor than mark ruffalo for this role he portrays banner in a way that would have made bill bixby proud and had they cast him in the previous hulk films id have two additional movies on my shelf but i digress robert downy jr as usual brought the most amazing array of sarcasm and wit to the screen his audacity always has just the right amount of pluck and pomp to press all the right buttons while tip toeing playfully on all the wrong ones the entire cast of this film were perfectly chosen and each one brought dynamic energy to their character the is an absolute must see and see again and again sort of film and i cannot praise it enough,fantasy
the starts with a bang as the god loki emerges through a gate in space into a remote research facility he converts a few people to work with him including agent barton aka hawkeye jeremy renner his plan is of course to take over the world and enslave all the humans or as he puts it free them from freedom shield director nick fury samuel l jackson assembles a group of superheroes including the vain iron man robert downey jr the asgardian thor chris hemsworth the warrior captain america chris evans and my personal favorite the powerful awesome and spectacular hulk mark ruffalo the purpose of these heroes is to combat the threat loki this movie was great from start to finish sure the director went a little overboard with the special effects and the flying aircraft carrier was a little much but otherwise it was fun clever and exciting joss whedon did a great job of mashing all these heroes who each had their unique personalities into one film which acknowledged each and every one of them the humour was smart well placed and perfectone thing though is that the 3d was awful it made the screen dark and it made people sitting offcentre nauseous so if you are going to see this movie i suggest seeing it in 2d i also suggest sitting near the wall because during the intense action scenes the walls vibrate and it gives you a feeling of actually being in the movie this movie probably would only appeal to the young people as young people love the sensation and the insanity shown in these films,fantasy
i loved it more than captain america loves his shield the is a spectacular blend of comedy and action which more than fulfilled my lofty expectations i cant wait to go and watch it again with the misses and our boyi had some apprehension regarding how hawkeye was being portrayed in some of the trailers he seemed to have little dialogue and screen time as a hawkeye fan i was afraid he was going to get shortchanged in the film i was also wondering how they were going to work in all the characters with such a large cast glad to say all my fears were smashed like the hulk smashes carscheck out our full review at 3guys1moviecom,fantasy
absolutely brilliantnot a single dull moment in this movie great to see robert downey jr after sherlock holmesright on the button he is having amazing sense of representing tony stark in the iron man franchise and now in the captain america thor were fabulous in this movie the action was top notch scarlett was ok and i missed edward norton as hulk although mark has done an excellent job as hulk especially with some of his interactions with other super heroes i wish hawk eyes character would have been given better treatment he was lost in the crowd of super heroes all greats ensemble to form this wonderful movie go watch and enjoy all the super heroes of america,fantasy
the was truly one of the greatest action movies i have ever experienced im not the type of person who hypes up about a movie but this one was worth the hype the emotionality between the team and the suspense brought by the battle scenes i have never experienced something similar to it all the action going on kept you on the edge of your seat about to burst out screaming making a movie in which all the major super heroes are involved is hard specially as you have to unite them all in an adventure that makes sense for all of them to be in i have to say that in this movie the plot was beautifully put together and made absolute sense the lines the movements the sets everything was perfect i congratulate the actors and the director for this wonderful movie the conflict between the siblings of asgard the jealousy the emotionality between them fully portrayed what the fight for fair and freedom for all it was a wonderful experience which i am willing to go through once again,fantasy
since 2008 we have had two iron man films a better hulk film a thor film and captain america film as each film was released we were given clues to something bigger coming up may 4th 2012 gave us the advengersdirector nick fury of shield has a crisis to deal with at a secret shield facility where experiments are being conducted on the tesseract an energy cube with unlimited power open a portal and thors evil slick power mad halfbrother loki who was exiled now is free loki takes the tesseract and professor erik selvig and shield agent clint barton to help get more items to reopen the portal and bring an alien army to help him take over the earth so will the meet this challenge or fail in saving earththe film is 142 minutes long but once things get going time isnt a problem the cast of robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner samuel l jackson tom hiddleston stellan skarrgard clark gregg and gwyneth paltrow give good performancesyou know that there are two more special scenes as the credit roll and lets say that both will get your attention i plan to go see it again because it is so much fun to view,fantasy
im giving no spoilers here since i am wanting to make anybody who hasnt seen this movie to go hit the movie theaters asap needless to say the is everything you want and more in a superhero blockbuster flick marvel truly put a lot of effort into this movie and it really does show a lot they not only did a huge team up movie but they also created one that was deep compelling and brilliantly done every hero weve seen in this movie is given not only a fair amount of time on screen as a group but each one also individually we see their struggles with their times as a superhero and each one of them has an arc of their own even some of the side characters get their own fair share of screen time and i for one applaud that the action scenes are beautifully well done in this movie and some of the best ive seen in a superhero flick especially the final battle not only does this movie succeed in also being strong in character development and action but its humor is also top notch i burst out laughing at a lot of those funny moments and i think you will too when you see them there is a lot of eye candy to behold in the movie as well and everything looks brilliant and feels brilliant im not going to go into more of this movie so i dont dare spoil anything for you all but it has to be said right now the is quite possibly the best movie of 2012 ive ever seen the story is excellent the characters are superb the effects are top notch there is plenty of funny moments and everything in this movie is well balanced from beginning to end if you havent seen this movie then do so its everything you want in a superhero movie and you cant miss it at all get to the theater today and see this movie,fantasy
im not gonna lie this movie was absolutely amazing also if im being completely honest i went in assuming it would be another highly overrated superhero movie that couldnt like up to the hype it definitely wouldnt be the first time i disagreed with the critics boy was i mistaken outside of the films from christopher nolans dark knight trilogy this is easily the best superhero movie ever made they plot developed perfectly the action sequences were incredible there were a lot of unexpectedly humorous scenes and dialogue and the characters and actors were all great one of my concerns going in was how they would possibly give each character their fair shake well the great joss whedon did a great job keeping a perfect balance between staying true to the individual characters while further introducing a developing black widow and hawkeye another thing mark ruffalo did a marvelous job as bruce banner a lot of people were worried about him in that role and were upset about the change from edward norton maybe its because im biased and loathe norton but i thought ruffalo did a better job as banner i wouldnt have minded them focusing a little more time on the hawkeye character and i wouldnt have minded if they actually squeezed in natalie portmans character for a quick scene or two but the movie really didnt need it i just think if you can put portman on screen you put portman on screen lol i also wouldnt have minded if they focused a bit more on the villainous pawns and where they come from but i have a feeling well find out more about them in the following sequels so i cant be too upset about that all in all if you like superhero movies action movies or just kick ass movies in general you should like this movie too,fantasy
this movie is the absolute reason i go to the theaters in hopes that a film will be made this well and be entertaining to boot i had figured this would be a good movie but when i saw it i was blown away the characters were spot on each having the right roles in the movie another thing is this movie made me laugh it was witty at just the right moments ever character defending earth in their own way the story was good plot was good as well i can only give this movie a 10 i would give it an eleven but you know i have to stay withing the rules is this the best movie every made well everyone is different so probably not to everyone but if you do watch this movie and dont like it you really should check your pulse to see if your even alive cause its just plain awesome,fantasy
amazing incredible fantastic awesome is what i would call this film very very few plot holes in fact i only saw one which i wasnt sure if it was so i wont mention this film took years too make  by god it shows it its in the top 3 cgi films of all time my top 3 would be terminator 2 close encounters of the third kind 2012if you are reading my review  come this far then i thank you for taking your time one simple way to enjoy this film if you are going to the cinema is do not watch it in 2d watch it in 3d if you can have some food  dont sit at the back  enjoy the film it really is something else  a time when the movie makers are struggling they bring this blockbuster out on a serious note it wouldnt surprise me if this became the best box office takings of all time,fantasy
this is the movie of the year it has a really good plotand the heroes are really awesome iron man is cool as he always is thor was surprising me with his fight with iron man captain america is the most brave one and leader but he was kind of lame the green giant was a beast one of the awesome moments in the movie is when the green giant hits loki so bad another one is when in the end of the movie iron man flies to the space throw the bomb and then surprisely make it to earth worth the money of the ticket and even more i recommend you all to go and see this movie definitely one of the best movies of my life,fantasy
if you ask me making a superhero movie easy  why well the whole formula of a super hero facing a mad man who wants to take over the world then hero saves earth with some fancy effects and you have a movie but it is not an easy task to impress people or make them to take the movie seriously in my opinion the two main films that succeeded in making a revolution in the superhero category movies are the new dark knight franchise which took things 2 the next level with their deep messages and this movie is one of these movies that will leave an impact for a long time the cast is perfect a strong script and kick ass direction  the story is really interesting it was fresh it wasnt boring at all not just another hey we saved the world yay nop it made me feel like i was fighting with them yes we saved the world i dont know how to describe it all i can say is that the script was really good and it will make you excited i love aliens so i was excited  the cast is perfect these guys were like peanut butter and jam m which is one of the main reasons that the film succeeded with out the perfect cast this movie would be average tom hiddleston is a genius i love his role he was perfect he played his role well as for robert downey jr this guy is damn awesome every time the movie gets really serious he comes in and lighten up the mood m the rest of the cast were really awesome kudos 2 all of them   the direction was really good the effects were awesome and not corny perfect job  this movie proves that by the right cast direction and script you could make a respectful not just another superhero movie this movie was a dream movie 4 most of us and damn im lucky enough 2 be alive 2 c it i was really excited and when i came out of the cinema i got more excited awesome movie if you didnt c it then go,fantasy
if you have been a fan of the core marvel studios films since 2008s iron man where the beginnings of the initiative were first teased and carried through into the 2010 sequel as well as the incredible hulk thor and captain america the first avenger then the will not disappoint in fact it very well might make you question why the other franchise films werent as good as this fast paced funny superhero showdownmarvel has been very focused and dedicated with the development of its properties under the disney banner  and they no doubt wish that the spiderman and xmen franchises could return to their fold as it was the success of these earlier films that brought marvel comics out of bankruptcy  and has been providing solid entertainment from its creators and stars alike by odins beard sir kenneth branagh directed thor enter joss whedon who created a weekly tv show in buffy the vampire slayer that was a nearperfect example of a liveaction comic book to deliver a heavilyanticipated yet soeasytofail production of getting such a diverse character set in a movie that worked and worked it didthe film gets off to a slow and even somewhat murky start as loki thors mischievous halfbrother played with a anthony hopkinsworthy sneer by tom hiddleston appears escapes from and is responsible for the destruction of a shield hq as well as the spiriting away of a few supporting characters including stellan skarsgards dr selvig also of thor and jeremy renners hawkeye getting the full movie treatment here all under the semiimpotent glare of samuel l jacksons oneeyed spy nick fury obiously loki never saw samuel ls wallet from another filmthe movie picks up with the reintroduction of scarlett johanssons black widow as whedon has some fun showing what moves he could have presented in buffy if he had ansized budget backing him up but it truly gets bright when the three protagonists iron man captain america thor finally appear and of course get into a wrestling match to prove who has the biggest repulsorshieldhammer once the team finally assembles insanity and the hilarity that often follows ensues oh and mark ruffalo proves that the hulk can indeed smashjoss whedons adept skills he also writes the screenplay prove to be the other superhero powerhouse as he successfully created a production that pleases the hardcore fanboy who is aware of thanos the mainstream movie audience who thinks that tony and pepper are destined for each other and his own loyal core fan base of browncoats each hero gets their own time to shine in situations worthy of a comicbook splash page the roughup dustup of a third act that entirely deals with the assembled team involved in a streetlevel brawl in nyc against what else an invading alien army could very well have became tedious as admittedly the obligatory interstellar menace is faceless forgettable and seemingly invented for the sales of action figures but the action humor and allure of these powerful heroes is truly something unique and that magic is perfectly captured on the screen2008 saw the release of both iron man and warner bros dark knight the result was that both films set the bar that future genre films would have to follow in 2012 that bar was set yet again what remains to be seen is if the upcoming dark knight rises film as well as the sequels for iron man thor and captain america will continue to raise that bar or if they will all just assemble,fantasy
plenty of action lots of humor heroes you root forwell this film has it all admittedly i adore robert downey jr love the romantic interaction between iron man and pepper and really like mark ruffalo so this didnt hurt and speaking of mark ruffalo and his hulk characteri have to admit for a few minutes of thinking what the heck good is this as a super hero all he does is get mad and smash things what kind of help is this and of course this being a proper super hero movie the hulk eventually becomes useful rather than simply destructive and clears up most of those doubts and in all honesty what exactly does captain america do except for reflecting things off his shield that is or am i getting too picky here possibly so all in all i found it to be exactly what one would want when going to see a marvel super hero movieincluding the setup at the end with a hint for a further adventure go super heroes assemble,fantasy
like many people who have been fast forwarding the credits to see the teasing snippet at the end in the iron man films thor captain america etc i was ridiculously excited to see this film ill hold my hands up now and admit that i am a huge scifi nerd and regard thor and iron man 1 as two of my favourite ever films along with titles such as the recent star trek or the lord of the rings trilogy needless to say i was not disappointed this film was theres only one way to put this incredible the special effects were out of the world literally the best effects i have ever seen on a larger scale than the most recent transformers film but less in your face and over powering the effects were first rate completely seamless and is definitely something to watch on the big screen rather than wait for the dvdi found that the acting was really good as well everyone pulling their weight with a big nod towards tom hiddleston who i believe was one of the stars of the show definitely the best hulk there has ever been and chris hemsworth was utterly fantastic needless to say robert downey jr will deserve all the plaudits he takes from this film as he was brilliant as always in his role of tony stark even scarlett johansson who many assumed would just be token bo was really good and her character had surprising depththis is one of those films where you cant help but smile while watching it as you follow an incredible story line while witnessing faultless special affects i cannot recommend this film enough i have seen it once at the cinema and have already booked tickets to go see it again the phrase a must see has not been as relevant since lord of the rings peoplego see this film,fantasy
it is the film to watchthis movie is the best ever superhero film i have ever seen i was expecting a michael bay style movie with nothing but cgi but there is so much more to flashing lights in this movie unlike transformers 23the character clash worked really well as some scenes included just the heroes communicating and interacting the characters were all brilliant with a superb cast eg downey jr but the actor that stood out the most was none the less than mark ruffalo where has he been all this time this guy fits so well into the clothes of bruce banner as he really portrays the human and the scientific side of the hulk he also shows the battle with him self that he is constantly fighting the hulk in this movie was expectedlets be honest to be a side character instead he was a beast no better the hulk i also liked how lou ferigno makes his cameo as the voice of the hulk as for the rest of characters such as iron mancaptain america and thor they all shared really equally big roles black widows character is not only the pretty face but an extremely shrewd woman perfect woman or is it just me hawkeye the last character like we all expected draws the short straw but not as short as you would expect as he is seen doing some amazing stuff the antagonist loky has a great impact in the movie as the contrast of characters between him and thor tony stark and the rest escalates the tension to breaking pointthe film adopts a light hearted feel at times which smooths the film with some light humour the visuals were incredible especially with the hulk transformation finnally we get to see that and the battlesi would suggest watching iron man iron man 2 thor the incredible hulk and the first avenger find out the order on imdb before you watch the remember if you have not gone cinema to watch it yet stay till the very endunfortunately for me i think i know how 2 is going to end to find out my imaginary ending search up spider man 1994 episode 57 i am not a geeknerd and i just really like super heroes,fantasy
as expected is an excellent movie the movie shows the efforts of marvel studious from the beginning to the end the movie is full of adventure and action i was waiting for the movie since 1 year and when it released i was so eager to see the movie excellent graphics and special effects the fun element is not missing in the movie although serious and adventurous movie never misses any chance to have some fun all the superhumans are so cool iron man is always in funny mood but performs his duties seriously captain america has awesome leading qualities hulk is just suuuuperb a giant who is also a wild killer thor is ultimate fighter even he can handle hulk for some time shocked hawk eye and black widow although common human beings contribute their best for the team everyone must watch this movie never seen such a great movie i give it 1010,fantasy
movie review the 2012 by daredevilkidddkmy rating 8510yes oh boy did this movie deliver its like all the cogs fitted perfectly in a well oiled mechanism director joss whedon has made a brilliant transition from the small to the big screen the director has delivered a classic actionadventure film of epic proportions and this was no little achievement considering all the legendary characters of folklore mostly possessing their individual blockbusters  some really good and some plain mediocre  which were amalgamated into one huge vistaall the superheroes  even the supervillain merge into the plot beautifully and appear exactly at the opportune moments even a somewhat throwaway hero like black widow scarlett johansson feels vital her fight scenes are buffy cool hemsworth and evans are more relaxed more comfortable in their spandex skin if theres an underused super its hawkeye jeremy renner but in the last act he impresses toobut the true standout is the hulk mark ruffalos bruce banner pulls off the trick of allowing his inner rage to simmer just below the surface the whole time and when the green dude shows up stand back and just enjoy hes the first version of hulk to make his burst of power feel so gratifying his destructive nature is infectious also an honorable mentions have to bestowed upon robert downey jrs iron man  chris hemsworths  hes really growing with each passing film  thor who adequately support mark ruffalo and his alterego throughout the moviethe looks great the reportedly 250 million budget is on the screen many scenes have a great deal of variety not just well choreographed action theres a cleverness to the very idea to many of the scenes whedon pushes his heroes to their limits when your script can put demigod thor in peril thats incrediblethe plot is simple yet effective  thors evil brother loki tom hiddleston  a slimy megalomaniac has taken a cube called the tesseract that harnesses limitless energy and aliens from another dimension intend to invade earth to get it its easy to follow and merges well into the narration to let the film deliver what audiences really want to see  these ultimate superheroes becoming a team and kicking much buttthe action is magnanimous the cgi effects are dazzling but ushered only when required great and witty oneliners are interspersed intermittently the humor is enthralling the setpieces are brilliant each character is painstakingly developed the narration is crisp and finally but most importantly the action makes sense  a rarity for action adventure movies nowadays  in a way that you follow each minutest detail even while its bursting on screen at the rate of knots the action occurs only after enough plot and character detailing and even when it occurs it smoothly takes the plot forward this rare feat elevates whedon as the real superhero of this filmthe reminds us of the reason we love movies ant buy tickets for admittance in a cinema hall it will keep drawing you back for more as viewing it just once is insulting and will leave you just plain unsatisfied the euphoria you experience after completing this exalting visual odyssey will settle only after many long hours and then the realization will ultimately dawn  that you have been privileged to witness an classic that will be indelibly etched in cinematic archives,fantasy
like bilbos onehundredeleventh birthday party the is a longawaited event after four not counting hulk major features on the ensemble of heroes which grossed a mindboggling aggregate box office in excess of 2 billion dollars well over half of which coming from the two editions of iron man the main plot is rather simple and familiar a earth is fighting for its very survival against alien invasions and b there is an objectdevice of immense power sought by one and all good guys as well as bad guys assembling the ensemble of six is quite a challenge before we examine how cleverly this is done lets try to catalogue the protagonists how about into 3 groups least human are thor and hulk early in the movie just before his first appearance a cryptic remark is made about thor to the effect of something like he is basically a god hulk remains human but only until the other guy a term used repeatedly by our hero himself takes over next come the six million dollar man category human with so much done to their body that they become sort of superhuman iron man and captain america finally there are black widow and hawkeye altered ego of green arrow of the other camp the jla nick furys special agents who are one hundred percent human but trained to so excel in combat that they are almost superhuman the villains are quite unimpressive serving as punch bags for our heroes who provide vastly better entertainment by fighting among themselves lets see how cleverly this achieved by a plot that is nowhere near being convoluted and yet delightfully unformulaicwhile everything evolves around nick fury whose brainchild the is assembling of the team is mesmerizing providing plenty of opportunities for fights among the heroes almost from the first minute hawkeye defects to villain loki who wields a braincontrol device black widow succeeds in persuading hulk to join but only as a research scientist not a superhero they consider the other guy more a monster than a hero captain america technically over 100 years old is revived from his deep freeze while iron man is led into furys scheme much earlier on off screen almost like his partner soon after iron man with captain americas assistance subdues loki part of the villains cunning plot thor who seems to have materialized out of nowhere claims his brother for a prisoner setting off an exciting bout with iron man eventually stopped by captain americas mediation at furys headquarter an invisible flying aircraft carries  this you will have to see for yourself five of the six assemble with loki in captivity the villains plot is to have the defected sixth hawkeye come to his rescue and destroy his captors he tries very close to succeeding to manipulate the team members different personalities to set them against each other even more damaging loki thinks is a provocation to bring out the other guy unleashing hulks destructive power it seems to work initially the attack led by defected hawkeye provokes the appearance of green monster hulk the ensuing combat between the physically two most powerful hulk and thor is something to behold while this one is sheer brutal force the fight between the two special agents is a show of beautiful yet lethal combat techniques the result hawkeye breaks out of the brain control to which he has been subjected and comes back to his senses as well captain american and iron man whose personality conflict has been the biggest obstacle to their cooperation finally work together as a teamso in the last hour of the movie while loki brings out his alien army down on to manhattan the are finally cemented as a team as you see in the most publicized trailer shot with the camera circling them in an undaunted spirit of solidarity ready to face whatever enemy that dares to come to earth this movie must be seen at least twice the first time you are dividing your attention between following the story and watching the action only in the second time can you fully enjoy the excellent dialogue rare for an action movie which will be several times more meaningful than this first at the same time you are able to sit back and fully enjoy the action robert downey jr chris evans and chris hemsworth reprise their respective characters adding a delightful new dimension on personality conflicts all this is done mostly through crispy witty dialogue scarlett johansson and jeremy renner who has made brief and briefer appearances respectively in iron man and thor franchises bring more complete realization to their respective character as well as a halftold story of their past relationship which strongly suggests a spinoff prequel last but certainly not least is mark ruffalo whose softspoken lowkey interpretation of hulk gets two thumbs up from meand of course there are all the others samuel l jacksons nick fury clark greggs agent phil coulson and tom hiddlestons loki need no introduction and not even reminders from iron man comes gwyneth paltrows pepper potts and from thor comes stellan skarsgards erik selvig two more familiar faces for a welcomed new face is cobie smulders agent maria hill,fantasy
it was a surprise that i actually liked marvels the my expectations were a film about a bunch of superheroes exercising their powers for the sheer amusement of the comicbook fans indeed i was right about the exercise of power naturally enough but the way such showingoff was employed is what i like about the film while on the surface the events may seem to revolve about a group of mentally immature superheroes there are several references to a deeper meaning presented in a hilarious light way with focus on both action and dialogue alikethe undertone found in the has to do with the current universal trend of freedom and rebels loki makes it clear that his purpose is to fix the problem which earth inhabitants have of misunderstanding the meaning of freedom claiming they are made to be ruled also there is an indirect mention of fallen regimes in general and particularly the fall of the soviet union though this subject is not dealt with depth it gives some weight to the light nature of the film a film about superheroes is not expected to tackle serious issues but at the same time films whose main aim is to entertain the viewer should still not be an embodiment of triviality as is the case in many comedies of the last few yearsthis is delivered through a balance between action and dialogue the film is actionpacked like a superhero film should be though this does not come at the expense of dialogue action sequences are supported by the amazing cgi with a special nod to the resemblance between dr banner and the hulk dialogue similarly plays an important role in the development of events and the relationship between the characterswittily this is coated with a fair amount of good humour though some jokes could be predictable the spontaneity of the performances makes them unarguably funny for example towards the end when rogers is giving orders to policemen what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves nonverbal humour even mounts to a point when viewers clapped hard  when dr banners other guyshut loki up with a slight movement of his huge armssuch elements gather in the end to make a film that successfully transcends the circle of comicbook fans delivering one of the best films of the season,fantasy
this review will not contain any spoilers i want those of you who have not seen the to have the same experience i had when i saw the film to put any spoilers in this review would be unfair to those who have not seen the you probably wouldnt believe me anyway i went into this film with very high expectations something that has never happened to me before happened when i saw the the film exceeded my already high expectations i remember the very end of the first iron man when samuel l jackson appeared as nick fury then robert downey jr appeared as tony stark at the end of the incredible hulk samuel l jackson was back and nick fury in iron man 2  at the very he end of iron man 2 we saw thors hammer samuel l jackson appeared as nick fury in thor at the end of thor we saw capt americas shield in capt america samuel l jackson played nick fury connecting all 5 films featuring 4 of the greatest marvel comics superheroes of all time now tony stark iron man robert downey jr captain america steve rogers chris evans thor chris hemsworth and the hulk and bruce banner mark ruffalo are together in the nick fury played by samuel l jackson brings all these superheroes together along with black widow agent romanoff scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner im in agreement with some of the posters who said that the is the best comic book adaptation ever made the script was well written the cast gave master class performances no one else could have portrayed these characters other than the actors who played them i was blown away by the special effects in the film i became a kid all over again watching this the this was an excellent movie you should do your family and yourself a favor and see the i guarantee you will not be bored,fantasy
this movie was so anticipated by me ever since i knew this was being made every marvelmovie being released before this one was watched by me knowing that every superhero would play a part in this movie all the previous movies beginning from the incredible hulk still with edward norton were a prelude a sort of prequel to this big setup and what a movie this is what i call movie history being made the story lines of all the other movies iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor  captain america the first avengerall come together which would make it hard to watch if you havent seen any of the previous movies especially the iron man and thorfilms go watch this movie enjoy it savour it it is marvellous incredible and i enjoyed every single moment in this 25 hour during movie this gets a 1010 for story for excitement for acting for music for directing a true actionpacked movie and i loved it,fantasy
ten out of teni along with my friend went to watch this movie on the basis of imdb reviews and boy  the reviews didnt disappoint us why i was not having too much expectations on this movie  1 6 heroes  its very difficult to give enough screen time to all of them and at the same time keep the pace of the movie as well spider man 3 was a classic example of this goof up 2 was concerned about the mega villain 3bad reactions on the casting of mark ruffalo as hulk 4 lately a lot of super hero movies were flops or average green lantern  iron manbut now i would definitely ask you all to watch this movie coz  1 the movie has cleverly given the screen time to everybody 2loki made a tough villain to beat alone 3 everybody loved mark and as well as the hulk 4 timing of the funny moments were spot on 5technologically good as par with avatar and transformer 3 6 the best super hero movie out now with batman series 7 will be enjoyed by a 10 year old kid to a 60 year old man i am 30 and my friend is 38 8 can be enjoyed in 2d as wellwaiting for 2 ,fantasy
i had absolutely no hope of this one making it big the second i took my seat boy was i proved wrong by many a mile theres a reason this is only the second super hero movie in the top 250 coz its worth it periodi was absolutely glued right from the first minute it was an awesome mixture of highend action drama suspense thrill humor and love ok maybe not love who would want that in a super hero movie anywayiron man was at his brutal best whether it was tactics word play narcissism or just plain old explosive action he just did not disappoint if you thought iron man only did solo you are in for a surprisei thought hawkeye and the black widow were going to be just another pair of dummies not they are as much a part of the story as the rest of them be prepared for some of their cool moves man does scarlett look stunning when she is beating the hell out of the bad guys hawkeye might have done way better with a gun but what the hell to each his own thor and cap america the demigod and the strategist with the awessssome weapon and shield combo totally kicked buttask lokis horde perhaps there was little the captain could do with just his shieldand the best for the last for those who had lost all hopes of hulk ever entertaining them this one changes it all he is now my favorite today what raw madness ask loki this time hulk gives it all with a pinch of humor that we have missed in the previous two moviesthe first half was built around bringing all the superheroes together and setting up the story line without deviating from the end plot the second half just blows you away joss whedon seems to have become a master artist when it comes to super cool dudes hes given each of the good guys an equal say in the movie with none in particular ruling the showin the end the 2 and a half hours of nonstop fun seemed to be way less and i was left craving for more   this summer is gonna be really hot folks and the just got the party started hoohaa go watch it,fantasy

there isnt really much plot going on here but what there is plenty of is character depth joss whedon does a fantastic job of giving these characters so many levels that we never knew they had this added depth to the characters really causes us too feel for them in their moment of hardships the character i ended up empathising for the most was actually black widow which actually surprised me a great deal but thats thing that whedon does really well he is used to developing characters and yet again his fantastic writing does it again here now if you had your doubts about joss whedons directing ability then let me reassure you that you can put those fears to bed some of the shots he creates are absolutely stunning making for what will be some very iconic scenes from the movie not only did joss whedon direct this action filled roller coaster he also put pen to paper and wrote it as i said the plot isnt exceptional but the dialogue is utter brilliance every word out of tony starks mouth is absolutely hilarious making this funnier than a lot of comedies i have seeneveryone knows the standard of the acting that is typically found in these marvel movies its pretty good but nothing really amazing robert downey jr obviously returns as the obnoxious and downright funny billionaire tony stark everyone has seen this role before so you dont really see anything new here but you know what that doesnt mean it hasnt gotten old as usual robert downey jr performs brilliantly displaying one of the best performances of the movie adding some comedy to an otherwise action filed adventuredowney jr isnt the only one that shines here mark ruffalo  who i am a huge fan of  plays bruce banner the hulk brilliantly making for my personal favourite hulks we have seen to date and there is nothing i wish more than for him to get his own movie after this but we all know that isnt going to happen ruffalo also supplies us with many laughs throughout the movie and he also gives us a collection of the best action sequences in the whole movie with his hulk smashwe see the return of tom hiddleston as the menacing loki and he plays the role absolutely beautifully the first shot we get of loki is harrowing which is mastered by the combination of hiddlestons devilish performance and whedons gorgeous directing loki not only makes for a horrifying villain but his chemistry between downey jr as iron man is priceless if you werent fond of loki in thor  like i wasnt  your mind will be changed here he truly is an evil person making for an iconic villainchris evans and hemsworth show us the performance you expect from seeing them in their individual marvel movies they arent show stopping but are good enough for this movie i feel as though the best moments of acting are when all of the are together the chemistry between them is perfect they all have their own different relationship between each other that can swap from hatred to best friends in a matter of minutesnow the one thing that you dont have to worry about in this movie is any of the main characters being pushed aside when i first saw the trailer i thought that this will end up being iron man  co but trust me it isnt all of the characters you want to get all the screen time they deserve maria hill played by the brilliant cobie smulders is one of the very few characters that gets pushed to the side but she was never really regarded as one of the main characters although i would have liked it if she had a bit more ass kicking to do pepper potts played by gwyneth paltrow makes a brief appearance which literally lasts a minute but you dont really care about that as this movie really isnt about herthe isnt exactly perfect there was one thing i wasnt too fond of and that is that these movies are starting to feel far too familiar apart from the stature of this movie in comparison with others it doesnt really vary its self from the other marvel movies  paramount pictures  the direction has the same old comic book action style which you can spot in all the other movies this isnt necessarily a bad thing but i can see many people starting to tire of iti feel as though it is usually useless and extremely overpriced the same can be said here i didnt feel as though the 3d was necessary if it was it would have been filmed in 3d and not post converted like most films are these day the 3d wasnt used like avatar to fully engross me in the world it just felt like it was there and there was nothing really too it i know i would have enjoyed the film just as much in 2dthe thing the does best is what it set out to do it isnt trying to be a dark superhero movie with a serious tone  like the dark knight  and thats good because trying to compete with that is a ridiculous thing to do the tries to be a comic book actionfilled hollywood blockbuster and you know what it does that perfectlytrust me if you are a fan of superhero movies then you will fall in love with this movie it is the movie we all wanted and expected joss whedon has done us all proud and for that i would like to him thank you very much this is the perfect start to a summer filled with brilliant moviesif you enjoyed you can

the critics so far are basically right about what makes it great virtually all of the reviewers have said it has excellent dialogue and great action set piecesno one who is a fan of fantasy action movies could seriously deny how good this is as an action spectacle the special effects are very good and put to good use by whedon and his team the tracking shot through the midst of the final battle is amazing the finale is a genuine classic battle scene and is as good as anything that steven spielberg would have put together in the same circumstancesthe movie is funny enough that imdb should add comedy to its genre list and all the other things the critics are repeating so far anyway are true mostly good acting ruffalo is especially good as banner character interactions are done very well everyone gets enough to do that it feels like an ensemble movie all of the title characters from the prior films are portrayed as well or better than in their own films blah blah blahso all the good stuff weve been hearingreading is basically true what about the bad theres less consensus around the bad but probably general agreement that the plot as such isnt all that its basically the story as told on the cover of the comic 1 a team of powerful but not unstoppable individuals gather together to fight a foe no hero could stop alone as time outs reviewer noted the plot is basically just a coathanger for whedon to build his character arcs and action sequences but the was always likely to be limited by the need to be an origin story of sorts and so i wasnt really expecting a lot more from the plot on this occasion and the storytelling itself is very good the way the character arcs were moved forward and entwined was done very well the alien army was an adequate but not very innovative way to get loki reinforcements and get a big battle for the heroes at the climaxthe beginning was a bit clunky several reviewers have used exactly that word and i dont think it was a very helpful way to get audiences who hadnt seen the buildup movies into the filmthere are potentially interesting themes of control power and freedom as patrick samuel touched on in his review at static mass emporium but these are not given sufficient fleshing out leaving the movie in the summer blockbuster category albeit a much much better than average example of that kindoh and ill say it again the official title is stupidbut overall id give it a 910 probably a 7 to 8 for those who havent read the comics or followed the movie franchise closely,fantasy
this film was dreadful it was certainly action packed with an onslaught to the senses reminiscent of a roller coaster ride but lasting two hours 23 minutes the dialogue consisted of half a dozen very shallow characters trying to sound cool which means for robert dj that he was mumbling incoherently for half of his lines the story was so predictable  overcome overwhelming odds by gritting your teeth stamping your foot or banging your hammer just that little bit harder but let us take a moment to mourn the sad demise of the extraordinary talent of superhero joss whedon who will be remembered for buffy and firefly but not if were generous for this abomination so what have i learned from this experience that imdbs scoring system has been compromised and cant be trusted  88 is ridiculous,fantasy
in order to understand the situation of my review ill clear some things up i saw this on a regular movie screen no 3d and no imax so maybe i wasnt fully engrossed in this film due to the medium i chose to view it in but lets cut the crap if a movie needs images popping at your face every other 30 seconds and imax sized screens to be totally awesome bruh it was never that solid to begin with that being said lets analyze the film shall we so here is the main problems with the as a whole it relies too much action with too little meaning what did i expect though right well i expected something a little less cookie cutter than thisif transformers is a bad movie which it is and far worse than this for lacking fan service of its original audience to connect to the is stunningly mediocre for the exact opposite reason god bless the man or woman that enters the theater with no prior knowledge of every superhero movie released in the last 7 years because all this film contains is fan service upon fan service there is nothing organic about this film and it shows in spades everything and everyone is merely glazed over waiting for there 12 minutes of solo screen time no risks are taking and there is so much star wars prequelsequse action going on that it kills any tension you might have the film almost runs 150 minutes 100 of which are unnecessary fights between the bad guys and good guys or the good guys and the other good guys not gelling as a team its just an obvious filmthe isnt irredeemable though it has some solid performances particularly colby slomders of how i met your mother fame proves she can probably take a stab at being an action heroine on her own project and mark ruffalos take on the hulk impressed me the action sequences while over abundant are masterfully crafted and the comedy is surprisingly what works the best in this film with several witty one liners strewn through out the filmat the end of the day i think the film was too much bang and not enough buck as i was leaving a gentlemen was talking to his wife and said i thought there would be a lot less talking my inner monologue rebutted wanna just watch stock footage of things getting blown up and punched but this is what it is if you are a fan of superhero movies youll probably love this if you are fan of things that blow up and implode youll probably love this too fans of focused films with a little more story and character development maybe a risk or two being taken will probably feel the same way i do about itmy one sentence summary of the 2 and half hours of nonspecific escapism i that sounds like something you like which there is no shame in then i recommend it if not id pass or wait for a rental510,fantasy
i think this movie was made for 16yearolds whove never heard of the word hegemony who just want hulk to rescue iron man without understanding what motivates his change of heart towards tony stark or who see nothing wrong with shots concentrating on scarlett johanssons butt and dont understand the inner conflict of the charactersthe film tries to use humour and action sequences to gloss over poor story development poor character choices and action sequences that really dont propel the story or characters forward but that seem to happen for their own sakeon the plus side there are some very clever witty lines especially from tony stark but theyre a wasted opportunity to explore thor and lokis relationship more which was set up so well in the thor movieunfortunately the movie is full of so many clichs that you see them coming a mile away theres also a lot of cringeworthy dialogue trying to sound profound  if thats not bad enough the film has no heart something that the 1st iron man and thor movie had in spadesthere was a clear arch with the characters  we knew what their pain is and what they needed to get by the end of the film the in this movie are paper cutouts with no depththeyre almost parodies of themselves and this is very obvious with hulk vs bruce banner which is a pity because the animated series on sabc 3 currently shows how interesting the character dynamics can be without sacrificing what makes each character tickhere i didnt feel anything for the characters i didnt care whether they live or die or get anything new that we havent seen in their past incarnation instead i was bombarded by dumb 1980s drivel about how we need big brother america and right is might mentality  ja nee  actually the film is more about how america sees itself and what it thinks a notsosubtle indoctrination into why we need team america world police this time in form of theits a pity that a movie with no proper character development a story with no build its actually a throwback to a time were escapist films were far removed to anything resembling peoples lives values or a smart comment on our times will make millions until people realize that the emperor is naked like they did with spiderman 3well if you want a movie where you will check out your brain at the door and watch things explode then this movie is for you if you want to laugh in short bursts in between then this movie is for you but if you want an action movie that will move you i suggest your rent iron man 1 and thor instead,fantasy
went to sneak of tonight in austin and wish i hadnt wasted the couple hours or so very disappointing wish i had sold or given away the passes i remember a time where the story was the most important part of the movie instead of just smart quips and cgi explosions to make up for it i guess it is all about making a quick buck hey lets put all these elements together and make a killing off the rubes thing is we will accept lower and lower quality films and have no one to blame but ourselves dont like silly cars that turn into metallic aliens anyone i would wait for hbo or the like if you must see this on a very related subject who are the morons in marketing who decided that they should overbook a sneak so a good third of passes are turned away from the angrydisappointed faces on the adults and kids who were leaving i am wondering how all the bad will generated helps promote a film they should barely over book by say 1 so that people with lives arent at the mercy of slackers who sit around all day with nothing else going on but to sit all day grade c for movie and promotion,fantasy
i was hoping that this film would be just as exciting and involving as the super hero films i have seen over the last 12 years  xmen x2 spiderman 1  2 batman begins the dark knight iron man  i could watch them and really enjoy them time and time again  but this one  it just didnt do it for me im not sure why but even with the 3d effect  to be honest didnt make much difference until the final battle sequence  but even then it was few and far between i think this film was too loud and infantile and tried too hard to sound sophisticated and too much technical talk  was that supposed to sound impressive there were a few funny bits especially with the hulk but on the whole the film just dragged on without a real purpose  i hope the supposed sequel will be much better,fantasy
preendgame mcu rewatch everything works in this film the initial gathering of heroes the animosity and discord between the various characters in part amplified by loki the chemistry between stark and banner coulson fanboying all over cap and the eventual bonding together for a common cause i feel like everyone is bringing their agame here ruffalo stepping in for norton and doing an excellent jobthe story and pacing is good and even the action scenes are not confusing a la transformers and really spotlight every single hero and their unique abilities their interaction and teamwork is great the only nitpick i could have is caps costume still looks a bit outdated even with the upgrade just reminds me of that really bad 90s movie,fantasy
the only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema and instead go in expecting some cool action hot chicks and a few wisecracksin this endeavor it succeeds fairly well it is in fact almost nonstop action and it flows well for this purpose theres hardly a moment of relative boredom or dullness and it keeps your attention throughout pacing is something many films have trouble with and this does it wellthe special effects and sound editing were very welldone too not once did i think they were overdone or cheesylookingsounding and they packed a punch the way the aliens looked was neat and most of the fighting was cool to watch what sticks out in my memory is thor hitting his hammer against captain americas shield an awesomely done scene for effectsthe humorous oneliners mostly stemming from tony stark but also from the camaraderie among the group also work well enough and keep you at least smiling throughouthowever i sensed a strong amount of cold calculated filmmaking here i felt almost no style in this entire film and instead i felt as if joss whedon had a quota to fill as he was filming it its almost as if he was thinking i need to show what happens during the following encounters thor vs captain america thor vs iron man iron man vs loki etc and then later on many combinations of two or three of the fighting bad guys together to contrast their earlier conflicts i appreciate the contrast that went into that aspect but it just felt plain robotic the way it was executed the thought pattern i detected was you damn well cant have an movie without this happening and this and the result of this is that this quota took the focus and actually enticing filmmaking was put on the backburner he was simply showing things happening with entirely no flair or style of direction whatsoever oh look heres iron man coming in to save the day hes going to say something funny dont we know it nothing stylish unexpected or cinematic happens in this entire film it left a dry taste in my mouth despite all the cool effects and fightingthe story along with the direction was very milquetoast and forgettable to briefly summarize loki an alien comes down to earth to wreak havoc the team up and stop him and all the aliens he summons through a giant portal as well youd think nick fury being the leader of the would take on a more interesting storyline role but he really doesnt i was maniacally uninterested in every single scene with him talking to the heads of shield and beyond that his storyline doesnt really go many places in this film in fact all the other individual character storylines didnt really go anywhere either which is okay since this film was a group effort but the overall group storyline was not very interesting either basically another rendition of saving the planet therefore neither the overarching group storyline nor the individual storylines were very fulfilling leaving the story as a whole lackingthe script was also extremely dry and poorly written i feel this was another item that went on the backburner to give the aforementioned quota more focus most of the lines were very uninteresting and without character one example that stuck out in my mind is nick fury saying ill bet you 10 youre wrong people may say this phrase in reality its not the realism about it i attack but the character and flair of it this is a movie when characters speak they should be saying things that are somewhat relevant interesting mysterious gripping funny or any combination thereof something that delivers something with edge or character most of the lines in the entire film i have completely forgotten already except ones like the above that i remembered just to point out how uninteresting they are just like with the direction i felt as if the script too just had people saying things to move the story along very sparsely was any extra style or flair or character added inlast but entirely not least is the acting and overall i was disappointed ill start with the good robert downey jr was his usual funny smartass self and i have no complaints nor was he exceptional i also actually quite enjoyed chris evans as captain america i find him a talented actor who works well in various kinds of films also scarlett johansson did a great job as usual i love stellan skarsgrd hes a great actor but i have to admit his placement in the film felt awkward and every time he came on screen i chose to express it through hysterical laughter samuel l jackson did a decent job as nick fury but i wasnt very impressed but i blame that on the script now for the bad the main villain of the film loki played by tom hiddleston was a terrible choice for the main villain of any film i mostly laughed at his scenes because of how bad his acting was when laughter was unintended the guy who plays thor chris hemsworth was not very good either in this film also mark ruffalo was a disappointment to see i dont mind his acting normally but it was just so noticeably inferior to edward nortons hulk that it has to count as a negativeto sum up good pacing special effects and some interesting encounters between certain characters do not save a film when it has weak direction a weak script a weak storyline mostly weak acting and most glaring of all it seemed very cold calculated and without style however i was at least mildly entertained,fantasy
perfect everything i wanted in a superhero film having all these characters whove been built up over the past five movies finally come together was amazing joss weddon did it and did it well all actors playing th amin were superb and loki us currently and im pretty sure will remain for a while one of the best villains in any one of these movies the best part was how different it was from any other marvel movie there were funny quips and retorts between a couple of the characters that added the comedic touch perfectly coulsons death was sad but it was the motivation needed for the team then the battle of manhattan was fought and let me just say it was awesome overall marvelously inpressed,fantasy
no spoilers here  all the characters were introduced so seamlessly youre like hey its spiderman or hey its that dude with wings from the end of the last ex men etc etc there were few things better done and more entertaining than introducing the guardians of the galaxy crew in that had some hilarious results i love the dr strangetony stark moments but you kinda knew they had to come bruce fighting with hulk was hilarious thanos is a great character and a way that unifies what all the teams are doing one of the highlights of the film has to be when peter dinklage shows up in well in the form he showed up in youll see it was delightful to see him and i heard at least 10 audible sighs of glee at seeing him groot and rocket hangin around with thor was hilarious saw a few people i didnt know but black panther and a few others ended up being cool too great job stan lee and jon favreau  cant wait to see the next one so many deaths in this one that i feel like we need a support group just to get us to the next one,fantasy

one would expect putting an all star cast  all in their best superhero roles you would have a conflict for acting supremacy but not this little bundle of superhero bliss shockingly enough they all worked great together and in perfect harmony well done to the writers and director for putting this one together in such a great manner im officially an fan a perfect 1010 from me,fantasy
it has finally happened marvel has done what has never been done before it has taken numerous franchises of its comics and brought them all together on the big screen and it was magnificent iron man thor the hulk shield and captain america have come together to form thethere was doubt about the hulk in this movie considering the two disappointments in the previous hulk movies but this was the greatest hulk in comparison to all previous hulks mark ruffalo who plays the role of dr bruce banner is a perfect match he really redefined the not only dr banner but also the hulk well done marvelthe drama between the heroes as the was forming was super but it was short lived the fight between iron man and thor was cool but it leaves a person wanting more later on the hulk and thor fought and it was awesome to see it on the big screen it was also a little short but it may have taken from the story if it were any longerthe battle in new york was incredible the hulk was funny with his smashing tactics there was one scene that was a single shot that led from one hero to the next across the city as each was fighting one of the villains the fighting sequences and the choreography that was put together in that shot was impressive and entertaining,fantasy
action action action effects effects effects action effects effects action action effects i dont know maybe i should give up on superhero movies or maybe marvel could put a little effort into giving them some meaning two and a half hours of stunning effects and breathtaking action great acting and directing interesting characters a few witty remarks but all together is kind of vain and pointless the plot didnt engage me i didnt relate to the characters and i couldnt care less what will happen to them there was no depth or point this is simply a couple of hours of superficial fun for those who have fun shutting their brains out i love the effects and the action and the adrenaline too but thats not enough for me i need the film to have a strong story and depth if i cant have both ill always pick a poorly filmed good story rather than superbly made nonsense still i have to admit that it is really powerfully filmed and within the genre i cannot go below810,fantasy

loved this movie ive been a marvel fan since the 1960s and it was a treat seeing all of my boyhood heroes on the big screen if you havent seen this one what are you waiting for,fantasy
as the first crossover mcu film you would hope it would be good it effectively combines multiple characters from previous films into a witty action filled adventure amazing scenes are littered throughout the movie and it makes for an attention keeping story the plot is easy to follow but doesnt really need to be considering this movie is not a story driven movie it takes characters you remember puts them in a setting you know faces them against a villain you remember and forces them to work together in a totally epic and occasionally hilarious manner it also contains a very heartwarming message not to mention really cementing the mcu as a force not to be reckoned with,fantasy
and that is all mostly due to all the previous ground work laid out by marvel studios pay attention warner bros this is how its done  in order for this to work some character development has to be put into place in the form of standalone movies giving the chance to each and every one of the teams member characters to shine and for us the audience to get to know them whether all these standalone movies have been up to snuff or not is irrelevant what it is relevant is that the audience has had a chance to know them and therefore care about what happens to them and in that this movie excells not only are all the characters given a chance to shine but it also shows what a talented group of crew members and director can achieve when all the stars align very well written story strong performances an epic score by alan silvestri stateoftheart special and visual effects and a very fast but not one bit rushed pace make this the best movie to date great entertainment,fantasy
a masterpiece of modern film making action packed incredible visual effects unforgettable characters great acting amazing on screen chemistry filled with subtle humor with impeccable comedic timing fantastically choreographed fighting scenes the list goes on and on a never before seen cinematic feat by marvel that brings together all of their previous movies and gives us a blockbuster that will hold a special place in movie history,fantasy
the first big liveaction superhero teamup movie the is a truly epic film there are many great fight scenes and a smart interesting villain the flaws in this movie are there because mcu producers are still experimenting with hero interactions and relationships,fantasy
this movie is amazing coming in with all the hype and expectations that it had and still managing to exceed them i will never forget the awe i was in when i saw this movie on its opening weekend the simple yet exciting story the comedic relief and the action sequences make this the golden standard for all super hero movies,fantasy
this movie is a perfect blockbuster with incredible pace great action sequences that grow bigger and better as the movie approaches its climax it also blends the fun action with fun dialogue between already established characters and by the end all the dynamic gets developed seamlessly it also presents a fun villain something thats going to be missed for a lot time in the mcu everybody gets time to shine a bit well maybe not hawkeye but i honestly dont care as i dont like jeremy renner and the movie manages to be kidfriendly without overdoing it and respecting the characters traitshaving said that there are some awful scenes loki vs iron manthen hulk is quite dumb for example some forced things hulk is always angry coulson fake death as motivation and rewatching it shows you a slightly less great 2nd act than the overall productstill the movie is an achievement in on itself and helped to change cinema for better to me maybe for worse for others which is something that few movies do,fantasy
the is a 2012 american superhero film based on the marvel comics superhero team of the same name produced by marvel studios and distributed by walt disney studios motion pictures now i want to review the avanger movie for the action and the visual effect are good the emotional of the storyline i think it is good enough but at the beginning the story is too fast and the ending is unclear but this movie is very amazing and didnt make me feel disappointed,fantasy
its ok really boring though not as good asmara everyone says im sorry but its not the opening scene is confusing and pointless and just has a dc universe like final fight scene,fantasy
an enjoyable movie with a great cast definitely give this a watch,fantasy
the takes its time assembling the full team for action and it pays off tremendously when the team comes together they have such an ecstatic chemistry with each other you watch in awe even when theyre just talking with each other each hero plays off the other so well and they all have a unique relationship with the other that helps tie the team together tony stark and captain america clash heads tony stark finds a new friend in bruce banner bruce banner has an awkward relationship with black widow and the hulk has a friendly rivalry with thor what helps tie the team together and solidify their authority is the score one of the best scores in the marvel universe and in film is the theme a classic piece of music that sticks in your head and it helps you weave an emotional connection to these characters the action is some of the best although the action is quite entertaining without being too much or too little some small portions of it feel a little underwhelming but the rest will give you goosebumps watching these characters come together from their separate movies forms quite the spectacle to behold it gives the movie a monumental atmosphere around the entire experience despite that a good chunk of the movie the cinematography can be kind of dull the dialogue between the team the action they serve out and the spectacle of a film that they exist in all comes together to form a memorable movie experience that lasers itself into your brain so you never forget it overall the is an extremely successful culmination of these heroes that delivers thrills comedy and some truly powerful moments that embed themselves in movie history so i give it an 88,fantasy
the first 45 minutes of the movie was slow but the final battle was one of the best in the mcu,fantasy
what do expect when the superheroes form a team a blast this is what happened in this movie this movie has a good screenplay along with sound graphics robert down jr chris evans and others have done well good entertainer and fantasy,fantasy
as far as marvel movies have gone in the past their history is eh sketchy at best but since the timeline bust its way into our screens they have undoubtedly grown and grown in cinematic splendour personally i believe everyone likes a well made buddy action movie and this is exactly that the marvel universe has made this feature in my mind essentially perfect containing mild feel good humour riviting story line well played roles by well loved actors absolutely mind blowing special effects and a jaw dropping goosebump inducing sense of nostalgia that links you directly to your youth irregardless of age or interest in the comic books themselves put it this way folks your kids will adore it and you will also,fantasy
5havent seen many superhero movies in recent memory hard to keep up with a marvel or dc flick coming out with the rhythm of one every month and a half so im honestly getting pretty annoyed with this genre the was one of the first to begin this endless stream and probably the first ensemble of superheroes to come out verdict  not good at all most of the characters are full of themselves and unbearable to watch in all their unpleasantness others are just useless ragdolls ive never felt even the slightest sign of danger or distress and the funny parts werent that funny the movie is just a big moving toy with no personality whatsoever,fantasy
here we have the the fiveyearold movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago the director and cowriter was joss whedon at that point mostly known for buffy and toy story the film that brought him an oscar nomination but now this one here is certainly his careerdefining work the era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and rdjs iron man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a marvel superhero allstars film thor and captain america of course have their own films now too but back to this one here hiddleston was still doing a good job and loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly some great potential this character has not a surprise at all whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy drama and action sequences most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end the only parts i did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the tony stark oneliner moments but thats also subjectivethis film was nominated for its special effects for a bafta and an oscar and lost both times to life of pi of course fitting the box office success it received many other honors during the awards season back then at slightly over 140 minutes it is a really long watch indeed and i think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2hourmark but i still take it as it is as there wasnt a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration back to the villain loki may have been the primary antagonist here but there is a lot more conflict in here most of all the managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause its a long way to that and when its finally done loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the other end of the universe as they were saying so what was the best thing here yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths and i am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here but also for example about the more subtle effects like what iron man sees written in his maskso yeah overall i think this was a good watch everybody will have their favorites from the cast but as the film is so long every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time for me these would be jackson renner and scarjo of course even if i must admit that sljs character did not do a whole lot for me in here its a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun its of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish but its still a success and not just in quality but also definitely from the commercial perspective no surprise number 3 is coming out soon still the imdb and rt ratings may be a bit too high to be honest nonetheless if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on imdb it really is high time to finally go check it out today was the second or third time i watched it and i think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch go for it especially if you like marvel films i give this first new film a thumbsup the character are really interesting and fun to watch not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes,fantasy
what i like1 the thrill of seeing the together was amazing the first time2 as usual downeys performance3 the actors for the most part do a good job4 i had nothing against the conflict and friendship with the groupwhat i didnt like1 a lot of the jokes dont hold up2 the thrill sort of dies off after a while3 the film is kind of boring these daysoverall the movie was amazing when it had come out and i will not argue that in the slightest but the reality is that it just does not do so anymore but there is nothing wrong with that although there is a part of me that wishes it didnt do that well since we wouldnt have had the much worse mcu movies in the future,fantasy
this is an example of a successful movie the successful movie is when you watch it breathtaking easy watching and yet this is a movie very hard to makethe hell of making such a movie is to write a handful of protagonists  each having a separate movie of their own  into a single movie where all of them should be main characters and equally a hell of a job yet of all movies including civil war this one is the best so this is one of the movies you wish it never ends but first i want to praise the role of cobie smulders she is very sexy and played her role of maria hill very and very sexy id very much like to have such a girlfriend in me life so the task was to make many episodes like video clips where each of the characters have single and impressive dialogue and acting then  to unite them all into a movie personally after watching it three times im a big fan of scarlett so first time i was all into her second time i watched it i liked the performance of tom hiddleston well this is a movie where all actors are just perfecttom  there is something ideal for him to take the role of loki you will never see him as a villain you will understand him and have compassion  this is what marvel is all about but today as i watched it the third time it was all about the connection about understanding about to be together strange but this third time i noticed the trust captain america tried to have to this team strange and unknown to him sacrifice iron man made their mutual partnership you know marvels movies are not about fun comics blockbuster they have a meaning this movie was about understanding and to be together despite all odds a dialogue between so different people and about not to be alone but to be together this is why i love marvel movies so much they have this humanity in it beauty of humanity in all of the rage of a blockbusterso today it is about thor still loving his half brother widow saving arrow iron man and captain working together hulk trying so much to be a good man he always is this is not thanks god just a superhero movie this a movie about understanding and god it ends too soon  the moviethank you marvel it is marvel the fairy tale not about heroes but about us,fantasy
loved this moviei saw this film on frebuary 17 but you know im not much a sciencefiction fan but i quite enjoyed this one he his pretty good and incrediblethe movie centers around a girl and his best friends the girl got a power and she has to live with and to use it properly the boy is an only child and he lost his mother in a car accident so he has to live with his widowed father gwendoline try to help his friend the best she can and a miracle appearsthe acting of the mains characters clara busin and pierre foliot was really great clara gives a beautiful and very convincing performance especially during the more emotional scenesthere were moments in the dreaming girl that were so intense that i barely breathe he is a gripping movie that will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions but its well worth the ride ,fantasy
the was directed by joss whedon and stars roberty downey jr chris evans and tom hiddlestickshiddleston if it actually bothers you its the end result of 5 previous movies combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the marvel cinematic universe when a charming likable british villain tries to attack earth with his giant disposable cgi space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one and thus we have a cinematic universe thanks feige your brilliance had doomed us all the is one of the most likable enjoyable fun actionsuperhero movies thats ever been released and redefined a genre without this movie all the cinematic universes we have today wouldnt existthe debate on whether thats good or not is still open and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted dont watch this movie expecting the dark knight or xmen because this movie centres fun as its 1 goal and excels at it all the cast is likable the action is fun and it is overall just a great big fun way to spend 2 hours of you lifeas much as i praise this movie it does have some flaws the main flaw is the dull generic and clich ridden story which is just really poorly written it follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have no stakes in marvel movies i will also say the ending should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so i would definitely say it should have been handled better the end credits sequences are gold thoughrobert downey jr is excellent as iron man and is easily the best part of the mcu on the flip side of this i will say that i was very disappointed in chris evans captain america and i think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch i understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human hiddlesticks was phenomenal as loki and remains as easily the best mcu villain hes smart hes charming and most importantly hes british that must be a requirement on entry to the super villain squad because every villain in the universe is britishor at least the good ones are scarlett johanson was good as black widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and hawkeye she may not be a critical member of the team but shes a female and yay for diversity mark ruffallo was great as bruce banner and i adore how he refers to his alter ego as the other guy jeremy renner was fine as hawkeye and remains the most useful avenger with his sick archery skills seriously though he doesnt need to exist chris hemsworth was good as thor but not particularly memorable samuel jackson is great as nick fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy goldthe cinematography for this movie is great and i adore the tracking shots whedon uses in the action and i think it benefits the action so much whedon can do action supremely well the effects are amazing and are a delight to look at the costume design was great and the set design was also really good this movie needed to provide some fun action sequences be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard marvel fans i can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them as for the third one i cant comment but i will assume they were happy in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch if you havent seen this movie i highly recommend you do because it is pure adrenaline filled enjoyment910,fantasy
mehin this movie theres everything you expect just as you expect it extremely noisy action scenes a multimillionaire budget flaunted without restraint superhero brawls new york invaded by aliens for the 2735961th time and the usual stan lee cameoi suppose thats enough to satisfy marvel zombiesto me it seems like mr whedon worked alternating the autopilot with the copy  paste function for example the showdown against lokis army is basically transformers 3 final battle with different characters and a less talented directionthe only real surprises come from humor i have to admit that comic reliefs are effectively funny apart from this youll find nothing but cheesy costumes woody andor pointless dialogues tons of derivative spectacularity and a plot that often seems to go nowhere black widow with all that chatting aimlessly about her past is particularly confusingand thors hammer is blatantly fake,fantasy
i have never reviewed before but i cant accept this as good film when film like dark knight rises cant make that much success this film is 15billion gross when some good films in millions only waste commercial money stealer this film doesnt have anything to tell at all  there is no strong story line and edited piece some good movies   almost waste film with good fighting sequences and good graphics i just want to tell dont celebrate this kind of film if you do you are going to get lot of films like this dont attempt to see this at alli want to give it a zero but there is no zero in imdb,fantasy
this movie is retarded humanity must have seriously degraded if people consider this piece of crap the best of the best in cinema i cant believe this movie is just two points away from the same rating for scarface that movie was awesome not this piece of crap i think the movie order should go like this 1 the godfather 2 scarface 3 star wars episode vi return of the jedi 4 alien 5 titanic those movies are legendary but this movie this movie is no where near legendary i would rate this movie a zero but since i cant pick that i guess ill go with one star this movie has the most predictable plot ever to sum it up it goes like this bam boom bam boom cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue bam boom bam boom cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue bam boom bam boom the end the dialogue is some of the corniest crap in film history batman and robin was corny and stupid but at least it was tolerable with arnolds witty oneliners the scenes that were supposed to be funny made me gag and the scenes that were supposed to be serious made me burst out laughing at how stupid they were seriously the stupidity never ends from iron man fighting thor for absolutely no reason to nick fury shooting a plane carrying an atomic bombwith a bazooka the plane is carrying an atomic bomb and your idea to stop it is to shoot it seriously dont watch this movie its stupid and if your a huge fan it will be an even bigger disappointment if you want to watch a good marvel movie watch spiderman 2 that movie deserves an 83 rating not this kidfriendly nonsense,fantasy
spoilers ahead let me preface it by saying i have never been a fan of the marvel comics and only found a couple of the setup movies to be decent however i was still intrigued because of the very good reviews from critics and the box office success after watching this is not what i would consider a good film its basically on par or slightly above michael bays transformers series and anyone who has read my reviews of those knows how low i think of them even the best the original is really only average is pretty well made decently well acted and slickly produced but it just doesnt have a good story and the premise is basically absurd first the villain is nothing special lokis motives are vague his plan confusing at best and at no point is his character even that menacing right from the start you know that thor or iron man or hulk could kick the crap out of him so theres never any suspense as to whether loki would succeed second all the science and techno talk throughout makes little sense and is very difficult to follow i found myself not caring about iron man and bruce banners supposed genius after a while the script is just soooo formulaic you know the heroes will have personality clash at first you know there will be a sombering event that will pull them all together and you know they will prevail this has been done a million times in these movies and to be honest its been done way betterwhat is even the point of the scarlet johansen and jeremy renner characters theyre human and their abilities are really impossible to even believe same with their effectiveness when fighting the final battle in reality theyd have been killed in like 2 seconds like any other human fighting in a battle of immortals renners acting was also pretty bad same with chris evans captain america was just a wooden character and for a movie that was praised for a clever script and lot of humor i laughed only a handful of times even robert downey jrs alleged wit got annoyingand like i said no suspense in the final battle the alien army that had been built up throughout turns out to be very easily defeatable these guys get killed like nothing and dont even appear to have any special powers their forces turn out to be quite light as well besides hulk and thor are basically portrayed as immortal same as iron man when he is in the suit which has every magical ability under the sun so there is zero suspense because no one watching could ever believe for a second that any of these 3 could actually be defeated or killed the way iron man blows up their big ship is a ripoff of independence day anyway and of course he lives once again zero suspense as to whether he would make it its just poor filmmaking and really micahel bay could have made this movie especially the final battle thats basically what it isoverall youd have to be a huge fanboy of the comics to think this is a great movie its really not plus at 2 hours and 20 minutes it drags and drags and is a tough watch very disappointed overall not recommended 410,fantasy
from the name of this movie we are supposed to feel that this movie has to represent marvel superhero characters so this movie has a responsibility to make each superhero look as genuine as possible but it is not mostly successfulthe movie is entertaining in many moments i like iron mans suit removal scene seeing black widows confidence when she was being interrogated and her subsequent selfrelease the fighting between thor iron man and captain america when loki was taken to the helicarrierwhat do i dislike about the portray of the characters black widow in her normally very cold or cool appearance appears too surprised and fearful when she was in india while pointing the gun to bruce even though she already has backup if she is really a trained agent she should have prepared herself for the possibility of bruce getting angry but she reacted as though she was unprepared for that this conflicts her status as a trained agent if she was prepared she would have shown it more and concentrated more on evasive actions rather than felt so surprised and fearfulthe movie has quite bad immature jokesthe movies has many poorlyconstructed jokes that seem immature it mentioned adoption and bullying to crack jokes and the worst of all it uses the dying agent coulson to make people laugh it has quite a poor and unhealthy sense of humor it made me think whether this movie is only for young and immature teenagers to enjoy it could have an unhealthy influence on growing up kidsthis is the movies most confusing subplot the movies plot has loki and hawkeye trying to prevent the from stopping their plan hawkeye was to destroy one of the helicarriers engines why he didnt destroy the other engines is a mystery maybe he did not have enough ammunition loki comes aboard the helicarrier to create his own mental disruptionblack widow in her interrogation deduced that loki was trying to influence bane somehow so that he will turn into the hulk before he could locate the tesseract we can then see the scepter glowing with blue light when the were arguing and bane feeling agitated maybe loki was influencing bane to pick it up too but not many people could understand this part of the movie plot properly if they dont already realize that lokis scepter could influence minds this should have been hinted on when hawkeye suggested the plan to lokithe joke when the police chose to listen to captain america was also another lame comedic momenthawkeyes arrows should have more explosive power in the city and he should have been aiming the big targets rather than the small ones such as the head and eyes of the giant whales he seem weak in the movie he turned into a swinging spiderman at the end before looking like a poor casualty because he could not properly break his entrance which contradicts his character as a trained agent i think hawkeye fans would be more displeased with the portrayal of the characterblack widow should have a second round with loki at the stark tower with the mind games since they both like to play with each others minds but iron man took her place to show loki that his scepter could not work on him it seems like another lame comedy momenthulk was simply smashing everything nothing much captain america and iron man were their usual selvesthor was cool and not letting his character down but his hammer should have punched a hole in the containment glass rather than leave a crack loki was a great villain which was also obvious from the first thor movie he could win mtvs villain award this yearnick fury looks too agitated at times bruce should be more like thatthere are indeed many exciting and entertaining parts in the movie but nothing too much to brag about when it comes to the portrayal of some of the superheroes this movie makes some superheros look good but others look lousy the intention to make some of the superheros look fallible seems to end up making them look inaccurately portrayedmy judging for the movie because of the lame jokes i will minus 1 point i will minus another 1 point for black widow losing her cool in one scene i will minus another 1 point for the confusing subplot involving loki in the helicarrier i will minus another 1 point for making hawkeye not aim for the big targets and making him look like a bad victimized casualty after his ambitious spidermanlike crashing swing into a buildingtherefore i give this movie a rating of 6,fantasy
i really enjoyed captain america thor and the first iron man but the is just a mostly boring repetitive excessively long mess of selfindulgence youd never know that the talented joss whedon directed  the film has none of his trademark sly humor cleverness or pacinginstead we get a needlessly long film short on everything but action while mark ruffalo is excellent as bruce banner  the hulk the rest of the cast is pretty much cardboard frankly its just a dumb film and just because its popular does not mean its a good filmso if you like lots of action wooden dialog dumb plots and well a lot of noise youll love this mess of a film but if you expect to see a film thats better than the best episodes of josh whedons buffy or want more from a film be prepared to be disappointed,fantasy
this film wasnt good at all with the exception of the excitement of seeing all these leading characters in one movie i fail to see why everyone has been running and running to this movie first of all the acting is terrible led by chris evans as a fartooearnest captain america and chris hemsworth as a heavily accented thor with dialogue that made sense hundreds of years ago but not in 2012 robert downey jr mark ruffalo and scarlett johansson are decent enough but no academy award nominees there the plot and many of the subplots were difficult to follow as the primary purpose of this movie was to show cars buildings and people being blown up i understand that im not in this movies target demographic but the xmen series and iron man were far more intelligent and interesting than this yes i know this will be one of the highest grossing pictures of alltime which is why i wanted to know what all the fuss was yes i know there will be many sequels generated from this which makes sense just count me out from going to see them,fantasy
after i saw the trailer for the first time i didnt have high expectations for the movie i had the same feeling that i had when watching the transformer 3 trailer the first time after reading all the euphoric reviews on the internet i decided to watch the movie tonight i even saw it in 3d the movie was just as bad as the trailer looked the villain loki wasnt interesting or threatening at all whatever happened to a good villain  the whole story was really really weak the whole story reminded me very much of transformer 3 and was just as bad i dont understand why so many people here praise this movie if this is supposedly the best super hero movie hollywood is able to make in 2012 good night i dont understand why it is so hard for hollywood to make a great movie  with a really good dramatic epic story there are so many good comic book stories out there it cant be that hard to just turn them into a good movie i was just as disappointed from this movie as i was from transformers 3 i definitely wont watch this movie again at the movie theater  or buy it on dvd hoolywood has become so boring its sad i sick of all the cgi i just want to finally watch a good movie with a good story,fantasy
this is a good movie not great not awesome which is a shame because the first 30 minutes are fantastic edgy good jokes i love the way they bring the team togetherthis movie is black widows shes the best written character and has the best scenesmy issue with the movie is how safe it gets after such a great setup the movie goes flat and goes into safe blockbuster happy meal territory explosions and giant aliens and no one seems to get killedsame issues with hulk great setup mark does a great job of playing bruce banner outside of the first five seconds of the transformation scene we get lame looking cgi hulk that moves with the reality of a 50s warner bros cartoon i wanted to see thor and captain america and iron man really kick some major hind in this moviethey dont a good movie yet the worst of the marvel produced films once was enough,fantasy
this is not a great movie its not even a very good one i liked the first movie this one greatly disappointed methe plot and subplotbarely thereall the snappy dialog in the whole movie maybe equaled two minutescharacter relationshipswere supposed to believe them the audience wasnt born yesterdaythis movie focuses on the fight scenes technically they impressed me i counted 11 visualeffects companies in the credits i didnt time the fight scenes but i would guess that they take up at least 90 minutes of the movieso if you like fight scenes this movie is for you for the rest of us meh,fantasy
there are several reasons why this film fails as something a person should ever watch more than once firstly there is a major lack of plot twists or changes to the story that might keep you on the edge of your seat everything about the plot is insultingly linear and predictable and follows the most basic structure of goods versus evil with a predictable injection of basic virtue and morals  in this case unity and teamwork are clearly highlightedsecondly the film manages to insult your most basic intelligence by showcasing unnecessary antics that are nothing more than fantastical nonsense think of an action scene and describe it in words this is a way to bypass the lush graphics and realize that a while iron man is in space and is flying away from the portal he somehow changes direction in the vacuum of space and returns through the portal the hulk who cannot fly jumps a few hundred feet in the air and catches iron man before bouncing off to safety b nick fury is violently gunned down dusts himself down in time to evacuate the base c captain america is shot down dusts himself down and carries on d black widow who also is incapable of flight gives captain america psychic eyeballing to communicate she wants to jump ten times her height into the air by bouncing off your shield so i can hijack a spaceorcs flying motorcycle which is speeding towards us from a distanceone could argue that it is not meant to be realistic and is mere entertainment what becomes salient about assemble is that there are no rules the heroes never get stuck never get challenged theyre never in any recognizable danger there are no puzzles any challenge is overcome easily and characters do as they please no rules means no mystery no interest and nothing to keep you on the edge of your seatfinally the antagonist was hardly foreboding to ever present a sense of danger or worry against so many heroes all equal protagonists all dreadfully dull  especially bruce banner,fantasy
i saw this movie without any expectations the trailer did not entice me at all but took my 11 year old and 16 year old son of course i saw the high ratings from imdb and thought ok i got to go see itmy first impression was totally predictable second not at all impressed with the 3 d effects so i guess i have to sum it up to either at the age of 46 i am way to old old but then again i was not a big transformers faneveryone said this movie was really funny ok was it the dry homor or the hulk slapping thor in any case did not fall off my seat laughing the rest of the story line was kind of mondane but i guess this is what people today are looking for in a film,fantasy

ever seen one of those muscle pageants where they flex and flex and flex and flex and then they come back on and flex some more well thats kind of what the is like nearly every scene is a huge climax and its just a wet dream of adolescent violence and fantasy with no one being held accountable for any character actions i knew there wouldnt be much for story going into the big summer marvel franchise comic book blockbuster but i did expect an attempt at story look at spiderman or to a lesser extent transformers sure they sucked but at least they tried a blockbuster movie should be like a play to some extent showing subtext and depth rather than just defaulting on raw special effects exhibition why because these billion dollar franchises can afford to hire the best writers in the world but they dont they feel that their numbers data and formula will make them more money than the tried and true aristotlesocrates methods of portraying the human condition in a three act structure and theyre right money trumps all for the film industry is at the end of the day an industry that bases everything on huge profit margins one the largest margins in the history of mankind in facthowever if you look at some of the masterpiece visual effects movies of the last few decades which tried so hard to be there is a common thread that puts them above the rest they all engage in creative storytelling where characters are held accountable for their actions in some way no matter what the level of fantasy is that extra effort pays off in the subconscious and is the sole reason why a movie with effects alone cant give us the cerebral satisfaction of a star wars jurassic park lord of the rings avatar aliens or terminator 2 these type of films are like a broadway show giving you big climaxes and well timed beats you could say the matrix would be more like a cirque du soleil the is like the body building pageantas the themselves are constantly trying to out flex each other throughout the whole moviei have a rule regarding my 110 movie rating system any movie without a story can only score a maximum of 5 flawless effectsgreat actingno story respectfully this is not to say that all the writing was bad in the the dialogue was actually quite clever perfectly timed comic relief its strange that hollywood is notoriously bad at delivering honest unscathed human emotion and experience but so good at delivering comic relief one of the hardest things to do in all entertainment heres the story synopsis all the leads are invincible action action action one of them has turned bad and tries to take over the worldaction action action he fails but lives at the end to set up the sequel action action roll credits it literally plays like it was written by a 10 year old boy who plays with action figures in his back yard then spiced up by a team of ghost writers with well placed jokes and lots of downey jr nuances wouldnt surprise me if that what actually happenedis worth watching yes the acting is great except for scarlett johnasson who is brilliant in her own right but not a believable superhero its funny and very intense big action big sound testosterone gunfire some bowarrow action missiles gadgets rocket powered things aliens a nuclear bomb martial arts sequences gunfire even a touch of romance a mans movie through and throughbut im not so sure i think any good man movie should actually have in depth storytelling the matrix aliens aeon flux why not go the extra mile guys comic book movies should be held to the task especially because it was good storytelling that made their franchise pop in the first place film is a different medium you cant just expect everyone to know all the backstory and make things bad ass for the sake of seeing something bad ass you have to work at it a lot harder to tell an effective story in an arena where you are being timed to 2 hours of attention span fails just like most comic book movies sin city is a great example of effectively crossing over from comic book graphic novel into the film mediumit would be nice if hollywood spent just 1 of the 20000000000 spent on a movie like this toward paying a team of talented screen writers imagine if david mamet had written this or aaron sorkin with all the money and power and technology and talented artists bursting at the seams like the hulk to exhibit their skills it just seems like a no brainer to show us what money can really buyso its a no brainer movie just really good eye candy and a few laughs,fantasy
i have to admit i am no comic book reader but i have enjoyed a number of acceptable comic book movie adaptations 500 the first two xmen spiderman the first iron manthis is not one of them the story is boring and flimsy  loki wants to subvert earth why using a light cube called tesseract created by earth scientists what is this no explanation the who we mostly know from previous movies are assembled but there is no character development or any interaction and  apart from some smart lines from iron man  no meaningful dialogthe heroes first beat each other up then they make peace then they beat up bland loki and his alien invaders  thats the story not really fascinating is itthe movies effects are ok somewhat artificial in places but not overwhelming eg avatar was worlds above thisto summarize boring story bad dialog mediocre effects  this is a predictable popcorn movie unless you are a big marvel fan you can skip it,fantasy
ive seen the about 5 times in theaters now including the midnight premiere and i can say it is my favorite movie of all time and the by far the greatest superhero movie to ever exist it even surpasses the legendary films from the christopher nolan batman trilogy its a fantastic film allaround and it has characteristics that any moviegoer or nonmoviegoer would just love the plot has joss whedon written all over it and thats how everybody loves it with his other amazing pieces of work like firefly and buffy the vampire slayer this is the first marvel movie after its purchase by disney so that means amazing special effects and the doesnt disappoint with that at all being a hardcore marvel comics fan this movie is a dream it also has a spectacular starstudded cast chris evans returns as captain america chris hemsworth as thor robert downey jr as iron man scarlett johansson as black widow and samuel l jackson as sgt nick fury with new performances by cobie smulders as agent maria hill jeremy renner as hawkeye and by far the fanfavorite and greatest performance of the movie is mark ruffalo as the hulk people were nervous about the new hulk because they didnt know how ruffalo would perform as the hulk because edward norton played the hulk in the most recent incredible hulk movie but ruffalo delivered a performance that none of the other cast could top and was the hit of the movie the is a movie that no one can hate i guess thats why its the 3rd top grossing movie worldwide of alltime so unless you hate good movies and yourself go see the biggest movie of 2012 joss whedons masterpiece marvels the,fantasy
i remember this being largely anticipated i watched the iron man movies so i was going to see this it had lots of action but the plot was a little weak i also didnt understand why they took the villain from thor and couldnt use someone like thanos which is rumored to be the villain for the sequel yeah it had lots of jokes but most of them were too cheesy for me the best jokes come from iron man it gets a bit boring in the middle part overall i dont think this is a bad movie but i dont think it deserves a spot on the top 250 you should also know i almost never give movies a 1010 also the fan base for it is a bit annoying but i should leave that out the plot is basically a bunch of middleaged superheroes coming together to fight one of the superheros brother and his army of skrulls or chiatauris if you will ruffalos performance as the hulk was the best out of any of them unfortunately there is no hulk sequel planned for mcu phase 2 you should also now know that ive watched all the mcu films and own most of them on dvd overall 810 you should also know that i dont hate marvel and i love them over dc except when it comes to movies,fantasy
im still having my fingers crossed that the will overtake avatar as the most successful movie ever until another movie burst and takes over that is it would be such a great success and i would be so happy for joss wheddon a real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time as we speak has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll and all that is more than deserved while i dont think it is necessary to have watched the other marvel movies so far especially not the different hulks the will make you want to watch more look at your local video store for confirmationall the characters are here and have their moments maybe thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise but then again he is god so he wouldnt care anyway mark ruffalo is winning as a charlie sheen would say with his performance as hulkbruce banner robert downey jr as iron man is entertaining as ever and even if some claim that captain america is not needed i think he brings gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an iron man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole crew chris evans is perfect for that rolethe movie has been criticized for the weak villain i think that does injustice to the movie while the characters bar hulk have been introduced to you this still is a forming of a group it is more about the than it is about any villain and i dont think tom h loki is that weak even if hulk does disagreei watched the movie twice now and i enjoyed it both times time flies by and you dont realize how fast 150 minutes can go by i like the fact that joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid so maybe some will not get the jokebet between capt americas character and sam jacksons character though i reckon it wont be many but i loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of itsince this is a marvel movie you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end a friend of mine knew immediately what or rather who we saw there youll find the answer on the internet that scene came in between the credits there is another scene after the credits which as of yet was not shown in europe but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release dvd blu ray or whatever comes next im so looking forward to it  oh and the 3d is nice but its the storycharacters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ,fantasy
i like many others was waiting for this movie to come out after all those previews at the end of the credits in several movies like thor iron man etc i have to admit they did a very good promoting of this movie it made me want to see it more and morefirst of all dont get me wrong this is a very action packed and enjoyable movie you should see on the big screen i just think the story line was lacking and some characters was not up for this job and should have been left out like samuel jackson nick furyclint barton hawkeye and loki looked weak and his pointy scepter he had was a ridicules prop that appeared weak and fragile the rest of the cast was excellent especially iron man black widow,fantasy
i dont get why everyone likes it that much it is what my parents call big bad movie i agree with the big part but not so much on the bad part it starts out with a dark energy research station somehow bringing loki to earth he makes a big mess and we have all the superheroes coming in they capture loki he escapes go to new york and fight people from another dimension the end as simple as that good job special effects people the main battle was great but lasted such a long time without anything but plain violence i wanted to leave predictable ending lokis defeatedhooray the only value of the whole movie is the battle scenes jokes are corny and unoriginal youll be disappointed if you want to know about the superheroes most people like it because they read the comics i personally am a 2000nds kid so its not so great,fantasy
if you are a fan of action and comedy movies then the is the movie i would recommend the movie had my full undivided attention from beginning to end and considering it was a 2 and a half hour movie thats saying something it can be very difficult for a director to direct a long movie and keep the audiences attention but i must say this director did it and well at that it may seem like the typical hero vs villain movie but it has been the best one i ever saw by farmarvel has had many successful movies in the past like iron man and captian america except this time it included both marvel heroes and many moresoif you are unsure about whether to see the avenger or not i highly recommend it,fantasy
i love the in theory unfortunately in practice i couldnt wait for this movie to endfrom the empty backstory for the bad guys to a total lack of empathy for any of the main characters i found this whole experience soul crushingly dull which is odd when theres an explosion or a fist fight every 5 minutesit would be quite annoying to work out the veneerthin plot if not having seen some of the prior marvel outings for thor iron man et al but there are some saving gracesan almost seamless set of special effects does lend a sense of realism to the ridiculous scenarios that the heroes find themselves in and with plenty of running time to allow each a fair chunk of screen time it doesnt feel as if any one member is worth less than the restthats part of the problem for me with trying to squeeze an equal share for everyone in it starts to feel patched together losing coherence when the flow begins to break up my attention span begins to shorten i start to not care about the events or their impact on the story and instead just want to see the hulk smash,fantasy
i was lucky enough to score tickets to a prescreening of the in my city id loved all the other marvel movies leading up to it so i was really stoked the is the superhero movie weve been waiting for dont get me wrong i love the darkness of other superhero movies like the dark knight but as nick fury aptly puts it maybe we need a little oldfashioned and this movie is exactly that joss whedon gives us precisely what superheroes used to be  extraordinary people fighting their flaws to become the saviors of the human race in all fairness the is not a film that requires much thought its a beautiful spectacle but it definitely does not possess oscarworthy performances its slightly campy and tongueincheek which is oddly refreshing the never takes itself too seriously which i think a lot of people arent getting hence some extremely scathing reviews on herewith the exception of mark ruffalo every actor has gotten a chance to explore their characters in a previous movie which adds to the easybreezy feel of the movie that being said i thought mark ruffalo was a wonderful bruce banner  id love to see him in his own movie the action is nonstop and the cgi is phenomenal however this is another case of unnecessary 3d its didnt add anything to the effects except muddle them up on occasion when there was a lot going on this movie could be shown normally and it would almost be better believe the hype this is an awesome movie joss whedon did an fantastic job with the movie i cant wait for the 2,fantasy
the amount of hype and praise this movie has gotten is out of hand its simply a blockbuster actionmovie with superheroes the plot is easy to follow bad man wants to take over the earth for some reason gets help from aliens to do this superheroes stop himthem of course this is a bit general and yes i know the names etc of all these people beings having had separate movies for many of these heroes thor iron man captain america the incredible hulk we know these superheroes their character and motives if you will not all the audience will have seen the previous movies but its not exactly a difficult story to follow and we have seen the same plot 10000 times before in different variations and in different mediums books comicbooks films etcyou guys could see the movie or read about the whole synopsis right here because i cant bother telling it in detail anyway point is this if you want to see a summer blockbuster actionmovie with lots of eye candy then you have discovered the right movie its fun enjoyable and with lots of action naturally if youre looking for a great story though you might have to look somewhere else theres really no surprising twists or complexity no fear for the wellbeing of any of the characters and in short not a really interesting story to tell all the actionscenes are fun etc but if an alien species invaded us i would assume that they would have more potent weapons than some laser guns and huge fishlike robots that crash into buildings in manhatten really a demigod like loki and an advanced alien species are content with ravaging manhatten a bit seems like we humans have better weapons alone in the atomic bomb because one of those was enough to stop them yeah and we have superheroes three of which are severely underpowered and i dont understand why they were even there black widow hawkeye and captain america lame enjoyable and fun to watch but bad story should get around 67 imdb rating simply because its a wellmade actionmovie blockbuster no way this is among the best movies ever made as it stands now in the imdb ratings,fantasy
although if i may add a little personal bias here the is perhaps the hulk movie that never got made until now leaving the other two films starring eric bana and edward norton biting the dust when mark ruffalo was announced as taking over the mantle of the gamma powered being with anger management issues im sure many like myself would have been bewildered but ruffalo shows why hes the best hulk just yet and is a mean bruce banner as well we get back to seeing banner being a scientist enlisted not for his raging abilities but that of being the go to expert on gamma radiation that doesnt mean hes a pushover when it comes to the crunch and with ruffalo being motion captured rather than having the hulk purely cg is something different not to mention the countless of cool scenes the big monster gets himself into thanks to his powered abilities in short its almost hulk 3 hulk and friends insteadbut i digress the finally made it to the big screen after all those stingers in the various marvel movies gave audiences a tease for years the wait is over and boy was it worth the wait we welcome back the familiar faces in iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth as well as the shield agents in director nick fury samuel l jackson black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner coulson clark gregg and new addition maria hill cobie smulders as well as bit roles to others such as pepper potts gwyneth paltrow jarvis paul bettany professor selvig stellan skarsgard with loki tom hiddleston stringing all of them into a fit as the villain hell bent on enslaving all of humanity with help from an alien race army of course talk about an ensemble castand true to form joss whedon devotes adequate time to almost all of the and making this more like an extension of their individual films as we dwell a little bit more into the background and issues each hero face some which we know of from their earlier arcs that thankfully dont get rehashed too much save for certain quick montage sequences tony stark has just about finished his research on renewable energy not forgetting a new version of his armour that wed get to see here the mark vii captain america still finding his feet in the real world and showing shades of the leader hes growing into and thor continuing his bickering with half brother loki that culminates into having him being sent back to earth to take his villainous brother back to asgaard once again the quieter moments in the film provides plenty of opportunity for characterization and whedon doesnt disappoint in showing how well hes comfortable and knowledgeable about each one of them from comic folk loreand when it comes to what fan boys all over the world are clamouring for whedon doesnt disappoint when it comes to larger than life action that pits the either against each other playing into the hand of loki in his divide and conquer strategy and when they finally get their act together to cooperate and save the world the team ups here either in twos or threes is fun in every essence of the word pitting each hero against each other or when cooperating to address problems that require their unique combined abilities and theres always good natured humour around the corner when you least expect some really taking you by surprise yet is still keeping true to the nature of each character if youd think the bulk of the wisecracks come from stark well think againwhedon also makes it a conscientious point never to rehash what had already been seen in the individual movies but providing a lot more and expanding the scope from what had been done before i assure you that youd havent seen the hulk do battle like what he does here easily becoming a fan favourite and stealing the thunder from the rest and of course a lot more from captain america whose own film saw a limited variation in his fighting abilities as compared to what he finally does here thor with mjolnir is another dimension and class altogether while hawkeye finally saw some battles of his own after his short cameo appearance in thor where he didnt fire a single projectile the biggest challenge and change of course was on tony stark and it would be interesting to see if this change about being less egoistical and selfcentered would translate into his next film as well the final battle that took at least half an hour of screen time is the comic book come alive in larger than life spectacle thats best seen in the imax 3d formatso whats next iron man 3 will blast off and be first off the blocks then there should be another captain america film that will showcase more of shield i guess maybe either thor or hulk may make a big screen return next before getting everyone together again for another hurrah hinted upon midway through the end credits but which was mentioned would be a smaller film than this one lets wait and see but in the meantime get out there and enjoy this one heck of a ride definitely a film that fans of either hero will find irresistibly awesome and in a league of its own more please,fantasy
firstly i have seen this movie twice already and this is the best marvel movie anybody else that says otherwise is either out of his mind lying or hasnt seen the movie yetyou may think that in a movie that consists of four characters who have their own franchise would do injustice to the two new characters in the movie think again black widow and hawkeye also have their time on the screen but of course the best lines go to iron man and the most epic fight scenes go to the hulkafter watching the two hulk movies i was a little disappointed only to the extent that they show him as this destructive and out of control monster which he is but this movie makes you sympathize with him and even make you like him in fact i felt that the fight scenes involving the hulk were the best in the whole movie followed by iron man i won hide the fact that i am a huge batman fan i find nolans movies head and shoulders over other movies but this movie is up in the same league highly polished character screen presence well directed amazingly witty very very funny and above all visually captivating i felt the run time was a little short actually i just didnt want it to end considering people were clapping and yelling out their approval for some of the movies topnotch scenes this movie will be a huge blockbuster which it thoroughly deserves to be i am predicting it will be the next 1 billion grosser this movie just raised the bar to a whole new level for marvel movies seriously i was more eager for the release of the dark knight rises but wow what a show by marvel and i would say full credit to joss whedon you sir are just outstanding the movie was tight and it didnt have any loose ends worth mentioning first my favorite series of all time firefly now this thank you joss whedon that was a mindblowing movie i will watch it a few more times ,fantasy
the first question does the is a film of six superheroes answer is no the movie is heavily based on the power and skills of iron man and later followed by hulk all other characters are just supporting characters adding no extra flavor to remember since captain america hawkeye  natasha dont have super powers they lacked the status of being a superhero as far as is concerned even the possibility of emotional connects between clint barton hawkeye and natasha was missing also steve rogerscaptain america was struggling to make a presence with other super powersif one has to term the as ironman 3 than it would not be possibly wrong because from the beginning to the climax its he who holds the film either by his action or style or the dialogues some of them are really cool the auto removal of his ironsuit by robotic machines was kool and in a scene where loki pushed him from the heights the way his iron suit came auto activated and became his bodysuit was awesome thou hulk was entertaining but he came into his smashing avatar only after half the way movie has past the way he beaten up the loki after his comments of being a god was really enjoyable but joss whedon the director could have done better to balance out the movie in terms of introducing equally capable superheroes also first half of the movie gradually reaches to boredom with the introduction of superheroes its only in the second half that excitement moved to the next level when we talk about visual effects cinematography production value 3d version or soundtrack all are good and worth praising regarding performances its again all the good humor punches goes along with ironman which makes you smile followed by hulk tom hiddlestone as loki and scarlett johansson as natasha were impressive rest all were limited in role to mentionoverall its a good weekend watch especially for ironman and hulk fans but may not live up to the hype created walt disney is gradually learning to tap southasian markets by pre releasing the movies here after the debacle of john carterthou a good movie hope this will worked outthanks  regards ava thecritiquelabcom,fantasy
rating 45  supers epic adventurethe or assemble is an eagerly anticipated superhero film in 2012 which is written and directed by a cult film maker joss whedon based on marveldc superhero comics the by stan lee and jack kirby starring robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston and samuel l jackson the 2012 is the best and most entertaining marvel superhero films ever made for superfans and others this movie truly fulfills audience expectations till the endi am not going to talk about the story here because who cares about the script its just supers at all however its a typical superhero plot where the group of american superheroes are assembled together for a highly complicated mission and saving the earth from the bad guys who take over the world what else it could be its understood that always hollywood saves the world from bad guys in this film hollywood collaborates with marvel comics and bringing together six of marvels superheroes including iron man hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow to face the supervillain demi god loki tom hiddleston it is the best sequel ever made for iron man and hulk especially the incredible hulk is the most incredible vital character in this film the second half of the film is moving fast due to the unlimited action sequences including motion captured cgi monster hulks smashups omg i cant believe that this film made the incredible smile and he also makes you produce laughterthe special effects and motion captured cgi are highly impressive and nevertheless the stunning action choreography is highly potential till the climatic battle overall everybody had done a good performance in particular the interesting member in the crew iron man robert downey jr performance is good and holding the attention unique with wit the director and cowriter joss whedon has done a great job even though the script is not complicated much but he had constructed the characters well in the script and also he had changed their characteristics a bit like the hulk he had given everyone an equal opportunity in the film and made everyone radically distinctive in their skills there is a bit of humor in this film slapstick gags which is handled well and everybody enjoyed throughout the film however director joss whedon is quite innovative with unique comedy and special effects which is always helping the narrative move forward the protracted conversation for superheroes could have been avoided in the film people wont expect the superhero to talk so in my opinion dont make them talk much in the scriptresult the is a superhero film with dramatic action thrilling adventure fun alien invasion superheroes with super powers including ridiculous costumes and accessories unbeatable smashup collisions hightension action sequences with the spectacular special effects which are all combined together and leading us to the happy ending its truly worth watching and highly recommended for marvel fans and superfansthe avengeance in 3dsunday april 29 2012,fantasy
the ultimate superhero mash up from marvel studiosfollowing the huge success of iron man robert downey junior and the relative healthy returns for the lesser known thor chris hemsworth hulk now mark ruffalo and captain america chris evans the obvious monetary synergy of all four characters in the same movie is obviousadding to the mix we have tight leather clad black widow johansson and hawkeye jeremey renner along for the ride following their brief appearances in the previous films on bad guy duties we have loki tom hiddleston hell bent on creating a portal to earth to allow his army of minions to flow through and capture the world making him the undisputed leader of well everythingon paper this should not really work we have numerous superheroes all with very different powers origin stories character arcs and so forth somehow writer and director joss whedon of buffy and serenity fame manages to create a cohesive whole each character gets to contribute and have their moment or two in the sun noone appears sidelined for too long the ultimate tag team if you will even agent phil gets his chance to shinewhedon is far to sharp to allow proceedings to get too pretentious for every hint of comic book mythology a pin is on hand to puncture the balloon audiences and characters clearly instructed not to take all this too seriouslycomplaints the film does feel long and there are shades of transformers 3 in the climactic scenes have we not done organic alien monsters destroying skyscrapers the story is largely irrelevant all the crew are called together by nick fury samuel ljackson in full hell yeah mode to defend the earth against this ultimate threat loki wields his staff with aplomb initially stealing away hawkeye and selvig skellan skarsgard we know they are working for the wrong side due to their crazy eyes until of course they experience some cognitive repair surgery or get bashed on the head dependent on your medical trainingthe effects are top notch production values off the scale and it is obvious the director has a firm grip on the material and belief in his characters all participants appear to be having a whole lot of fun and it comes across on the screenwho would have thought a few years ago that cast lists of this quality would be lining up to play comic book heroes how times and story lines have changedso to the characters stark is just stark every mans wish fulfillment rich beyond dreams able to ignore anyone and everyone good with the ladies but now settled with the radiant pepper potts gwyneth paltrow thor continues to talk in nordic god like speak which never gets old the trusty hammer mjolnir gets a good work out here incidentally natalie portmans character is referenced but not shown on screencaptain america is tried and true embodying a dependable old world can do attitude which is a pleasant antidote to iron mans showy pursuits evans does well here actually anchoring the character somewhere firm amongst all the chaosstrangely the character that should not work at all just maybe steals the show the hulk whose character development in real life now has morphed through three a list actors is the obvious crowd pleaser he also gets the best two laughs in the film and the least expensive wardrobe just a torn shirt and some cut off jeansthe hulk is played rather well by ruffalo bringing something to the role that norton or bana did not find the big guy remains under wraps for quite some time but when he gets angry he sure makes some messclearly the studio are thinking big stay for the set up as it is clear the work is not done yetsummary yet another high for the comic book genre post modern and self knowing in the approach this works better than anyone might have dared to expectbig loud expensive comic book superhero mashup not to be taken seriously just enjoyed for the spectacle on show and the obvious thought care and intelligence invested in the seriesrecommended httpjulesmoviereviewsblogspotconz,fantasy
to start off this is single handle the best film of the year hands down well until the dark knight but this movie is some serious competition i had never heard of the director joss until this film was made and to be honest looking through his film history i was having some doubts which i now take back he has done a amazing job he gives each character all the amount of time they deserve he created intense and epic battles and very humorous moments to top it offto cut a long story short this movie is amazing not perfect but amazing and it is a must see no matter what whether you are a comic book fan or not,fantasy
 turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser i was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when i saw the movie tonight in one word  superb i dont mind watching it once again shield director nick fury is threatened by loki and his armed forces loki is sinister brother of thor who was dethroned from kingdom of asgard for his misdeeds he plans an attack on earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the earth from asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into lokis slave in order to protect earth from destruction nick fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by ironman  captain america  thor and hulk along with black widow and hawkeye together  they must fight the evil loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave it would have been really challenging for joss whedon director of serenity to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comicstory into a mustsee film the movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities of course if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue the differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of hulk  the fight between thor and ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues cinematography is enthralling the cgi is magnificent with thrilling visual effects on the flip side  any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here nevertheless it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast robert downey jr clearly stands out in his portrayal of ironman and witty one liners he is just getting better with each film surprisingly i liked mark ruffalo as bruce bannerthe hulk his puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as bruce banner and his change of expression as the hulk overall  an actionpacked entertainment with good storyline  lovely performances and superb cgi it is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well excellent 45,fantasy
i saw this was 88 on imdb and thought wow i really should see whilst its at the cinema i really liked spiderman 1 and the recent superman so i thought id really enjoy this movie as well wrong this movie lacks any character development or suspense it moves from event to event without any build up so there is no anticipation within the viewer nothing really bothers any of the which makes the movie boring i mean thor has an incredibly hard fall and when he gets back up his hammer hand doesnt work for a whole 5 seconds next time the movie cuts back to his scene hes right as rain so theres no opportunity for the audience to really care about what happens on screen as everyone takes it in their stridethe special effects are very good i went and saw it in 3d but i think it would be better enjoyed in 2d there is a certain lack of clarity in most movies that have 3d applied post production its not bad its just not good enough eg like avatar was to make up for the reduction in clarity and extra 3tldr no character development or anticipation gave it 5 for the special effectsftr i am a 32yo female,fantasy
that was one of the worst bs comic book movies ever its as bad as the first hulk movie and the green lantern movie with ryan reynolds some of the scenes in the from the beginning to end were complete non sense very unnecessary felt forced lack creativity and almost amateurish i dont understand the high ratings and the high gross for the movie which is attributed to the 5000 3d fees per person are some of you people on some kind of drugs maybe inhaling too much theater popcorn chemicals or something brainwashed by joss whedon i loved his movies and tv shows but 1hr and 40mins before we see any real actions and you guys think its a good movie come on its the same crap as the first hulk movie by the way ruffalo sucks as banner ed norton was great on the second hulk movie stop sniffing the popcorn chemicals please,fantasy
i had very high expectations for this movie after seeing that it got  8510 on rotten tomatoes needless to say this movie was a disaster 65 of the movie was full of them talking about how they are going to kick some ass while the other 35 was them actually doing the deed this movies ending was very predictable and was like every other superhero movie ever created i can not imagine why someone would give this terrible film a rating greater than 110i had very high expectations for this movie after seeing that it got  8510 on rotten tomatoes needless to say this movie was a disaster 65 of the movie was full of them talking about how they are going to kick some ass while the other 35 was them actually doing the deed this movies ending was very predictable and was like every other superhero movie ever created i can not imagine why someone would give this terrible film a rating greater than 110bad pitiful terrible horrible,fantasy
whywaseveryonespeakingsoslowly do they  all have a speech impediment this is a ghastly movie the worst i have ever partially watched i read the reviews for prometheus which was not flawless but it was powerful and contained some outstanding imagery and it actually scored lower than this  the odious piece of crap the acting was extraordinarily bad the dialogue so witless and dim that it defies belief i watched the first hour but was in danger of vomiting with disgust at any moment and so turned it off scarlet johansen is a classy actress what was she thinking also gwyneth paltrow robert downey junior is a great actor who seems to always play in dumb movies hes worth more than than i heard good things abut this movie what have we come to that people rate this garbage as entertainment,fantasy
your typical modern action movie all style no substance plot is close to nonexistent or at least incomprehensible very jumbled entirely because the writers wanted to somehow meld all the individual avenger stories into one story makes for a contrived messas expected the special effects and action sequences are good hard to compliment performances in an action movie as there is very little real acting involved however robert downey jr puts in a show stealing performanceon the whole vastly overrated and this is probably a sign of how dumbeddown the general population is with regard to expectations for movies the only positive thing i can say is its better than transformers but that says very little,fantasy
this movie was very average nice effects and soundi expected more thor was good looking captain america is nice but what are his powers exactlyironman was nice better than ironman 3 which came out after this moviethe actor who played the hulk is a miss castspiderman is missing in this movie in my opinionblack widow is good lookingloki is a boring villaindc probably see this movie and can make it better with justice leauge,fantasy
movies first two thirds were pretty cool the last third was just trashlike when the giant spaceship monster equipped with shark like teeth enters the city and starts to destroy ny with all its minions why do all evil things in movies have to have teeth and fangs why does the ship here have to have that also and make dinosaur noises i mean does it eat other ships and chew on them reminds me of the movie green lantern when the all powerful yellow energy monster travels through space yet has to have a mouth with sharp teeth and fangs  and make loud scary noisesthis movie is decent but gets way over hyped for some reason i think its because all the fanboys just love seeing all the heros together at the same time 5 out of 10,fantasy
superhero movies have been the craze for a while now sure theyve always been around but now they seem to be coming out in droves either a new hero to make a movie for yet another sequel to an existing series batman 13 spiderman 13 amazing spiderman 12 iron man 13 captain america 12 thor 12 and the extensive xmen series to name a few or another reboot yes they are popular but for the most part extremely formulaic other than nolans batman series there is not much new in any of those movies and the is no different maybe even worseeverything you expect to see in the you will see some snappy oneliners from downey jr explosions an excessive use of cgi good guys win bad guys lose dot dot dot i think ive seen this one before there is no creativity no thought nothing really if you enjoy movies that require no thought this one is for youand the hype i put this up there with the fast  the furious its that bad yet so many people seem to love it are we really that unimaginative and dull its only exciting if you cant see past the cgi and battle scenesif you would like to watch a superhero movie with actual substance watchmen is a terrific example they are the anti if you will enough with these cookiecutter characters please dont waste your time on this one,fantasy
judging from this movie reception we could easily conclude that this is one of the best comicbook movies ever but truth be told it is a pretty generic movie it has all the favorite clichs the evil that will destroy the world we have typical jerkhero transformation with pseudo sacrifice and all the others unpredictable character evolutions i would call it a wellcrafted movie actionscenes are good dialog can be fun sometimes and the acting is nice it just brings nothing new to the table and it is one of those movies that you will watch and then remember a couple of sceneslines from it and later on youll just remember a warm fuzzy feeling that it left in you so it is worth to check it outfinal verdict  it is not groundbreaking but it is an entertaining movie so check it out,fantasy
this is one of those movies that has both good points and bad points for starters i thought iron man robert downey jr and the hulk mark ruffalo were absolutely sensational likewise most of the other characters were well played too on the flipside though the introduction of hawkeye jeremy renner was terribly planned and presented not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind not only that but his costumeor basic lack thereofalso stuck out like a sore thumb additionally although i liked the cgi i thought it and the nonstop action were just too overwhelming even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them this made the film look extremely uneven too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup be that as it may this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be a jumbled mess all things considered then i think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in a very mediocre film accordingly i rate it as only average,fantasy
if you are planning on watching this movie or a similar one then its best you dont check imdb out a lot of reviews in here have been written by bots that gave the movie 10 without addressing any of its major issuesthats not to say i dont understand why anyone would like this movie it has some qualities such as action animation and a few laughable lines but to a viewer that want to be entertained by more than just cheesiness this movie failsfirst of all it commits a mistake that is pretty obvious to begin with way too many major characters are tried to fit into one movie we are left with some story lines for hulk iron man and thor the most major members of the while black widow and that bowman are just forgottenthe villain is also pretty forgettable its loki thats back and hes a spoiled kid that never really seem that powerful or impressive compared to the i am not going to spoil anything but it seems like he attempts to be a really clever villain but just ends up as a spoiled kidthe plot in general is also pretty forgettable its standard mediocre superheroes stuff that youve seen a hundred times in superhero moviesif youre a diehard superhero or marvel fan or just enjoy action and cheesy lines then this is your movie if you want a movie with an interesting plot and characters then look elsewhere,fantasy
i dont know why this movie was so popular it had zero story and simply felt like it was a comedy that is one of my many problems with this movie1 the movie might as well have been called iron man  friends the entire thing just felt like robert downey jr trying to get attention2 the action sequences were completely unoriginal the battle of new york just felt like a copy of transformers 33 the aliens didnt actually do anything all they did was blow up cars and fly aroundthis movie is passable but completely overrated,fantasy
short review here action action action action action and not much else weak writing weak characters feels like the script was thrown together with not much thought as if they put all the actions scenes on the board first then half assed pretty much the entire story and dialogue it really is a film made for young kids not one extra is shown being killed i wouldnt be surprised if in the next one there shooting for a pg rating only ticket sales would most definitely be higher and you know the more people you can get in that cinema seat the more  the studios will make who cares if the movie is a pile of s and theirs always part 2 to look forward too to bad theyre throwing that one together even faster then this one yikes thats pretty scary,fantasy
im generally a joss whedon fan but this film is truly awfulnow before im pilloried by the marvel fanboys let me explain why1 the first hour of the film is spent gradually very gradually at points reintroducing characters from the previous marvel character films which this is to be expected it happens not in any organic way but in a very perfunctory forced manner by introducing the crisis immediately as the film beginsthis is disconcerting for a number of reasons not the least of which is because it leaves you very little room to go up from there theres no build up to the introduction of the enemyits just there2 for all of this often needless exposition there is little if any character development within the first half of the film which left me feeling cold towards any of the main characters  i just dont care if they die kill em all 3 because the action starts at the beginning and doesnt really stop every moment of exposition feels like it takes a year just to get going what is often intended to be humorous springy dialogue is delivered in scenes that are utilitarian at best and just leaden mill stones at worstthe script is wellwritten and the actors do very serviceable jobs delivering their wellwritten lines but the truth is that because the movie started with action and kept going no one really cares what they have to saywill it entertain some people yes butfrankly its just not worth paying a monthly subscription to watch on netflix much less purchase it to own,fantasy
before i say everything that was wrong with the movie i will first say that i am familiar with the comics and source material and have thought all the marvel cinematic universe movies so far were decent my personal favorite is ironman 1 one of my favorite movies overall because of the way it told the story and how it maintained more realism than the other movies in the franchise series of marvel movies physics engineering and basic foundations of life were followed while telling the story of tony stark everything while elaborate seemed possible possible is the key wordi grew up watching bill bixby be the incredible hulk with lou and thought the show was awesome i do know though that technology wasnt around the make hulk be what the comic wanted him to be the hulk movie therefore was decent but nothing i am dying to watch again captain america and thor were decent tooso what was i expecting when i saw i was expecting the 1992 dream team i was expecting a movie that would be epic in every way where each character was maximized to their fullest while trying to solve a deep plot similar to the watchmen or even the recent dark knight trilogy i got neither the plot in my opinion was way too simplified and even worse all the characters seemed to be more forgettablei will say some of the casting was quite poor and didnt flow with the original intent of the characters and some were just annoying in their roles scarlett johansson and jeremy renner in particular were very unwatchable even though like lost in translation and the hurt lockeroverall i can see how this movie made so much money it is the perfect movie to take younger kids and comic book fans it is actually even better for those that dont know the source material because they are coming into the movie fresh however this is no dark knight type of movie with the depth of plot realworld story lines or the perfect casting i give it 710 and hope 2 is a lot better executed,fantasy
well it is all shiny and stuff to have all the super heroes together but without any real plot its just a lot of soulless fireworks with an attempt to manufacture a positive response from the audience with the indestructible nature of the hulk and thor what need is there of the restas for the wit element bought to us mainly by iron man it is overdone there has to be a balance to take the viewers on a true ride of emotion suspense and overall awe elements that this movie just does not havei still do not understand how this can get a rating above 7 which brings about an element of doubt as to the rating system and credibility of all rated movies on this site,fantasy
if you like your typical action packed superhero movie the is the perfect movie it has action suspense and humor with a touch of romance thrown in it has amazing heroes a great villain fighting scenes a rivalry between hero and villain and an allstar cast what it lacks is originality all superhero movies are the same the world has been threatened in some way and a superhero must rise to the occasion to overcome the threat the ongoing battle between good and evil which isnt any different in this movie what makes the different from other superhero movies is the compilation of characters the world has been threatened once again and we need iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo the black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to come together and save us as thors brother loki tom hiddleston plans to use a glowing cube called the tesseract to open a portal bringing an evil alien army to earth to help takeover we have beat loki before in the movie thor now he is back with a vengeance unfortunately if you have not seen these movies you will need to catch up as there is not a lot of back story on why these heroes were chosen with everything going on you do not really get to understand the characters especially why loki wants to control the world even if you havent seen them you know what to expect and can understand the basic storyline there are no surprises you can plot out the movie before you even watch it overall i found the movie to be exiting but explored way too many times the whole idea of needing a superhero to come save us has been done before originality is what makes a movie great director joss whedon did a great job compiling different characters together into one movie even with amazing special effects and compelling characters i believe he could have made a better storyline with more surprises we should be walking away thinking wow i did not expect that to happen the world will continue to want heroes in their lives in movies like the we are given hope that good will always overcome evil which is why im sure they will be coming out with another one soon i just hope to be speechless and amazed when its over,fantasy
ok went into the cinema in april ready to give this film a fair chance of course i knew what to expect and as usual i wasnt disappointed not that thats good for the film after watching it i then began to hear almost everybody say it was the best film in the world well that a huge claim well tbh it doesnt have any of the qualities of best film ever made in it story was at best flawed some characters i would go as far to say as boring and the special fx were just a cover up blinding viewers from the truth its not a great film and then theres the villain weakbut its not all bad i thought it was funny and if your a fan of everything exploding then it is good for a quick thrill thought nick fury iron man and bruce banner were good charactersi think the kindest thing i can say about this movie is that it is average but like avatar it is hugely overrated im afraid its another example of fx covering a mediocre story fun to watch but not the best film ever made by some way,fantasy
only thing i didnt want to end up with was that what if the turned out to be sc im happy i didnt having solved the purpose of what most of the indians expect out of a hollywood action flick the did a pretty decent jobwith all the superheroes coming out of the marvels comic world to the silver screen the film is a good deal for those who fantasize of ultra advanced reality possible scientific machines and gadget of men and women with extraordinary or superhuman skills in short for people who loved the star wars and played contra also the movies like a platter as you get to taste a lot too much in a single order featuring six superheroes especially iron man and the hulk its a nice combination if you like to explore the marvel universes fantasy though i missed the spiderman and wolverinetalking of what all i missed i certainly missed a bit of reason in the story the story bores you in between and with an exhibition of the superheroes i definitely wanted a bigger villain with some solid spine wasnt there i thought that the hulk and the iron man had had better nemesis in their individual movies felt bad for the subdued superheroes poor captain america a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist  iron man aka tony starks reply to captain america my secret is that im always angry  the hulk with superb dialogs the film amazes you with the gross action sequences alongside the proper pinch of humor courtesy hulk and iron man undoubtedly they both steal the show and mark a livelier presence on screen tony starks iron mans wit makes you applaud the angry hulk makes you laugh and you find his anger cute in two particular scenes first one when he with thor kicks some butts after which when naturally standing hulk punches thor out of the frame well the hulk had to vent his anger somewhere after all second was his reply to the demi god villains claim of being what he was it certainly reminded me the days when i played wwf as a kidwith the commendable action in 3d all perfect performances by robert downey jriron man  mark ruffalothe hulk with very impressive act from jeremy rennerhawkeye the film is worth a watch as you get to spend some quality time with the ever so beautiful scarlett johansson as the red head black widow while shes busy turning and twisting arms and breaking bonesits exactly what we expect from a hollywood action film though could have done better with the plot with superb casting of all characters including samuel jackson as nick furry it would secure a definite 35 out of 5 stars for me my take go watch it,fantasy
 assemble is incredible to say the least and i wasnt in anyway disappointed with it before i saw it i decided to watch iron man iron man 2 the incredible hulk captain america and thor so id be all prepared for it i mean its everything youd want from a great movie excellent action excellent directing an excellent cast of actors excellent dialogue excellent special effects and an excellent script i bet it was hard deciding on who would direct this movie with such high expectations but joss whedon who created such tv series like buffy the vampire slayer and firefly was the best choice and he directed it perfectly i mean he didnt overdid like michael bay does with action movies he actually had it well thoughtout and the action really works in the movie its amazing how you can take a bunch of superheroes from separate movies and come together to make one fantastic movie now all the actors did great but i think tony starkiron man is the life of the party because hes the funniest and coolest and robert downey jr is one of my favourite actors ever also scarlett johansson one of my favourite actresses is tough as she is sexy as black widow and i like the different relationships between the characters in fact in my opinion its ten times better than the dark knight because the dark knight was too dark and overdone but i cant really decide whether the is better than the dark knight rises because both movies blew my mind awaybut after seeing this movie ive decided that i ought to get reading superhero comics because theyre the original source and i love superheroes but for the next movie im really hoping that they put spiderman and wolverine in even though most people say its highly unlikely but until then ill continue watching assemble,fantasy
even with the action packed fighting scenes of numerous superheroes and very clever humor the fails to live up to its expectations as being the best superhero movie ever madebasically the only people who were acting in the movie were captain america nick fury  black widow the rest were there just to fight even if that was the soul purpose of the movie not a lot of work was put into the performance of the main characters except for the ones mentioned abovestill dont know why captain america and hawkeye were casted in the movie they have no soul importance yes captain america is inspiring but marvel couldve surely gone with anyone else maybe wait another year and let the reboot of spiderman release and cast spiderman in the the only thing that exceeds expectation is the hulk with its awesome power and dominance even that was kept very latethere werent any jawdropping action scenes but there were some great laughs when the heroes fought or argued with each otherall in all it can be called a disappointment because i really dont think this movie is better than spiderman or spiderman 2 or batman begins or the dark knight or iron man or the incredible hulk or even thor in my opinion this not the best marvel movie ever made the reason to which i think could be that it was done very hurriedly bad  nodisappointed  yes710,fantasy
the i could tell you is the greatest film of our time or possibly the greatest i came into this film with minor expectations after seeing the trailer but being a comic book fan i decided i should give it a go and mate this was one spectacular film done very well by joss whedon the man famous for putting together buffy the vampire slayer certainly knows how to write a script with almost every line memorable and giving all the heroes a chance to do something cool with nothing left out that could ruin the plot 2012s the has done a job well donethe iron mantony starkrobert downey jr was at his very best performing with ease and i actually thought he was cool in thischris hemsworth plays the norse god thor who was just awesome in this film and showedhawkeye played by jeremy renner did a job well done especially with the arrow shots finally we found the perfect person to play the hulkbruce banner as mark ruffalo looks like a nerd and doesnt look angry in every scene like the other hulks and made the hulk look like a cool guy rather than the others who took it like it was a curse scarlett johansen improves from her kick ass performance in iron man 2 to become a real person you would not want to make angry and proves to us she is in for more than just the good looks tom hiddelston pulled of our villain very well and if you though he was cool in thor he was even more cooler in this and probably the best villain since the dark knight we couldnt forget samuel l jackson who no longer appears just at the end for a few minutes but finally brings together thealan silvestri even pulled of a great job with the soundtrack and could i dare say it was better than what he had for back to the future well it was wayy better than the back to the future soundtrack and i never thought i would say that the is just the greatest film everr 11 out of 10,fantasy
superheroes are not prime film material i would probably never include a superhero film among my favorite 100 films maybe watchmen but thats not really a superhero film but instead a deconstruction of the genre anyway some are highly entertaining such as spider man 2 and batman the dark knight but nothing that really send chills down my spine induces into goosebumps or makes my eyes wetit has some very cool awesome moments but it is not like the matrix awesome its mediocreokay awesome it is a highly overrated film here in the imdb it is surely not top 250 material in any way shape of form i was disappointed when i saw the film because it had a 87 score on imdb at the time obviously the product of nerdgasmic reaction to an accurate depiction of the characters in the comics anyway i dont read superhero comics so,fantasy
do not know how someone could not love this movie first of all joss whedon is a genius and everything he touches is gold beyond that he has infused his witty sense of humor into the marvel world so that this movie is by far the best superhero movie made to date highlights the best of each character giving each their time to shine without getting too involved with any one character they are perfectly blended which creates a fun entertaining atmosphere for the audiencei could go on for forever on how great this movie is gets even better the more you watch and pick up on things just have to give it a shot you wont be disappointed btw cannot wait for the whedon created tv series shield and of course 2 love you joss,fantasy
first let me state that superhero movies of any kind are really not my genre of choice ive watch enough in the past to know that when it comes to films andor tv shows superheros are not where my attention is most likely to be held be that as it may i decided to give the a try after numerous discussions with my work colleagues and an internal battle with myself that anything even remotely touched by joss whedon could never be anything less than exceptional sadly the film failed to spark the fire within my inner superheroin and i was left unimpressed dont get me wrong im well aware that im one of only a limited few who were less than thrilled by the film and by all accounts to a superhero fan im sure it was amazing but for mei think the main problem i had and i feel it could be the same for others who didnt really enjoy was a lack of understanding for anyone who isnt a die hard comic book fan or hasnt seen the previous movies particularly thori felt that there was so much going on that i couldnt understand fully what i was watching thankfully the colleagues i mentioned earlier had the foresight to give me a little knowledge so i wasnt entirely clueless i knew who were the good and bad guys but when it came to the plot i had no idea my advice to anyone whos going to give this movie a shot is to maybe do just a little research if you can maybe watch the different films iron man 12 thor captain america first so you can identify the characters who you spend two hours watching it helps in this case to be prepared the one thing i did enjoy was the action deep at heart i like a good movie explosion as much as the next girl and on that front there was enough to just pique my interest but as a majority of the good stuff happens in the last hour or so of the film for me it came a little too late to save things i went in with the mindset that six superheros had to be better than one i left with the mindset that herny cavill as superman is my last ditch attempt to find some interest in the superhero genre,fantasy
based on the hype i expected the to be one of those classic comic book movies that leave you breathless and amazed helmed by joss whedon lead up to by several other comic book movies i really thought this would be amazingbut its not amazing its good its about iron man good which puts it a notch above thor a notch below captain america and several notches above iron man ii and the incredible hulktheres just not a lot to it captain america was a good movie because it delved into the character but here the movie rarely goes deeper than the occasional witticism the only character theme is some squabbling but this comes across as kids on a playground although it is entertaining to see the movie play the what superhero could beat what superhero game and resolves itself perfunctorily this is not what i expect from joss whedon its what i would have expected from whedon directly after he made the original buffy the vampire slayer moviethis is not to say that the movie is not enjoyable it does have some cool special effects here and there and it moves along at a quick pace the performances are generally good i particularly liked mark ruffalos laidback hulk its got some very cute moments sprinkled in although they feel a little lost among the endless battlesits a good movie and if you want a fun popcorn flick this would be a good choice but its not a classic,fantasy
its goodenough entertainment for what it is and what it is is ok by meultimately a cgi superhero bun fight with lots of noise and eyemelting visual fx indeed there is some significant measure of wit and gravitas in the principal performances and its altogether in summation a very jolly nonthreatening and unchallenging exercise in popcorn artistry on a grand scale and you know pretty much how its going to end before it begins so no need to worry about any of the characters or invest too much concern or emotional currencyworthy of all the hype resultant adulation and strikingly impressive box office cashcow achievement probably not but then thats an impossible reputation to live up to its never going to be as good as its made out to be in terms of most peoples honest expectations  even if they feel they cant admit it  but then again whatever is the first hour is moderately tedious and draggy and takes its own sweet time about reintroducing characters thumbnail sketching them and setting up the story a bunch of aliens are waging war on the world coordinated by thors evil brother loki the world in this case is manhattan why who knows just is only a brave but mismatched band of spandexwearing armourclad godlike or accidentally mutated superdudes stand in their way not exactly original as narratives go but its only a hook to hang the cgi action on after all its not there to be inventive or innovative complexity need not apply in this particular universethe whole point is the action  a dynamic eyecandy smrgsbord of fights explosions gunfire detonating machinery devastation and mayhem in all its highspec cgi glory a beautiful computerised cartoon of dazzlingly destructive technical wizardry and on this score it delivers impeccablykudos to the cast for instilling some crucial human elements into the characters they play deftly aided and abetted by some astute dialogue from whedon the sly and selfaware way in which he overloads the exchanges between stark and banner with meaningless technological gibberish that he just knows is utter rubbish is very smartly satirical arch cardboard ciphers made selfknowing and appealing in terms of the characters though what strikes most is out of all of them the one who ends up being the most emotionally engaging charismatic and sympathetic is the one who is a complete cgi render  the hulk maybe this says something pertinent about modern cinema and modern movie acting food for thought perhaps as superhero movies go its amusing entertaining watchable and spectacularly burns into the retinas with the best of them better than batdude or spiderguy subjective but i enjoyed it more than a lot of the other stuff around there are long stretches of boredom in most superhero movies but apart from the probably necessary preamble avoids the customary slog the fact of the matter is that when superheros in superhero flicks are not doing their stuff as superheros in superhero flicks there aint much of great interest going on and it can bore is a michael bay movie with wit charm some heart and care and more of a brain in the driving seat whedon taps into the consciousness of the crowd in order to understand what makes a crowd pleaser hes a smart guy who has studied the psychology and identified where people like bay and emmerich get it wrong thus avoiding those pitfalls and getting it mostly righti enjoyed it ill probably watch it again and enjoy it again after that though doubt it will need a further revisit any time soon,fantasy
you could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons the most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film  a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film secondly though a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one so i did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one placeironically enough though the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and i think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines rather than being forced onto others the plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a manmade one again this concerned me at first because i didnt particularly care for thor and i did get the feeling that this would be more of the same with gods and mythical creatures running around to a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer which i am these aliens arent really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it in some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer batman because where one aims for darkness and introspection really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable packageand this it does across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action there are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me hulk randomly punching thor was the high point with the puny god moment being a very close second the cast go with it and i liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen downey jr is fun as normal and he works well with evans who i thought was better here than he was in his own film likewise hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun two things lacking in his own film and ruffalo makes for a good hulk again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film johansson and renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the funit is easy to turn your nose up at because it is basically an effectsdriven summer blockbuster about superheroes nothing something that always delivers but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that the is one of the good ones colourful busy fun and generally very entertaining  it delivers everything it sets out to do and i found it very enjoyable for this,fantasy
i have no idea how this movie is rated above 65the movie actually has a hopelessly predictable plota good watch for kids maybethe villain loki seems to have no idea what his course of action should behis plan of taking over the earth is a hilarious one and no thought seems to have gone into ithow he survived is not clarified in the first place thor also is also able to travel to earth despite the rainbow bridge being destroyedthere are too many anomalies which leave the viewer perplexedthe only good thing is the acting of robert downey jrthe action is okbut that is as good as it getsonly watch if you are an ardent fan of super heroes,fantasy

two weeks after everyone else saw the i finally got around to watching the film last week a lot has already been told about it by the gazillions of reviews on the internet today this review will get lost among all that noise so i chose to keep it short and simplenick fury samuel l jackson brings together a group of superheroes ie iron man  and thor chris hemsworth along with shield agents black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to have a face off with a global threat posed by loki tom hiddleston and his army of chitauria runoffthemill story about the bad guy revealing himself in the first half by stealing something powerful then the good guys get defeated in the first round to perform the knockout punch in the finale with a postcredits scene promising a sequel where it stands apart is the brilliant execution on the part of directorwriter joss whedon who not only manages to balance all the power packed characters into a dynamic package but creates what possibly could be the best adaption of a comic book into a superhero movie he keeps the audience on the edge of the seat with intense action ranging from in your face hand to hand combat and zipping around manhattan flying exploitsrobert downey jr when not suited up plays tony stark with immense amount of ease and charisma chris evans seems out of place which goes well with his lost in time character while chris hemsworth seemed a little underwhelming in comparison to his solo film act samuel l jackson had more breathing space with a lengthier role which was good to see while tom hiddleston as loki was impressive as the outnumbered villainmark ruffalo was a refreshing change after the previous actors who played bruce banner while the interpretation of hulk was the perfect hurrah for this amazing comic character thats been long overdue the respect it deserves on the big screen was a long time comingscarlett johansson sheds her iron man 2 eye candy role for something more in line with what youd expect from the savvy spy  black widow unlike the trailers jeremy renner had more to do than i expected which was pleasing and it would be great to see a film about the back story of hawkeye and scarlett johanssons characterbackground score screenplay cinematography costumes cgi were all top notch not a chink in the armor support from clark gregg cobie smulders and stellan skarsgrd was more than adequate without turning into clich ridden monosyllabic characters that have plagued recent big budget filmsthe like someone on twitter said is the star wars v or was it vi of our generation a mustwatch in the theatre though you can skip the 3d glasses if you want because i doubt it would reduce the awesomeness that is the film,fantasy
it has finally been assembled marvels decision to make the might seem like the superhero equivalent of the ensemble movie valentines day or the theory that stuffing multiple popular actors into one movie is an adequate substitute for storytelling and makes it so marketable that no one could pass it upwhile thats not necessarily not true of marvels super plan five years in the making the means something more to comic and superhero fans it is a culmination of a lifetime of anticipation that does in fact have a historical precedent set by marvel comics essentially this movie is a collective nerdgasm but whether youre part of it or not theres plenty to love about how geek godfather joss whedon tackles this gargantuan taskstill its pretty amazing what bundling seven or so of the most beloved comic characters of all time into one package can do when it comes to creating an entertaining diversion many folks will nitpick at the script from now until eternity but something needs to be said for the experience of being so awestricken that you couldnt care about those things if you tried theres no shame in covering up flaws with entertainment especially when you deliver that entertainment with a level of quality rivaled by few blockbusters of this scalethe is a nearperfect execution of giving the people what they want if you had to make a list of what you wanted from an movie whedon and marvel would appear to have read your mind the action sequences blow every previous superhero film out of the air land and sea the wit and humor come from more than just a series of punchlines or catch phrases and all the characters get a chance to shine from an action and development perspectivestory is secondary to achieving those goals thors chris hemsworth powerobsessed brother loki tom hiddleston has made a deal with an alien race known as the chitauri to destroy earth so he can rule it he breaks into a shield facility and steals the tesseract an object at the center of captain america the first avenger that has the power to open a gateway through which the chitauri can invade nick fury samuel l jackson realizing earth is about to be at war with an unstoppable force summons tony starkiron man robert downey jr a displaced steve rogers chris evans bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo and thor in hopes they can place nice and band together to stop lokiso you have high stakes global destruction and a force powerful enough to justifiably bring all these heroes together thats all you really need the script properly gives each hero reasons to fight and a personal journey something to overcome all this for seven characters in a 140minute runtime even though were building up to yet another movie climax that involves the destruction of a major american city by hostile alien forces its still this unique grouping of characters that changes the whole gameas someone who seems to specialize in creating projects that develop cult followings whedon was really a perfect choice to write and direct despite what one would assume to be a lot of pressure you never get the sense that the is trying too hard the balancing act of all these characters might have seemed too tall an order for any one man yet with actors really dedicated to the souls of their characters whedon and the cast pack in so much into even the smallest of exchangesone character the movie excels at in particular is the hulk ruffalo commands the role of banner as if he was the one who played him in the first two hulk features the script paints him as the teams secret weapon but also as the most volatile link in the chain some fear the green monster others tony stark try to provoke him either way despite sharing screen time this hulk is both more brutal and emotionally accessible than ever before more than any other character youll end up most curious about what marvel might do with him nextin general the lack of time needing to be spent on plot development gets rationed off to all the characters allowing the thirdact action to pay off in more terms than simply eye candy each hero has a personal story arc or obstacle to overcome whether its tony stark proving he can set aside his ego or captain american understanding that he can be relevant in the 21st centurywith so many heroes in one film hiddleston had to bear a ton of weight as loki creating a presence that could balance out all these good guys although not much of a physical threat his the jokerlike move to allow himself to be imprisoned gives him the fuel to be cunning and unpredictable in performance and in actualityfrom a pure entertainment perspective the should be considered king of all superhero movies what it lacks in thematic and character depth it makes up for with action and humor whedon writes so expertly around clichs and identifies ways to make the film naturally funny and the way the action scenes are edited together theres no confusion in regard to whats going on despite the chaos of the chitauri invasion scenemarvel deserves all the credit in the world for building to this point and delivering precisely what fans wanted although anyone can enjoy this romp not just those who saw both iron man films thor and captain america theres no doubt the legwork in those films makes it so much easier to enjoy the entire dynamic of the what a momentous achievement from a business filmmaking and audience perspectivesteven cthanks for reading check out moviemusereviewscom,fantasy
the is a smash this movie was very well written and was action packed the entire movie no kidding it had very little profanity and no blood except for the part where loki thors brother takes somebodys eye out with his staff it does not show up close view but anyway i would tell all my friends about this film dont take kids under 7 to see it just for the action part of it i will make this promise if you see it you will love it if you do not love it sorry movies are not your thing also a shout out to robert downey jr aka iron man he did great but the mightiest avenger is the hulk dont mess with him i know i wouldnt marvel you did it again very great movie thanks for reading i am alex adams for movie usa,fantasy
just got back from seeing the and have to say that i enjoyed it it had a non stop feel and some of the best action sequences ive seen is it a great action movie absolutely is it one of the best superhero movies ever im not an expert in the genre but i bet it is was it one of the top 50 overall movies of all time no wayi was really shocked when i saw an imdb rating of almost 9 for this movie and im hoping that over time cooler heads will prevail and bring the movies rating down into the 7s where it likely belongsi found that the writing was fine for an action movie but i certainly didnt lose myself in the reality of it all there were a number of sequences where the dialogue and interactions of the characters was not believable or compellingi apologize to those who would quip that dramatic dialogue and characters with whom the audience can empathize dont belong in this type of film but i think they do and im sure well see it somedaygo see this movie  well worth the trip to the theater to see it on the big screen savor the amazing special effects and action scenes that are so well put together please dont suggest that the film ranks with some of the all time great works of art that have made it to film,fantasy
i watched this movie in india while on a stint there the audience was mostly adult groups im not sure how much the crowd knew about marvel or its comic book characters but i can surely say that they loved it i was extremely enthralled to see all the superheros in a single movie and it far exceeded my expectationsof all the characters in the movie the one that i was impressed most is the hulk mark ruffalo played this character to perfection no other actor might have done this role that excellent as mark did the portrayal of a human side to a person considered superhero as repeatedly demonstrated by hulk is what endears me to hulk as my favorite comic book character everrdj the chrises evans and hemsworth were impressive as well the roles of hawkeye and black widow could have been enlarged a bit more and renner and johannson respectively played it with aplomb the villain as played by tom loki could not have been any meanerthe screenplay fitted with witty lines and laughs thrown in between proved to be great as well my hearty kudos to joss whedon for bringing together a spectacular show on screen the music from alan silvestri was appreciable toolooking forward to the sequel very soon and the next one should definitely have spider man and xmen as well to make it more entertaining than everganesh,fantasy
saw them all iron man 1  2 captain america thor hulk both of them and anticipated the arrival of the and man what a fun movie it was thought the way the set them all up was executed very well didnt really have a back story going into the movie about the black widow character but her opening scene sufficed thought the hawkeye guy was a cool character but didnt really see how he was a super hero in a sense if that makes any sense hulk captain america thor are definitely genetically super heroes and iron man is by ways of modern technology but come to think of it black widow is just a real devastating woman who stands on her own and hawkeye is also kind of just a guy thats a real good shot but end of the day theyd all be great back up if nonfriendly aliens came down for a visit not wanting to give away the story just like to add that the length of the movie didnt bother me at all the character development and was loads of fun really enjoyed getting to know characters again,fantasy
im coming out straight up to say this is he most freaking amazing comic movie adaptation i have ever seenbest movie of 2012 best marvel adaptation everi have to say what he freaking  fuzz i cant believe ive just seen a movie as great as this from hollywood where could it ever go wrong from cast ensemble to character arc to character development to story to omg spectacular kickass action pause to catch my breath my mind is still spiraling from what i have just seen this is a movie i want to watch this next minute if i have he chance my only downside to this movie though is not seeing it in time oops ha that is no downer to he movie itself it made me laugh get tear eyed marvel in wonder at pure awesomeness jump out of my seat tremble in fear its just great sorry i cant find he words still as large as he hype to this movie is it still didnt do justice to how awesome this movie is goshgreat job joss whedon he really is a passionate comic book writer who does justice to this ensemble shuffling up things to boiling point between characters and i cant even start to describe his major villain whose actor gives an oscar worthy performancenever had a badass bad guy that kept me awestruck this much since he matrix tom hiddlestone does justice to this character in a way that truly signifies a real god of mischief scheming and plotting with thoughts and plans coming at split second intervals tom hiddlestone still gives his character that dynamism of a brainiac with deep inner pain that youd think could boil over at any momentmind blowing movie for a super hero generation if u are a comic book fan you would drool over this movie and im not just saying if you are not even theres no reason why you shouldnt watch this movie still it just couldnt go wrongpanting,fantasy
i loved iron man and thor enjoyed captain america the first avenger and was slightly disappointed in iron man 2 but even the best of those movies were just a leadup to the which is absolutely one of the finest superhero movies and one of the most entertaining movies of any kind that ive seenthis is pure summer blockbuster fun and i dont mean that in a way that limits the movie but instead as an example of the best of what a summer blockbuster can be the story is rather straightforward a massive threat to earth thats too big for any of our heroes to handle alone and a rocky road of butting egos and misunderstandings stands between them and working together as a team its clear easy to follow and only has the briefest moments of lost momentum the feels like its the perfect length with no action scenes that drag on too long into mindlessness or uneven pacingwhat struck me most about it was the humor it carried the movie even more than the excellent action scenes the wellhandled exposition or the interplay between our heroes the is outright hilarious at times the laughs are woven organically throughout the tone of the movie just feels right which is probably the best compliment that i can give iti must say that my expectations were easily surpassed by the first assembly of the earths mightiest heroes marvel definitely made the right decision to carefully lay the groundwork for the the past few years and it paid off and it helps immensely that they chose the right man to write and direct it cant wait for 2,fantasy

one of the most entertaining blockbusters of all time the may not have the perfection of the holy grail of comicbook adaptations ie the dark knight or even batman begins but its significant emphasis on perfect balance of humour  action throughout its runtime makes up for a highly rewarding experience that is far greater than what most films of its genre ever manage to come close tosix marvel superheroes in one movie same savetheworld bullshit that we have seen  been disappointed with countless number of times and yet the works in an unexpected but very effective manner and is bigger better  far more amusing plus enjoyable than all the previous films of the marvel cinematic universe combined and succeeds in surpassing all hype  expectations with surprising but stunning easeas for the plot summary when the tesseract suddenly activates at the shield research facility and opens up a portal allowing loki brother of thor to reach the earth  begin his mission of enslaving the whole planet nick fury director of shield reactivates the initiative thus bringing natasha romanoff dr bruce banner tony stark  steve rogers together who are later joined by thor  clint barton to stop loki from succeeding with his planthe direction is extremely good as joss whedon has crafted an impressive piece of eyepopping action extravaganza and to make sure that the film is not overloaded  tiring filled it up with loads of humour the screenplay is witty plus the comic timing is brilliantly executed cinematography  editing is carried out amazingly well and the original score by alan silvestri is a major plus as it strikes the right chord from start to finish thus enriching the whole experiencecoming to the performances its robert downey jr who delivers the strongest performance amongst all as tony starkiron man and thanks to the amazing wit charisma  charm this amazing actor always brings to the screen with finesse its almost impossible to not like him yet the one who manages to steal the show in the end is none other than mark ruffalos terrific rendition of the hulk for he was absolutely merciless  unstoppable and even tom hiddleston as loki manage to impress with his chilling performanceon an overall scale the is an ambitious adventure for the masses containing all the right ingredients of a genuine blockbuster material and the best thing about it is that nothing gets overdone as every element is present in its right dose be it action humour drama etc an astonishingly great initiative that will satisfy the majority of its viewers with its wildly entertaining funfilled rollercoaster ride this is the perfect popcorn entertainer for all ages,fantasy
i just love this movie a great action movie that will keep you on the edge the entire time it was one heck of a feat to make sure all of the characters got enough time on the screen and they did this wonderfully i am going to say this do yourself a favor go see this movie bring the family tooi do have 2 problems with this movie the first is the conflict that is supposed to exist between the characters from my view there was much of a conflict just a difference of techniques or views second problem i have with the movie is that it was too short and there wasnt any cameos of any other characters that could have been involved with the film no spidey or wolverine or fantastic four involved in taking out an invading force picky i know but so much was great with this film trying to find something bad with it was much harder,fantasy
spoilers comic book movies should always be written and directed by people who love comic books joss whedons genuine love for the genre comes through in every frame of this blockbuster there is something for everybody it is an over the top energetic thrillride funny and totally fun movie rather than treating the characters with deadly seriousness or turning them into jokes in tights his respect for the disparate back stories as already told in the preceding movies ironman thor and both hulk attempts shows though and he somehow manages to bring them together in a totally believable and yet still 100 comicbook wayhe also understands that aside from the absolutely amazing wow special effects this is still a character story at heartin a less complex directors hands you could just have the all be perfectly reasonable and noble and have fury send out lovely engraved but cryptic invitations which they would all politely accept sit them all down around a round table and explain that something big and bad is out there and they must virtuously and selflessly sacrifice their lives to the common good and they would of course being heroes immediately acknowledge their moral duty and already being suited up in their cute costumes with capes and leather and tights and armor begin the battle for earth without even stopping for lunch of course they win heroic music swells and the credit rollthats the way someone who doesnt really understand the genre may have approached the filmnot joss our heroes come from all over the place and only one is already on board with the avenger initiative the rest have to be persuaded so how do you get all these guys in the same room and playing nicely on the same side when one had been brainhijacked one doesnt believe the cover story one doesnt even want to be there one is certain this is simply a personal fight one has nothing left to lose and one superspyintelligence gatherer is being pulled into an epic war with superior firepower do they all just suit up because nick fury tells them to in a deeply rousing and inspiring speech nope they walk away with varying degrees of disbelief and ihavemyownproblems attitudes and snipe and snarl at each other bicker and fight like a bunch of siblings in the middle of a testosterone war apologies to black widowand when superheroes fight well lets just say things get broken up a bit they only begin to work together when everything is falling literally apart i guess falling to earth in a broken insert major spoiler here nah not gonna do it will do that to a team of course they werent all on board the  but they all did literally succumb to gravity in their own way everyone gets knocked on the head a bit shakes it off and realized they had better do somethingworking in pairs at first then cross teaming they finally get to the point where captain america is calling the shots with all the assurance of a broken military general who is finally in his element and completely understands his troops only then are they thebut they still annoy each other maybe just a littlewithin the scope of the main save the world from a terrible menace plot there are smaller interwoven stories many character reveals and of course as this is a joss whedon project completely believable and absolutely hilarious humor sprinkled throughoutthe big bad loki is as complex as any other character and is much more menacing than in the thor movie less dare i say comic book two dimensional in lokis determined and demented quest to be loved feared and revered even he understands on some level that he is manipulating forces that he cannot completely control but he continues to play his part in the game with a grim determination and certain maniacal glee at the thought of beating his stepbrother down who cares about the puny humans they are ants he is the bootthere is a lot of fighting amazingly realistic effects spectacular settings and many surprises a few questions are answered and some more are raised my biggest question has to do with the hulk if the end is true then why the first time hmmmm i have a theory but will see the movie again tomorrow to see if it bears outquibbles were few and were drowned out by the completely immersive fun of the overall experience and as we learned from the other marvel movies stay until the very end of the credits something happens and then later a small but funny scene just stay and see if you can count just how many special effects companies were involved i saw it in a regular 3d imax was sold out pouts in a nearly sold out theater and suggest that you see it in 3d too i cant believe that joss has never filmed in 3d before it was handled masterfullywhat a ride i can hardly wait to see it again,fantasy
i was stunned by the incredible performance its an amazing movie and all of you have to watch it its very funny and is actionpacked the hulk and iron man has to be one of my favorite characters i usually dont like a lot of movies because theyre predictable and boring but you have to take my word on this the is one of the best movies ive seen this entire year you will not regret putting your money into watching this the graphic was very detailed and it looked very realistic and the story line was fun and it will keep you in your seat for the entire time i had to hold in my pee because of this you dont know what youre missing out on,fantasy
it once seemed like hollywood would never realize how profitable comicbook to film adaptations could be if handled properly but eventually they came around since then superheroes and villains have been setting the box office ablaze but theres always been one problem with these summer season mainstaysall of the characters were isolated in their own pocket universes we could never see spiderman kick back with the human torch superman could never run across green lantern well here comes marvels the mta to do away with this shortcoming from here on out there can be no going backthe plot to mta sees loki tom hiddleston partnering with a maleficent race of beings to conquer earth nick fury sam jackson the head of shield takes issue with this and thankfully has a contingency plan up his sleeve called the initiativeiron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner come together with some wrangling by shield to stop loki but before they can work effectively as a unit there are a few bumps to be smoothed outthe first 90 minutes of mta leads to several instances of one constant of superhero teamups that is before they can work together the good guys have to kick each others asses for just a bit these hero vs hero battles are tremendously satisfying thankfully the reasoning behind all of the interavenger bouts is also sound so you can sit back and enjoy the visuals without feeling as though you have to turn your brain offwhen loki escalates his plan however all differences are put aside as the assemble during this final act every member of the team gets their moment in the spotlight one who happens to be green gets severala particular highlight for me was a bit between the hulk and loki that played like something from an old warner bros toon anyone whos seen the movie knows what im talking about besides that theres thor calling down thunder captain america laying an up close smack down on the baddies iron man zipping and dodging through the urban chasms of nyc and black widow and hawkeye sniping hostiles and snapping necks if you find yourself feeling anything less than 100 involved with whats happening on screen consult a physician or check the power level of your positronic heartsomething is clearly wrong with youwhen the dust settles the bad guys have been thoroughly trounced the good guys are all on good terms as they ride into the sunset nick fury is still looking like the zenith of cool and things are set up for the as of yet unannounced sequel in short mta did its job admirablyevery actor brought their character to life special recognition to ruffalo and middleston ruffalo was able to take a character thats been portrayed by four different actors bixby ferrigno bana and norton and still lend it enough pathos to make it his own instead of being evil for evils sake middlestons portrayal of loki depicted a tragically flawed being driven to the brink of insanity by living in the shadow of his brotherwith the introductions relegated to the solo films the script was free to move along briskly at the same time it was never afraid to slow down and flesh out details that otherwise wouldve left things feeling disjointed the sfx were superlative the hulk not only looked better than ever his face resembled the actor playing him the shield helicarrier looked surprisingly plausible the hostiles looked imposing and their flying behemoths were terrifying but the major contributor to this movies success i feel is director joss whedon the guy was able to take the reins of four separate franchises simultaneously and never once lose control i thought such a feat would be impossible for a single director to achieve i still think so unless the director happens to be joss whedon theres no rulebook for helming a project like this yet he still hit a homerunkudosmta does have its snags the first is if you had a problem with iron man captain america the hulk or thor in their solo films youll have the same problems with them here i took issue with captain americai gave the first avenger a 1010 on this site because i had my head up my ass and didnt notice what a fanboy i was being well the deficits in that film translated to this one the good captain doesnt feel anywhere near as skillful or formidable as he should theres a scene where rogers sans shield is pinned by machine gun fire in the comics the gunman wouldve been eating that weapon in three seconds flat but this isnt the comics as the scenario played out complete with rogers picking up a weapon and unsuccessfully returning fire it made him feel less like a supersoldier and more like a regular guy in blue spandex yes in the final act he got a chance to shine but it did little to balance out how poorly hed fared in the proceedings up to that point the second problem i had was a minor one about rogers new costume the red white and blue stripes should completely wrap around his waist without that his costume looks like blue longjohns from behindregardless marvels the is a really fun enthralling ride that needs to be seen to be

mightiest heroes its an outstanding animatedseries that further fleshes out the world these characters call home in a way liveaction simply cannot,fantasy
im writing this review from the perspective of an avid comic book collector and fani absolutely loved the action in this film from every one of the main characters they fought like they do in the comic books especially captain america it seems as if he had plenty of time to practice with that shield of his the choreography of his fight scenes were better and he showed the agility and super strength this time out chris evans was very solid in portraying him and acted like a true captain very authoritativeeven thor used his hammer to its full capacity making the most out of it he used it to absorb and block kinetic energy dish out energy in return and he just felt more powerful than he did in his introductory film he was a bit too serious in the film gone was that positive attitude thoughiron man was his usual self mostly there for comedic elements sometimes it took away from the solemn tone of the action scenes there were just too many jokes in the heat of battle and found it hard to laugh at times during his jokes one thing i loved about his fighting scenes was how he used captain americas shield to deflect his beams so so cool well choreographed now the hulk in a nutshell well he stole the show thats all im going to say he looked so much better then he did in his film just several years ago my how technology progresses in such short time now the supporting cast did ok black widow got more screen time then i expected she is fun to watch a great tough actress johansson is as is renner too bad he was limited in his action i wont mention the other performances by paltrow jackson and skaarsgardsthey were all just solid and shortplotwise well nothing that complicated it was a sublime story but simple when looked above the surface aliens invade through a stargatewormhole dark and evil energy is brought forth by the main protagonist who was fantastic as usual hiddlestone was just as menacing as he was in thor a fine actor indeed acting wise he stole the show and threatened mentally more than physically that is rare in a marvel filmnow if a marvel film would only have a top name directing it i mean dc movies get the best directors donner burton snyder and nolan am i missing one the felt too confusing at times a comedy for the most part yet having the violence and action of a war film i didnt like that and as for the 88 score and fantastic reviews well i cant rate a movie above an 7 if its missing a good soundtrack perhaps less cgi and a good composer would add more emotion to the film i found that the lacked in emotive substancego see it though its a hell of a roller coaster ride and one of the best comic book adaptations ever,fantasy
i would like to preface any comments i have regarding this movie with a confession i never thought the assemble would ever happen even when marvel started to weave the characters and films together rather cock handedly i thought i still felt it would be a step too far the main problem or so i thought would be to balance the characters and actors indeed the very thought of robert downey jnr edward norton replaced here by the excellent mark ruffalo chris evans and samuel l jackson in the same film is enough to melt even the hardened film fans little heart this perceived problem is definitely the films major strength the way joss whedon finally getting his props allows each character their space to shine whilst adhering to the confines of the super group is exemplary none of the team are ever neglected no matter how varied or relative their strengths seem to be the obvious odd men out here hawkeye and black widow get just as much screen time both kicking ass and burping exposition as stark or banner do its this care and attention that gives the movie its weight that even when we are watching a 20 minute slew of explosions and flying kicks we are still pondering the fragile dynamics of the groupthe action sequences although never particularly groundbreaking are never the less brilliant probably the shining light is the emergence of the hulk the hulk has had a checkered cinematic past and its nice to see him finally get the treatment he deserves firstly we get the fragile brilliant and a little kooky dr banner we are inundated with references to his dangerous other self which serves to amp up excitement for the eventual breakout of banners monstrous alter ego we really get a sense of how dangerous the hulk is everyone on the team seems all to aware of his power none more so than banner himself watching the hulk single handedly take down one of the larger sharklike alien spacecrafts was utterly beguiling and left me reeling with excitement the bench mark for marrying visual effects and emotion in this type of movie was spiderman 2 to my mind at least it was the perfect balance between caring for peter parker and believing in the power of his alter ego thats exactly what we get in spades here whether its watching thor whipping up a storm iron man deploying his tnt or captain america wielding his starry shieldanother particular strength is the films humour since batman begins we have been told that movies have to be darker edgier and more realistic and whilst i love batman begins and its sequel i am growing tired of the trend here we have a movie that is peppered with fragrant wholesome humour most of this is supplied by everyones favourite smart arse tony stark his witty one liners prop up some of the more lengthy expository scenes and give them a welcoming zip also present is whedons own brand of silly visual comedy which he honed on buffy the vampire slayer a few scenes continue past the usual action or emotional beat to great comedic effect for example after watching hulk and thor beat on a few faceless baddies we watch as they recover the scene should end there but whedon has us stay around just long enough to see hulk knock thor across the room with a single punch the moment is simple but so effective it breaks up any monotony accumulated in the drawn out action sequences breathing fresh air into the proceedingseveryone without exception comes out of the film with their heads held high even scarlett johansson impressed me as the manipulative russian spy black widow and that is something i never thought i would say i hear the argument that all the actors represented here arent doing anything taxing or game changing but no matter how frivolous the entertainment may be it still takes some craft to make the world believable its mark ruffalo that steals the show as the tetchy bruce banner it might be down to the unique fact that we have seen a few incarnations of this particular character over the years and therefore have a solid reference points in which to examine ruffalos performance its his awkwardness that is the key to this performance we had always seen bruce as a gifted but tortured soul here ruffalo plays it smoother we get a man who is seemingly confident articulate but broken it seems then that he is always one step from the hulk as he states a one point in the film the hulk element isnt portrayed so much as an accident as in previous incarnations but as a dangerous personality trait of banner himself this is a much more allegorical reading of the character and a much more intelligent one it is far too easy to write him off as an experiment gone wrong and ditch him as such banner learns to control his inner demon and tries to follow the path of the righteous man well as much as he can anywaythis film easily represents the most satisfying instalment of the super hero movie genre thats not to say its the quintessential super hero movie but its the most watchable and enjoyable movie of its kind it doesnt have the dark knights brooding intellect nor does it have watchemens genre critique but what it does have is fun i couldnt believe leaving the cinema that the film was a whopping 2hrs 20minutes long this is testament to the scripts strength and the films charm and charisma judging by the films opening box office receipts i dont think i need to urge anybody to go see this movie but if its simple loud fun you want you absolutely positively cant go wrong with the assemble,fantasy
let me start off by saying this there has been a few worries going around about the different characters and if you dont know anything about them then you arent going to enjoy this movie this i would say is not true you dont need to know the characters completely you just need to know the basics like i never saw captain america i wasnt interested i know enough though about him ie he is a super soldier that was created in a laboratory he was frozen in it and he was unthawed for the initiative thats basically the only one i didnt see i did see thor but i didnt really pay attention but i knew the gist of it you basically need to know the heroes and their powers iron manbillionaire who has a technologically advanced fight suit black widowan insanely awesome and insanely hot martial arts expertassassin hawkeyebasically a bow expert and also a good assassin those are examples you just need to know the basics before you see this movie you dont want to go in knowing nothing about these peoplethe story pretty basic ill be honest it couldve a little more  better but it was still a good story simple enough the rest of the movie is going to just overcome the story the story is thors brother loki is coming to earth to take over the world with his army of alienlooking creatures for he is jealous of everyone and thinks he deserves to be knelt down to nick fury the director of shield im not going to take time to explain it google it gets all of the best superheroes iron man thor captain america the hulk black widow hawkeye and puts together this thing called the this is where they have these heroes unite together and fight the evil as a team thats all i can really say without spoiling everything but like i said its a simple storyline but you learn to get past that as the movie progresses into the characters and the action the thing that makes this movie good is how these completely different superheroes work together and how they interact this movie is a hardcore action film but there are many funny oneliners and situations that will have you busting a gut along with robert downey who has that cocky attitude that you cant help but lovei loved the characters in this movie even the minor ones i love how they all worked together and how they went off each other some of them liked one another some of them didnt but they grew into new characters as they are trained to fight together plus the characters have problems of their own for example captain america was in a frozen sleep and the last time he was awake before all this was back in the 1940s when he was fighting in world war ii now hes awakened to all this modern technology and cars and electronics etc etc its the same thing with thor since hes a demigod hes not use to the modern world and all of its technology and sometimes that works really well for a good laugh bruce banner aka the hulk has trouble keeping his other guy from unleashing but when he does its pretty awesome along with that these heroes have to try to learn to like each other and work together which is hard for them because they are completely different people some think they are better heroes then others some think that other heroes shouldnt be apart of the but these characters develop as the movies goes along and joss whedons direction of this movie is fantastic and the writing and dialogue are greatoverall this is just a fun actionpacked and hilarious superhero movie if you want to just have a fun time at the theater you go see the it is unbelievably awesome you must stay during the credits for there is a scene in the midst of the credits that opens up into a sequel as always this sounds like a lame idea but the way they set it up you know it has to be awesome stay through all the credits as well because theres just a tiny scene at the end9510 for just being a fun movie,fantasy
it has been a long time since ive anticipated a summer movie season as much as ive anticipated 2012s and what better way to kick it off than with one of the most anticipated movies ofwell if not the decade then at least the last 5 years the was a very impressive accomplishment by joss whedon and it was well worth the wait this is one of those movies that had its work cut out for it for quite some time this was going to take some skill as a moviemaker how in the world would anyone be able to bring all of these largerthanlife characters together in such a way that it would not seem too jammed packed and jumbled up for its own good how would all of these heroes be showcased in a movie that is almost all maincharacter and lead actor and to answer those questions all i can really say is this i dont know and after seeing the movie i still dont know all i know is that it was done and it was done very well i have to admit when i found out whedon was going to be at the helm for this one i had some doubts which ill admit were only based on my lack of attention to most of his work as a writer however after seeing cabin in the woods a few weeks ago i saw what whedon was able to accomplish with what was technically a film that goes into the horror genre but really was one of the best and unique films ive seen in a long time and even though he was only a script writer for cabin anyone who knows anything at all about screenplays knows that that was one that was penned by a very talented and creative guy so at that point i was more than convinced that he could pull off something great with the and after seeing it tonight its safe to say that whedon was certainly quite up for this task if you love movies then go see this one it has the action it has the acting and more than anything and is so important when it comes to a film like this it has the story and script this is the quintessential summer movie that everyone hopes for but and this is the good part its also got so much more that makes it so much more than the quintessential summer movie so the summer movie season has officially arrived and now the rest of the season has its work cut out for it,fantasy
some people watch comicsuper hero movies and at the end talk about all the faults not me i just want to point out all that made this a kick ass fully entertaining actioncomedy movie for all ages first of all the cast worked perfect we new robert downey jr was a characterbad ass in iron man but it shines in this movie with his witty one liners some mite say cheesy but no way not if your iron man to mix that in with the seriousness of chris hemsworth as thor and team leader chris evans as captain america worked like a dream as you will see half ways thru the movie mark ruffalo as the hulk was a good choicekeep it this way seen so many playing bruce in pass movies and he is by far the best and very believable hulks c g i was above and beyond and funny ill say no more lol if ya get tired of looking at all the men cast in this movie dont worry scarlett johansson is so hot in this it makes up for the lack of woman just rent transformers dark side of moon if looking for a bunch of models all over the placein this she does a great job at looking great but also kicking ass just as hard as jeremy renner who also does a great job playing hakeeye actually it was good seeing him in action have not seen him in as much action movies he was ok in mission impossible but glad to see him in a lot more action scenes now that he is going to be taken over for matt damon in the new bourne movie matt has moved to a zoo ok gone of track all i can say to round this movie up is its action packed cheesy good and absolutely priceless in scenes spoiler was waiting for some surprise at end like they did with there character movies but i think the only thing was starks building had just an a lift on it and he was redesigning his building  first review,fantasy
so ive seen it twice now and im still finding it difficult to articulate just how great this film isusually with films that are heavily promoted and feature characters that i carry a nostalgic reverence for there is a fear that im going to dislike what has been done with it and the older you get the greater the reverence for the formative years im certainly carrying this trepidation as the release dates for the amazing spiderman and the dark knight rises close in although in truth ill pay to see anything involving spidey or batman at least oncenot so with i wanted to be there on the first day  marvel studios have proved their ability to translate their characters into cinema more than adequately with the wit and irreverence that made marvel my true love during my younger days all of the marvel movies to date have been exceptional in their own ways even the weakest of them iron man 2 imho had more than enough action and humour to make spending a couple of hours in their company a great way to live your lifewith this in mind joss whedon seemed an inspired choice to manage the first big screen outing and id been eagerly awaiting the since the post credits scene in thor and my inner twelve year old was giddy with excitement at the teaser after captain americawhat i didnt expect was just how good it was going to be and i still cant articulate why but heres a list of elementsit is the best parts of all the other marvel movies multiplied by 1000the characters are all well cast and the actors seem to be enjoying their roles  rdj isnt allowed to steal the show hemsworth keeps up the good work evans finds the humour in what could be a dry role it sam jackson is sam jackson scarlett is filmed from behind in figure hugging leather and gets a character that has the intellectual strength not to have to kick ass to kick ass if you know what i mean jeremy renner does his best with the weakest written role and only has a couple of scenes to shinemark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk is revelatory and tom hiddlestone dude was born to play loki he is terrifica plot that makes sense and seems to propel itself forward without the need for any artificial nonsense although im sure well see the joins through its multiple dvd viewings on the big screen it works and works wellaction action action 142 minutes in the blink of an eyehulk  not too much dwelling on the downside of having a big green rage machine living inside you but proper glee in the smashing potential when its appropriatequotable lines aplenty im going to put you on hold for a second hes adopted mewling quim im always angry hulk smash puny godits awesomeness writ large on the big screen joy cinematic prozac and yeahi have a girlfriend she loved it too so did my three kids and my ex wife is sick cos were all raving about it and she hasnt seen it yetthe biggest compliment i can pay it i am envious of those people who havent seen it yet i want another first timeand i want a lego helicarrier escape playset dammit i shouldnt have written this now i want to see it again,fantasy
oh my god i cant even think straight right now if you can put adrenaline passion love sex and everything similar you can think of in a blender puree it to hell and down a dozen barrels of the concoction you might just end up with a feeling similar to the one i had after watching the to say it is brilliant would be a gross understatement it would be like saying the sun is warm or the universe is decently spacious the movie is a miracle anyone who has even a slight understanding of the marvel universe or has even seen the recent standalone pictures of thor captain america iron man and the hulk could fathom the insurmountableness of the task of putting them all together in one single two and a half hour movie thats like asking to fit the hulk in a pepsi can i cant even begin imagining how one would even start with it but if anyone can do it it had to be joss whedon directori know a lot of people might be going to watch this movie just because of the lead characters but for me the pull was knowing mr whedon was at the helm for those of you havent heard his name think buffy the vampire slayer angel and firefly i have loved all his previous works and expected a decent product from him the trailers were a bit unconvincing though i must say but i was stoked enough by the time i entered the hall i was the only guy there wearing an tshirt the movie had a lot to live up for mainly decades of comic book lore and the expectations of generations of fans and i am glad to say that it not only meets them but surpasses them in hulking leaps and boundsfirst up three words  hulk hulk hulk the show stealer the show stopper the master of ceremonies the winner of the spotlight award  the hulk yanks the movie all unto himself if i loved the hulk before i revere him now he smashes he busts heads he is everything you expect from a superhero and more you have to see it to believe it his scenes will leave you screaming with joy and jumping from your seats whooping and dancing in the air hulk is the man and mark ruffalos world weary resigned bruce banner complements the severity of his alterform completely while the hulk is brutal banner finds repose in avoiding conflicts through wit when the green rage monster will break bones at the slightest insult bruce will take everything thrown at him with a pinch of salt its the perfect duality and my favorite character of the whole ensemble seeing that the hulk has always been one of the most relatable superheroes of all time the very concept of losing yourself to anger is a very humanly intrinsic characteristic and knowing this allows you to appreciate his awesomeness even moreand yes yes i have not forgotten  scarlett johansenn black widow is there too and she kicks ass like never before she is stunning and beautiful and sexy and depending on your sexual preferences the second best thing in the movie the first still being the hulk her story opens up even more and so does her relationship to hawkeye brett renner who is also marvelous in his role toothe most amazing thing in the movie perhaps is not the action of which there is tones but the amount of content that they have been able to cram into a single film the character development is brilliant and even former fringe players like nick fury samuel l jackson and agent coulson get more etched out here than in all their other movies put together all in all each character is better represented here than in their own movies iron man and thor might be the only exceptionsthe story itself is a pretty simple one with loki tom hiddelston banished from aasgard at the end of thor drifts off into space returns with an alien army to take over the world and nick fury assembles the to defend us but like they say the devil is in the details and so it is here this movie is riddled with amazing conversations and meticulously placed jokes most of them occurring in the midst of epic battles each characters relation with the other gets etched out during the course of the story and by the end what we have is a comprehensive understanding of what the are capable of  and with a major reveal at the end of the credits showing us the next villain  you realize that this was in fact just a two and half hour long prologue to what is yet to come god bless us allin short there is action there is humor there are heroes and there are villains i wont spoil anything for you by describing any scene in length or short because the whole thing is that amazing this is a ride everyone must take for the love of their inner child unlike the recent dark turn comic book movies have taken since nolans batman the embraces its roots unabashedly think of all the cartoons you watched the comics you read and the toys with which you played out fantasy fights whedon has captured them all this is a movie meant for pure joy and if you are even half as in love with any of the characters as i am you will walk out with a major pain in your face muscles from carrying a ear to ear grin from title shot to credit roll,fantasy
the gathered huge expectations since it was officially announced in 2010 when separately the marvel comic characters can rock in the movies then what massive consequences can happen when they are assembled altogether from tony stark to clint barton the group is subversive and totally heroic in their move a lot of money 220000000 is involved here as there are spectacular special effects and eyepopping destructive acts till now there is a huge chaos created allover revolving the release of the movie even in india a huge profit is estimated for the movie anyway lets see how this movie worksnick fury is the director of shield an international peace keeping agency the tesseract is an unknown source of huge sustainable energy that can come to much need of planet earth but when loki thors brother steals the tesseract and tries to demolish the earth as directed from asgard nick fury assembles the iron man the incredible hulk thor black widow captain america and hawkeye to eliminate the extraterrestrial attack on earth and save humanity samuel l jackson as nick fury does a perfect job even not being a superhero his special role as a colonel in every marvel hero movie is commendable tony stark aka iron man is said to be the salient character of even captain america is the first one of them robert downey jr as tony stark is remarkable humorous smart sleek and heroic and most of all perfect from every nook and corner without iron mans technological help and cleverness the would have to face much problemsteve rogers aka captain america the first avenger does here a nice work indeed to him saving americas glory and assets is everything and so he does chris evans as captain america was a joy to watch and he was the only hero that can stand beside iron man shouldertoshoulderdr bruce banner aka the hulk is the strongest and mightiest and toughest pillar of the even edward norton was the leading hero of the incredible hulk mark ruffalo as the hulk here also gives much justice and creates a great atmosphere of strength and destructionchris hemsworth as thor which we have seen previously in the movie named on him was indescribable he is said to be the god of thunder from asgard and here with his mighty hammer he yet again creates a great appearance and makes a strong impact in defeating enemies nothing is greater than myst and gods in that case natasha romanoff aka black widow played by scarlett johansson was effective as the only female superhero character in the midst of powerful masculine superheroesclint barton aka hawkeye was fine and he seemed to be the weakest among the but still he was effective in his negative preclimax and heroic role in the climaxtom hiddleston as loki thors brother seeks revenge on his brother and tries to rule the world as the only god so the character with so much vengeance and thirst and also battling the all alone had to be very important for the movie and so it was among all others the most important one was clark gregg as agent phil coulson and he did a splendid even the movie puts an end to his character forever cobie smulders as agent maria hill stellan skarsgrd gwyneth paltrow  more  everyone carried out their roles splendidlyit was very lucky for me to watch the movie in 3d as the remarkable special effects by chad ball roland blancaflor david boucher  more and visual effects by visual effects by shaun friedberg pyrokinesis david abbott nada abdou  more was the most important substance of the movie massive destruction aliens super natural powers  everything was excellently perfect cant be better than this also i would specially recall the use of humor in the movie that made people laugh at times also the dialogues of the movie are excellent some awesome ones like  steve rogers stark we need a plan of attack tony stark i have a plan  attack  thor hes my brother natasha romanoff he killed 80 people in 2 days thor hes adoptedeven this is the second directorial of the director joss whedon he does a commendable job and i doubt if anyone could have done it better joss pens down the story with zak penn with the help of the writing by stan lee  jack kirby the original comic book writers and gives birth to a very efficient story that perfectly got along with the movie finally when i saw in the final scene where tony stark  pepper potts were redesigning devastated stark tower and only the a stood among the five letters i was fully assured that the movie did not intend to glorify any one marvel hero but glorified their team work as and if as the end of the movie hinted is true then get ready for the 2 because nick fury said we need them and they know that very wellthe is one helluva ride of destruction fighting evil  heroism kids will love it and so will the elders make some time take your family put on your 3d glasses pop some corns in your mouth and have a epidemical time if you miss this one consider it as a huge loss,fantasy
i dont care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those people obviously have no taste anyways i just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly i wasnt disappointed the movie was actually the most epic movie i have seen so far yes i might change this decision after i see the dark knight rises or mib 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me the movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs the mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences i am sure several people loved the dialogs but i just admired them the action scenes were not overdone and were certainly better than gi joe series which was not really anything impressive for me but there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and it wasnt a waste to wait for so long the action scenes are good though there was a lot of explosions they impress the best part is the acting our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action plus the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story but this movie doesnt drag and doesnt make you fall asleep acting is top notch robert downy jr is the best thor is good captain america the rest are awesome in general this movie was damn good i wasnt bored and i enjoyed every freaking moment,fantasy
i was waiting for this movie for quite a long time so when it got released i did not wasted any time and i watched first day and first show in 3d cant say how much i enjoyed there in theater this movie is by far the best action movie in recent times6 super heroes in one movie what more you can ask from it great story line and to say difficult one why because to capture and present best thing or best part if all super heroes is really superb and character of all superhero did not over shadow of other super hero characterand direction is also changeling one when 6 heroes in one movie it is bound to happen but in this movie is does not sleek direction is there when keep story intact and in last 1 hour or 50 min or so it explode in form of best action scene and will take you to the edge of your seatso my rating for this movie is 9this movie going to break many record at the box office and a another summer blockbuster for marvel,fantasy
four years ago samuel l jacksons nick fury appeared in iron mans end credit scene and whipped the comic book geekworld into a frenzy it was a hint at larger things to come within the marvel universe and the fans knew it since then weve witnessed a franchise including the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america that has excelled in selfreferential plugs character cameos and plot crossovers all building a giddy excitement towards the main show the it was worth the waitwriterdirector joss whedon has concocted a perfect blend of mouthwatering action laughoutloud humour and eyeblistering cgi whether its the excellent thor vs iron man vs captain america rumble in the forest the mindboggingly spectacular 30 minute finale in downtown manhattan or any scene with the hulk the bruising action is choreographed and executed with a flair not seen in any of the aforementioned standalone movies and along with the series best cgi is likely to have your jaw on the ground similarly the script and dialogue is crafted with such a high level of intelligence and wittiness that every joke hits the mark  the hulks reaction to loki belittling him had me in tears  and the story roars along at a cracking pace allowing you to glide over the minor gaps in plot however perhaps whedons most amazing feat is how he balances the screen time among the mammoth cast who continue their great work from the franchises previous instalments he has kept every character in focus yet never overshadowing the others resulting in an ensemble piece that clicks from the get go the opening act may be a tad slow but this superhero adventure is a rollicking good ride with genuine aweinspiring moments bring on the sequel,fantasy
i am still amazed by this movie first i was a bit skeptic since lot of movies with big names are not that good as you may suggest but this original jokes even when you dont suspect it i laugh so hard i was crying and is not a so called funny movie like american pie the type of the characters are clearly distinguishable and is the same as in the previous movies but even if you didnt saw them you can fully enjoy it but if you did it adds something extra its full of action and even when it is not so much going on the screen you never feel like that something is missing or boring it is the perfect movie to switch off laugh hard and enjoy whats happening on the screen,fantasy
the only reason im not giving this a 1 is because you would have to be an idiot to not recognize the money effects and time that was put into the movie this wasnt done lazily just completely misguidedthere is no tone or running theme this is nothing more than a big screen version of playing with action figures just like you did when you were a kidi wish i could even recommended this for children but its so morally bankrupt you might as well set them in front of a popcorn machine and let them watch the butter meltbrainnumbingly dumb,fantasy
this movie got all the hype everyone seeing it buying tickets and loving it i couldnt see it sooner but all of my friends were telling me how great it was so finally get a babysitter and go over pay 16 per ticket to see it in imax3dand it was horrible i actually went to the bathroom and accidentally walked into the battleship theater and didnt realize it was different until i coulnt find my wife lol it was badand i like comics i hated thor but the other movies were goodand thor made this movie bad chris hemsworth should just quithes insulting robert downey jr and mark ruffalo did all they couldbut they could not save this horrible movie the plot was like something a 3 yr old would make up playing with his action figures samuel l was so generic they over used the same jokes over and over especially with captain america this was just a bad movie out of all the awesome marvel bad guysloki is the dumbest avoid this movie unless you still live in your parents basement never had a girlfriend are under the age of 7 or enjoyed transformers 3 which this was basically the same horrible over the top bad movie at least scarlett johansen was in itgave me one thing to look at the whole time,fantasy
i like some comics especially the first ultimates series and thought the second iron man movie was pretty good but the is a mess of exposition cluttered action and pandering referencessome problems1 loki is the villain terrible idea to have this team essentially fighting 1 medieval hero for most of the movie and makes them seem weak too 2 stupid proclamations about were at war seems silly throughout until the end when reallytheyre just fighting loki 3 good guys with mind control turned into bad guys is always very bad in movies 4 roughly 30 minutes of bad speeches by  conversations with loki each like the dumbest bad guy explaining himself scenes from james bond movie 5 scarlett johanson is as bad as she is cute totally unbelievable at all times 6 lots of selfconscious dialog that would play okay in a comic book not great here 7 samuel jackson should be a newscaster 8 the good build to the hulk transformation was then injured by a weightless bad cg hulk no better than the ed norton version like all thoughtless directors who dont understand physics wheedon has the huge character move like hummingbird or a gnat and thus it feels like a weightless video game as bad as the cave trolls in fellowship of the ring or worse 9 the only clever idea stark starting the propeller with his suit just happens rather than having a sequence building up to it of the ship going down and him getting in there and helping like all action scenes in the movie except the long take it is unfocused and shows rather than builds 10 if it werent for the character development outside this movie the iconography of these characters and the charisma of iron man  thor this wouldnt even be a 5,fantasy
the is the first of its kind to have several movies as a build up while some of the past movies starring the individual heroes ranged from good to bad the is supposed to be the climax of those movies after seeing it i was left a bit empty minded although i felt entertained throughout most of the movie the lack of depth got to me several times dont get me wrong its not because the story is bad as a matter of fact its better than most wegottasavetheworld stories involving superheroes but where the fails is when it comes to getting the audience out on the edge of their seats you never really believe that they actually might fail and it might be because this movie was aimed at an mainstream audience that darker themes were left out after superhero movies like zack snyders watchmen which mixed ideologiespolitics with other deep themes and nolans batman franchise  the feels more like a wellmade cgi orgy with funny moments amidst a story that fails to capture you although entertaining dont expect to walk out of the theater pondering about this movie,fantasy
let me make it clear that this along with the dark knight returns and django unchained are the 3 movies that i am really looking forward to in 2012 after seeing the in 3d my first reaction was awesome but after thinking about it more i felt let down with the story with so many super heroes and just one formidable villain the were always going to come on top so how would the story make it more difficult for the heroes was going to be a challenge unfortunately the script failed miserably in that department since joss wheadon who is himself a great graphic novel writer  was helming the multi starrer expectation was that he will have something more than just big effects super heroes movies like spiderman  the dark knight are blockbusters but have a great story to tell as well the plot is simple loki thors brother played by tom hiddlestone admirably  decides to steal some transsomething which opens the gate to another dimension from where aliens would attack earth and loki would rule it nick fury assembles the the ironman robert downey jr brilliant as always captain america  the hulk and thor to fight against the other worldly aliens the only problem is that these superheroes need to get along with each other and put their egos aside to fight the alien invasion the pros fantastic action great visual effects good oneliners the hulk the con a weak script and a predictable plotits a great watch but could have been so much better cheers,fantasy
the first 45minutes take place in the dark and thats a bummer if youre watching in 3d then the last hour delivers with a lot of mayhem and destruction but unfortunately its more of the same old same old flying robot lizards destroying new york buildings anyone didnt i see the same thing in transformers etc do they just modify the cgi a tad and throw them in the next blockbuster i wonder so much action and yet we were quite bored some funny lines here and there otherwise a disappointment from a good director movie will make a killing but im wondering how much more cgi chaos we can endure before we start giving these type of movies a skip the suits running the studios are only interested in chasing a sure thing so all were going to get are sequels and reboots wish we could get the 70s back when the directors ruled in hollywood and the accountants worked in wall street mind you i have all the best movies shot in the 70s on dvd so ill just watch them over again until i get my mojo back,fantasy
i appreciate this film for what it is an all out action popcorn movie that aims to wow the audience with its cutting edge effects fancy camera work and ability to not have to think and just sit back the plot was pretty simple and nothing new in terms of old clichd alien guy tries to take over the world with his army and big doomsday device scenario with an ending we have seen a million times before with a lets destroy a city with as much explosions and cgi as possible chapter dont get me wrong they did a great job with it some of the camera work was excellent much better than micheal bays close up and shake the camera around everywhere technique but for me personally i dont like being overwhelmed with all the cgi and the camera taking me away from the characters involvement of the scene and scenario and focusing on the effects the only thing that kept me going till the end was the humor if it was not for that i would have rated this film as just another bland cgi bonanza a good attempt but for me not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be the effects are amazing the humor is good but everything elseseen it beforebored of it,fantasy
i dont understand how this movie succeeded in scoring so many stars the only thing good about it were the visuals seeing hulk smash and all that story line characters interaction were all very flat ive seen previous titles in this series like the uberhorrible captain america hulk thor and iron man and it seems clear what this series is about flat visual action scenes pure for visuals it deserves three stars but since so many people are exaggerating on their score im giving only one to compensate it does definitely not deserve the high score it has nowright i need ten lines well i can repeat the script to show all the silliness in this movie banner cannot control hulk inside then suddenly he can anger himself out of will out of the blue hulk suddenly evolves into a cooperating creature what how does that fit into his history and then that old man who saw hulk falling hes reacting as if he sees it everyday captain america needs a suite because people can use some oldfashionedness huh then when action is required he asks hawk eye do you have a suite huhu very important indeed whats it with his shield anyway iron man keeping a rotor running by spinning it himself come on please mythological gods as science fiction figures no dont mess up that i just feel like i watched my little brother play a video game lots of visuals no story,fantasy
watched it not all that good at all for example why does hawkeye have more than enough arrows while fighting against the but as he joins em in their fight runs out of arrows why does hulk go berserk against everything on the shield flying boat thing but fights with the at the end without a real reason given even saving iron man hawkeye isnt even a real superhero but hits with every arrow without even aiming  at the end theres a scene where he blindly shoots to his right of course hitting the target sorry for the random rant liked that film either way but couldve been better   and of course spiderman was on a vacation while new york was invaded by invincible aliens duh,fantasy
i dont see why everybody has liked this movie so muchi did not like this moviei think its a amateurish take on teaming up the superheroes to entertain the audience most of the jokes and oneliners are outdated and you hardly feel like laughing at them except for few from the man the iron man   the silly quarrels the team gets into turns you off the concept of getting our bad guy from out of space the powers of whose almost are like supernatural is totally unimpressiveall in all i would say only kids may enjoy this moviei am a big fan of marvel comics and i thoroughly enjoyed the spidermans the iron mans etc but this one except for some action at the end is a waste of time and money,fantasy
the macguffin has been stolen in a darklylit and confusing sequence and now the militaryindustrial complex has to rally its choice secondtier intellectual properties to its defence all of those guys from the past two years of marvel movies plus a chick a black guy and hawkeye to meet quotas must team up to defeat the evil plot of loki whose main superpower is getting his ass kicked in every scene and a bunch of unseen aliens who want to take over earth or maybe destroy it because well thats what aliens do they squabble for a bit and never really resolve the argument but its okay because a bit character dies mentions in his last breath that his death will bring the team together and then the team states several times that his death brought them together in case you didnt get that and then they fight robot space manateesits kind of hard to evaluate the as a film because well it doesnt really try to be a film the plot is thin and generic the characters were mostly established in previous films and dont gain any new development here theres absolutely no attempt to create interesting images or anything more aesthetically pleasing than a forest of cgi and its not even internally consistentinstead the is a series of cool moments strung together and some of the moments are indeed pretty cool although a lot of the oneliners fall flat this is probably why its been received so rapturously by the internet crowd which mainly judges media based off the number of clever animated gifs they can spawn and it is frequently fun mainly whenever robert downey jr andor the hulk is on screen but the first hour is unbearable and all the banter and big speeches in the world cant make up for the corporate hollowness at the centre of the movie in the end fanboyism is just another kind of consumerism,fantasy
i was really looking forward to seeing this film after hearing so much good feedback however when i finally saw it i was disappointed by the lack of conflict and sense of the entire film normally in films the bad guy actually comes somewhere close to winning or at least gives the heroes some trouble in this film loki seemed weak and powerless compared to the heroes most of the main characters werent needed like black widow hawkeye thor and captain america the same results could have been achieved if the hulk and iron man were the only heroes the ease that the had in defeating loki made the film boring and regrettable to watch i found myself on the verge of falling asleep during this entire film this film is nothing more than any other mundane action movie,fantasy
the is okay the movie has some weak points and strong points the strong points out weight the weak points the weak points are the script and special effects the follow a predictable formula the comic book hero scripts are redundantly formulated where a problem is created and then there is a final action showdown between good and evil the viewers then experience the same seen it and done it before special effects what make the stand out from other comic book movies is the character development the stark and hulk characters save the stark and hulk create comic relief and interesting dialogue when the stark and hulk disagree with the other super heroes their wit is hilarious i give avenger six out of ten,fantasy
this movie has been a long time coming as it had its beginning in the 2008 film iron man there would also be the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and finally captain america all these parts left some wondering could they have this many superheroes in a film and it not turn out a jumbled mess i never wondered that as all one had to do was look at the xmen films and see that for the most part those films got it right the main difference here was that different companies were involved so there may be some trouble however what we got was a film that brought a team of superheroes together and totally cranked up the action to the max yes i have to say the action in this film is better than any action in other comic book films it is not even close they gave me here what i have been wanting do not get me wrong the batman movies are still great i also enjoyed the spiderman and xmen films but this one just said this is a comic book film and people want to see an epic battle maybe even more than one so no good but relatively short fights like those found in most comic book films we get lots of action and an epic finale my favorite character on the is the hulk which explains why i did enjoy this film a good deal he was finally done right granted the incredible hulk was good too but this was the best representation of the hulk easily he was presented as the strongest by far though i nearly gasped when he and thor faced off as i never saw that in the trailers so that was a nice treat for me and he did to thor just what i wanted him to punch him through something granted thor got some good hits in too but i loved how they made it clear hulk is the strongest one mark ruffalo was also an improvement over eric bana and edward norton he played banner in a bit more nervous and skittish manner unlike say nortons who looked capable of putting up a fight without even becoming the hulk hulk also got the biggest laugh in the theater i was inso this film was everything i was hoping for and more the rest of the cast was good too as loki has come to earth to capture the power of the cosmic cube though he has someone behind him calling the shots he plans of bringing an alien force to earth so that he may become its king he does this for no other reason than to irritate his brother thor it seems he is still the same loki from thor as you still do not know what he has going on in his mind i was afraid he would not have this aspect in this film but they were able to keep it his alien force is great and this makes for the great finalethe finale has the assembling and working together to stop the invasion and it is a grand spectacle to behold so loved seeing the heroes utilize their skills and powers and every hero gets in some good hits black widow and hawkeye are expanded on in this film and they are pretty cool if i were to have a complaint it would be that there was one hero they under utilized a bit in a film with so many heroes i guess it is to be expected i was just surprised it was captain america he just did not play as big a role in the final fight as i would of liked sure he gave some orders but his contribution to ending the assault was giving the black widow a boost however he was used well in the other scenes he was in this is not a major gripe mind youjust if i can find something to complain about it is this so in conclusion i was impressed and loved this film it was great to see this band of heroes slowly unite as it was watching samuel jackson as nick fury pulling the strings to get them to work together surprised he was listed last in the credit sequence at the end because he played the most significant role in the film and was in it from the beginning to the end the way it is performing at the box office also makes me think there is going to be a sequel for sure and that makes me ecstatic as they show who was calling all the shots and suffice to say i was not entirely sure who he was until he smiled and then i am like oh my god yes see this dc and warner bros if multiple companies can come together and make an epic superhero team film then you can make a justice league movie,fantasy
i walked into the tonight expecting something fascinating instead i was given a screwed up 1st and 2nd act and a balls to the wall 3rd actthe was setting a really great tone of delving into a dark story of earths take over by loki and his army and every time the film would go down this darker path whether it be editing or poor script writing as soon as it had you emotionally and at the edge of your seat a completely unneeded joke or comedic moment was thrown in that totally destroyed the momentthis film easily could have had 20 minutes shaved off the run time and no offense to jw fans but he wasnt competent enough to direct this film had jf did this flick i am sure the tone would have been much more in line with the iron man films and of course the tone of the spinoffs thor capt america i will admit i was disappointed that ed norton didnt come back as bruce banner but mark ruffalo made me forget about ed within 3 minutes but let us all be honest here this was robert downey jrs movie from the get go the man is a great actor and he stole the entire film without even breaking a sweat others tried to keep up but i think they were unprepared and this can also be the fault of the director it is his job to bring the performances out of the cast that are neededwhat was really disappointing was the depth of character development or i should say the poor execution of it i know some folks will say you have to see the other flicks and there you get your character development but keep in mind most audiences probably have not seen the other films and walked into this one with the hopes of learning what was needed to be known about everyone keep in mind not all of us are comic fans or superhero fans and a film that is more or less a separate entry into the marvel universe came off more like a sequel instead of an initial entryas i noted the 3rd act was great the war and battles were fantastic from start to finish the cinematography and choreography for this sequence was top notch stuff it is just a shame the amount of work that went into the third act wasnt put into the 1st and 2ndanyway this is just my opinion on the flick did i hate it no not really i gave it a 7 out of 10 i just felt it could have been better,fantasy
88 really im sure the rating will drop to 7 if not 7 once this movie is released i mean come on the whole legendary movie was ended up being a big joke in a comedy movie comedy the movie was way beneath my expectations im so disappointed the whole storyline was here this is a monster from space go kill it thats it the only good thing about it was the once in a life time scene of seeing all the superheros togethereven the ultimate animation was way way way better  thor the god of thunder didnt even act like a god loki the god of mischief got tricked by a red head with big tits and oh iron man dont get me started on iron man i know hes funny and cool and watever but if this movie got another title it would be ironman 3but its still better than all the crappy twilight like movies these days and its worth watching it in the cinemaand i seriously thought this was gona compete with tdkr not even close,fantasy
i went into this movie with such high hopes i have been looking forward to it for so long now not one second of this movie was disappointing it was incredible funny the action was incredible i love robert downey he as iron man is excellent but im pleased to say that the hulk stole the show i really recommend this film not just to people who like this type of film but anyone who enjoys all type of film its awesome just are black widow in that suit all of the characters get great screen time and all of them feel in place no one is left out and the character development is something to congratulate whedon on this film has everything in it and i was so surprised by the humour because it wasnt cheesy it was well done and clever i look forward to the sequel i do however feel sorry for nolan for his film should be overshadowed by this film in fact all films this year should be i might just go see it again all of you should such an achievement credit joss whedonbravo and now that i have put spoilers just wanna say hulk vs loki was one of the greatest scenes ever just pay to watch that scene and that merely will be worth the money,fantasy
the is mindblowing nailbititng entertainment it works on every level  leaves a solid impact and i must admit after a long time i had such a blast at the movies the synopsis nick fury of shield brings together a team of super humans to form the to help save the earth from loki and his armythe brings marvels greatest heroes together  lives upto the expectations completely each sequence is interesting while the actionsequences are incredible the climax in particular is the mother of all climaxes its explosive bombastic  stunning joss whedons screenplay is terrific as it offers solid entertainment in those 144minutes the without a shed of doubt is amongst the greatest superhero films of alltimes yes its that great a film joss whedons direction on the otherhand is brilliant actionsequences are truly incredible cinematography  editing are good art  costume design are fabulous visual effects are fantasticperformancewise robert downey jr as iron man chris evans as captain america mark ruffalo as hulk  chris hemsworth as thor all are topnotch ruffalos hulk stands out as hes the strongest among all  gets the best moments scarlett johansson as black widow is superb jeremy renner as hawkeye does well as always tom hiddleston as the conniving loki is excellent samuel l jackson as nick fury is perfect cobie smulders as maria hill is decent clark gregg stellan skarsgrd  gwyneth paltrow appear in cameos on the whole the is a winner all the way i had a blast two big thumbs up,fantasy
i know a lot of friends who really liked this movie and happily i also know some friends that didnt like it at all just as me when i first saw it not in the cinema obviously knew it would be a waste of money i thought there at least would be some fun scenes with tony stark or some epic fightingscene but they never came so the actings dull the fightingscenes are lame and the music is awful but the biggest problem of the all must be the lack of tension in this movie as you watch the movie youll know exactly how the ends gonna be like and that no important character at all will die usually im able to see superhero movies over and over again but ive only seen this movie once and a half thats how boring it really is,fantasy
i just saw the movie and still dont know what to say about itits funny that real everyday people write real reviews on this moviesite and the next entries placed above the reviews are from fake accounts giving this movie 8 or 10 starsreal talkthis is a 5 star movieits good but not great the is first of all not the best movie ever made nor is the better than the dark knight or even spiderman 2 if someone tells you different  they may have the mind of a five year old the action is good and the characters all play their roles great but something is missing in this movieif the main villain loki and his crew of aliens became a threat to any city in the us i would laugh and take my chances am i the only one wondering where were the usairforce marinesarmy or even the navywhen a whole entire city is being attacked  who were the aliens shooting at when they came from outerspace  they sure wasnt hitting the people running around in the middle of the street during the entire battle scenedid any hardworking bank employeecopor other random person running in the street get hurt i didnt see any bad writing and action sequences ruined this movie i was also wonderingcouldnt thor just electrocute most of the aliens for about 30 mins instead of fighting them one on one he can control lighting i would still say this movie is entertaining but watched by fans and viewers with common sense  this movie is a comedy and very very very overrated,fantasy
this movie is rated as an 88 at the time of my writing this and i fully expect that to come down considerably now that all the fanboys and girls are finished pumping it up the characters could spend 2 hrs napping and the fanboys would still give this movie a 9 or 10 its like that with any movie franchise  those most predisposed to loving it are the first ones to see it and rave about it as well as overlook the obvious faultsnow that the rest of us are going to see it and review it that rating will reflect what the movie really is a cgi fest thats really kind of mediocre if it werent for the very funny moments that punctuate the film this movie would flatout stink its riddled with cheesy clichs and seems more geared towards 1013 yrolds than to adultsi really like iron man loved im2 enjoyed thor and was indifferent towards cpt america this movie was definitely the weakest,fantasy
aside from a few points of humor this movie primarily features only endless lame fighting a knocks down b b gets up and knocks down a a gets up repeat over and over and over apparently delightful to marvel fans tedious and banal to those who seek something other than the simplistic wellworn pathway to adolescent male fantasy yes the special effects were well done though somewhat inconsistent  why is the hulk so huge in some scenes so humanscale in others why does the hulk fear his monsters uncontrollability when it seems perfectly coordinated with the other superheroes during the fighting and perfectly peaceful afterward why is there no character development whatsoever oh right its marvel superheroes in stasis throwbacks to a stupider time i kept waiting for it to get interesting and then it was over sigh,fantasy
first of all id like to say there really arent any spoilers because there really isnt a story its all eye candy and if there were spoilers i wouldnt mention them here the hulk in this movie unlike its previous incarnation is modelled on a gorilla yes king kong i didnt like that at all its look movement and facial expressions i wanted to see a powerful superhuman not a monkey in a circus youll know what i mean lolthe reason i gave my review an extra star is because there were moments where i laughed it is funny but this doesnt make up for the weak clichd story and forced boring dialogue cut scenes between action sequencesthe other star goes to the setting and set designs which were appreciatedthe acting was good but the films action reminded me of a wwe royal rumble match cant wait for the dark knight rises it may raise my iqthanks,fantasy
everybody seems to like this film i dont i respect everyones opinion but i must say im a little puzzled by the public response to what i consider to be just an average popcorn movie the storyline is weak but everyone seems to agree that it isnt the most important element of the film its major points are 1 the action 2 the relationships between the characters with regard to the action scenes i felt nothing but indifference the main reason is that i cant stand cgi everything seems flat and unreal and the is a cgi fest if you like that sort of thing youll love it if you are an oldschool action movie lover youll probably be bored as for the relationships between the main characters i was even more disappointed dialogues in the film are just an endless series of supposedly funny jokes the entire movie plays as very loud and expensive comedy i cant stand robert downey jr anymore someone had said that he is tony stark but the fact is that tony stark is robert downey jr hes not playing a character hes just being a wiseass actually he does it in every movie hes in its unbearable the other characters are equally bland except for tom hiddlestons loki this mans a great actor and maybe mark ruffalos david bannerhulk overall i was bored and even embarrassed to watch the movie even though im aware that i have the minority opinion,fantasy
some fun moments butway too long way too much of everything when nothing matters when nobody is vulnerable why the hll should we careif it wasnt for the glimpses of comic relief this movie would be unwatchable i hope the kids disagreethis is meant to be a matine not lawrence of arabia epic  it just doesnt have that depthif hollywood was famous for one thing it was keeping things lean and mean this is neitherthe opening sequence makes absolutely no sense like david mamet said cut the first reel and we would still be fine this is more than true in this film,fantasy
this movie might have been worth my time if the director had spent a sliver of his time focusing on something beside obvious comedic quips a blind person could have seen every part of this movie from 200 miles away oh wait never mind we have the awesome character hawk eye to do that for us whips out his bow and looks like a little child compared to iron man and thor and the hulkat this time im laughing and wondering why he was ever written as a character as well as what is this random red headed woman doing in here either perhaps i am being harsh not a lot of the blame is on the director himself its just 6 utterly awful annoying type a characters that all need the camera time of a full movie to be cool coming together in one movie tired together annoyingly by an awful samuel jackson character and with such little background explaining so many twists in the plot look now im running around in my sentences i literally am lost in trying to combine all the horrendous things about this movie into one review perhaps if i wrote more reviews id be better at this anyways thank god for the saving grace of over accomplishing graphics allowing me to see how sweet the hulk can really be otherwise i wouldve given this a one oh just while its on my mind jessica alba plays a better supporting female chick than scarlett johansen i would write more about the utter expletive of this movie but in order to do that id have to watch it again to remind me of all the little expletive i despised and frankly i dont wanna waste my money doing that besides i am tired from staying up for this midnight showing anyways so disappointed this movie couldnt be as sweet as the spider man preview i saw 5 minutes before it,fantasy
i am a firm believer that every film should be able to stand on its ownthis was a heavy action packed movie the fight scenes were well choreographed and the cgi was well done the script cast some stellar characters with interesting backgroundsin theory this movie should have been tailored to my likingunfortunatelyi spent the first half of the movie dead bored and wondering how much was left what this film lacked was character we didnt see any depth of character it doesnt matter that the actors or actress showed great facial expressions reactions their character was never explored beyond that they remained flat personable charactersand yes i did read the arguments all over the internet thats what the other movies were for they showed character go watch those this leads me back to my first statement it doesnt matter if its already been done in a preceding movie i expect to be wowed in this movieto me this movie came off as melodramatici was the wrong audience for this filmrecommends it for marvel fans actionsuperhero genre fans,fantasy
groan i find this movie dull tedious and boring it just doesnt work on any level lets start with the heros for a start theres too many their characters only get enough screen time to be show in one shade all exempt iron man who is show to be like a god or something and that is daftthe story itself makes no sense and gives the feeling that they were making it up as they went the visuals are ok but nothing to shout about the comedy kinda works but after you seen it once it tends to drag it feels like they were trying to be funny instead of it being naturally funnythe is the perfect example of directors thinking about money by pandering to those who have an iq in single figures and an explosion fetish instead of thinking about the art of creating a good movie i would have given this film a one star but it does have one saving grace or rather three the strong acting from hulk loki and captain america drag this movie though by the scruff of its neck overall poor film,fantasy
ok now although i thought this movie was good the two things that kept annoying me every time i had to stare at them werecaptain america come on the rubber baby helmet look was terrible are you telling me that they couldnt find a better look for him the costume was terrible 1 i know its traditional but come on come up with something new the light blue was terrible and looked like a childs costume i mean the darker blue in captain america the 1st avenger was better than in 2 the rubber baby helmet what the hell it looked terrible they could have done something that came up to his ears and wrapped around his head letting his hair come out the top sorta of like cyclops in xmen im sorry the full head cover was absolutely terrible chris evans is a good looking actor show him off more not make him look ridiculous i mean if they can revamp superman costume and make it look fantastic they need to go back on the drawing board on captain americas costumethe hulk honestly i couldnt stand looking at him the digital creation they had was horrible they went from the hulk 2003 which was a bit cartoonish but ok to the incredible hulk 2008 which i think was fantastic the cgi was fantastic you could see muscle def hair moved instead of looked glued down and looked like a hulk the hulk they had in the look run down old smaller i always envisioned hulk as a big massive thing this hulk was barely towering over anyone im sorry i just didnt agree with the thing they had there at all but because they have recast the hulk like 20 times also brings down the appeal how can you really build up your appeal for the character if you keep changing out the actor that is an epic failbut other than that i liked the movie was very good better than the xmen why because they were actually fighting something bigger than the screen i hate like xmen where everyone they were fighting was the same and so small they needed to throw in an apocalypse onslaught something was the enemy is a real enemy so other than those small changes i think the movie was great for its genre,fantasy
the is an superhero action film which is amazing it doesnt leave one moment without action this film is really funny and i personally liked the acting robert downey junior and chris hemsworth it is really funny and loki is really strong villain this movie is amazing in 3d and people of all age will enjoy this film it is not as serious as the dark knight rises but it is made by marvel isnt it to experience all your favorite superhero is one film watch the and experience awesomeness the cast is really good and it follows thorcaptain america first avengeriron man 2not the incredible hulk though i cant seem to understand why edward noratan wasnt in this film,fantasy
this was hyped up to be one of the best films of the year yet im left wondering why this movie has so many accolades firstly the intensity doesnt even pick up until an hour in with a wonky storyline not worth remembering much of the plot is filler for the action which theres strangely little of an epic fail of extras ruin the continuity whilst the main cast seem to dither away into sappy buddybuddy momentswith an inflated budget it seems that more attention was focused on the characters wardrobes rather than better special effects sequences dialogue is unfortunately the usual clich bits of monologue between opposing teams leaving no room for artistic fluencyif this was the best that hollywood muster up i shudder to think what the sequel has in store for us,fantasy
if you havent seen any of the other movies such as thor iron man the hulk or captain america then this movie will have you lost it does not give you enough background information to understand some of the film for instance when natasha romanoff says to agent phil coulson that she didnt want to bring tony stark better known as iron man into headquarters because tony didnt trust her as far as he could throw her i wonder to myself why doesnt he trust her and the question is never answered throughout the film along with the scene when agent phil coulson and thor are standing in front of a computer with a young blonde womens profile opened and the agent tells thor that he got her out of the country to keep her out of danger during the battle to come the movie does not explain why she is important to thor and it doesnt explain who she is the characters do not mesh together and the acting his horrible the scene that captain america is in a plane with agent coulson the acting is horrible and the dialogue with the intended humor is bland my first time watching the film i paid more attention to the special effects and i do give credit that producer joss whedon and his crew did a decent job with that but the second time watching the film i focused on the characters and plot and i was not impressed the movie has no surprises in it the fighting scene in the end is dull and drags on and the ending result of the fight is not only predictable but clichd i do not believe this movie deserved an 87 rating because for a two and a half hour movie it does more dull action scenes then character explanation and background that it needs to make the viewer fully understand what is even going on between all the characters the most confusing relationship between two characters is between natasha romanoff and agent barton when natasha is speaking with loki they discuss agent barton a little bit but the conversation bounces from agent barton to bruce banner so much that i got completely lost if you are all caught up on your marvel movies then im sure the film would be much more enjoyable for you but as for me i was not impressed in the least,fantasy
are movies so bad now a days that a film like this is considered great whats wrong with everyone its like you have nothing new in cinema hall that you have to rate this movie 86 wtf  made a ketchup with super heroes heroes not super norse gods and ww2 heroes nothing made any sense in this movie no story worst action total trash i can call it and this is called amazing you are amazing who have no movie taste at allit really made me angry when it mock the super hero characters like hulk so hulk can temp himself as his wish when he wish  and this is called balanced everything masterfully as someone reviewed lolit should be considered as a comedy i could not stop laughing when i see that if someone is touched by lokis weapon his eyes would be blue  he would start working as lokis man and when he will be beat up by his eyes would be become normal and he would left loki rofl 86 for this trash   o o o  thats so patheticthis movie is not exceptional did not you watched any superhero movies before  watch more movies google the exceptional word for know its meaning then use it,fantasy
the is exactly what i feared it would be nothing more than a typical superhero action movie in contrast to nolans batman films it feels weak and shellless sure there are radical action scenes and the film is in many ways true to the comics however it is not what its recently and often alleged a masterpiece it is just like many previous films hardcooked popcorn action surely inspired by transformers effects but not more than that the lack of manusscript depth sound track pace and sometimes actorperformance is no where near a masterpiece the sfx as i mentioned are very well though yet a movie by comicbookfans for comicbookfans maybe that is its weakness or its only strength,fantasy
okay let me go off by saying this i say this movie a when it came out and let the record show wow this movie is wonderful some might say its as good as it gets yes people of the world it isquote on quoteas good as it gets and this is why good parts this movie will defiantly keep you watching it with joy or what ever makes humans happy this film is decent to watch with the family a great one to watch with friends and a superb one to watch by your self its high points include things such as explosions innocent civilians dying with not even a last breath heros villains okay dialogue a big green man that isnt from space thrills aliens gweneth paltrow big flying whale things that qualify as aliens a happy ending plot twist girls with tight outfits wait make that girl with tight outfit some sandwich that nobody has had before fricken iron man no charlie sheen and the destruction of new yorkyeah bad parts the director is seldom in my opinion he did some okay things buffy the vampire slayer and he has done some great things dr horribles sing along blog but for me a superhero movie is a little bit out of his league this is the biggest thing monkey flipping scarlet johansson as black widow i mean really marveldisneywho ever the heck picks people to star in block busters if you guys are just going to put in people that have you know whatwink wink nudge nudge you know what i mean you guys were practically drooling when you first saw herif your going to put some one like scarlet johansson as a superhero then you should just put rihhana in a movie about robotic battle ships oh wait they all ready did all im saying is that kristin wiig or marion cotillard would be a better black widow then scarlet is any ways all in all this movie is great just put this on a ten disc blu ray set that is over priced and everyone will be happy side not cobie smulders,fantasy
there is no way this movie could not score a fat juicy ten out of ten the assembled is a work of genius and art which is flawlessly executed this film is goldone scene flows into the next there is no spot of disorientation when one wonders how did we get here because each scene moves effortlessly and easily into the next as such it really feels as though the events are unfolding as the movie plays on not as though a story is being toldthis film requires none of the lead up movies to be watched however i do heavily suggest the viewing of thor before hand for lokis development as this films villain can not be properly appreciated or understand without knowing the evolution of his character development and yet without viewing thor the is just as enjoyable and pleasingtom hiddleston as loki is amazing he is utterly spell bounding as the only bad guy he doesnt bend he doesnt break and he most certainly requires no support he brings emotion heart soul charisma anger and insanity to a very complex role he plays loki like hes wearing a second skin he makes the bad guy extremely likable even when hes causing utter destruction left right and centreone should however not ignore the challenge that faced the whilst tom hiddleston has the burden of being the sole villain and so must not only step up and do a good job but fill such a huge space on his own with no support no back up and no assistance the have to not only work together as a team but find their own spot light every single avenger with poise and grace brings heart and soul to their character creates personal relationships with others grabs the lime light whilst allowing the others to play tooall the characters spark brilliantly togethermark ruffalo as the hulk was an interesting move hes the first hulk to be initially awkward and slightly timid but freakishly smart and seemingly cool under pressure he is also the only one to have the privilege to work with motion capture technology and so you can see mark ruffalos face on the green giant monster giving the green giant a human quality as he smashes his way through life is face paced serious fun and light hearted viewers are guaranteed to laugh out loud on more than one occasion and not be able to wait to see what happens next the film is so good that one will just want to see it over and over the enjoyability of the film is not worn away with multiple consecutive viewings,fantasy
after hearing my family rave about how incredible awesome amazing blah blah blah  this movie was my wife and i went to see it we are huge marvel fans and we were excited to see the movie our expectations simply were not met relative to all the hype and this film is not worthy of an 86 rating its a very good movie but not great by any means heres the good and the badthe good the special effects were outstanding as you would expect the acting was also nicely done the script was somewhat well paced although we both felt it started fairly slowly the movie did had some of the funniest moments of any super hero film ive seen the storyline was ok but that brings me to the badthe bad the storyline was just ok i wont spoil the movie but suffice it to say the antiheroes motivations were somewhat silly to me that said it follows somewhat to the comic storyline so the plot was never really all that interesting to begin with the actors and directors did the best they could with the plot but i was never pulled into the story that deeply nor did it strike any emotional connection or interest for me it was just a great action movie that was well acted with a reasonable script is a very good action film and worthy of seeing on the big screen however to see this film rated so close to the dark night is preposterous those films are in totally different leagues,fantasy
the is almost the definition of good time at the movies not burdened with the need to spend great amounts of time on character origins this superhero film takes a conveniently short amount of time to put the game in play and once it does that the game is played with flair and showmanshipquite frankly the plot itself is absurd but i guess that was bound to happen when you combine the worlds of five different marvel heroes in less capable hands the may well have ended up getting muddled from trying to do too much with joss whedon in the directors chair its actually a very strait forward two hours with a good level of focuswhile new york ends up getting the same treatment as much of michael bays resume the experience is far less superficial the does not insult our intelligence quite the opposite in fact it embraces it the best quality is that it never ceases to wink at itself this is a movie where even the villains the same quick fire one liners as the heroes a good protagonist of course is also the difference between good action movie and good movie simply put these people or rather super people are just good fun to be around while none of them are ever quite fully rounded when they come together as a team they seem far less superficial than they did in their individual movies with the exception of iron man the films of thor captain america and the incredible hulk were not all that memorable when it came to characters the makes you realize how distinctive each character isone thing i was a little disappointed in was samuel l jackson while he is very much at home in the role he plays it seems pretty obvious that hes just playing himself perhaps there is a hidden positive in this as a supporting character you dont wanna upstage the people who have top billings personally i think he couldve given the a little bit more lovelast summer was a somewhat underwhelming year for superheros its a pleasure then to see a film like the fly in to save the day its a film made with love and the work has paid off,fantasy
this movie is the 6th installment in the marvel cinematic universe it combines most of the original team  hulk iron man thor black widow captain americai wished that wasp and ant man would be included in this film that would be great unfortunately they did not make a debutthe movie is about how loki thors adopted brother a norse deity steals the tesseract and makes it his own power the tesseract is an extremely powerful energy source and wishes to rule over the earth his belief is that freedom is evil  they should get free of freedom the try to stop him and fight and win a war against him and his army he and thor are sent back to their home because of a portal made by the tesseractdo watch it  its thrilling and exciting there are marvelous 3d graphics according to me its an amazing continuation to others from the marvel studio and somewhat better too after all it has grossed much more than them and is marvels most successful movie yet  3rd highestgrossing movie of all time after titanic and avatari cant wait for its sequels that will release soon  iron man 2 and thor 2 will they be better an be the best films of all time,fantasy
 assemble is the best superhero film ever made i thought it was better than the dark knight and as soon as it started i felt like seeing harry potter all over again at the cinema it mainly follows up from captain america the first avenger thor and iron man 2 shield boss nick fury brings together a group of human superheroes who have different identities and events in their pasts iron man robert downey jr hulk edward norton is out mark ruffalo is in captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth with shield assassins black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye bourne legacys jeremy renner to stop a villain from destroying earth forever the massive battle scene is incredible strangely enough besides that theres a bit more laughter in this than any other sh film i dont know how the sequels going to turn out to be after youve seen this youll be asking the same question as me how will it make it bigger and better its like transformers dark of the moon but the autobots replaced as marvel superheroes without shia labeouf and decepticons replaced as the villains giant army,fantasy
i had never been heavily anticipating the im not a huge fan of any of these superheroes and havent been up to date on most of these i only saw the first iron man and the two hulk films but honestly nothing marvel released since then the surprised me it turned out to be a fairly slowpaced film with subtle character dynamics and nuanced performances okay really its just a blast nothing more has to be said it has a tone that giddily encourages you to get on board its pretty much everything you expect but it doesnt insult your intelligence in fact the characters and dialogue are all pretty wellwritten a film like this could have had just as amazing action sequences but with lesser writing and development wouldnt be nearly as satisfying truly theres something to enjoy in all of these characters particularly banner perfectly portrayed by ruffalo and the always charming tony stark downey jr having not seen thor i enjoyed him a lot too and thought hemsworth was pretty excellent technially its excellent the editing is fantastic and there is not a single flaw within the editing achievement editing action films especially in their big moments can be very hard to accomplish but these filmmakers did an impeccable job the action sequences are amazing and big huge overall theres so much excitement to be had here i dont have a problem calling the the perfect summer blockbuster it truly is and boy what a ride it is strongly recommended to everyone,fantasy
greetings allas an avid comic books fan i have mine reservations about such material thanks to some previous experiences with this difficult to work genre and essentially knowing the characters and their abilities etci wish not to burden you with ubergeekiness and so i shall strive to keep it simple and to the point as just as possible i was however greeted with an array of performances effects and credible references which absolutely satiated a void that longs for successful live action pieces of this nature and we commence with what is so often incorrectly executed with films of this category casting for me the stars of this is the asgardians specifically thor and lokihemsworth and hiddleston who radiate such charisma and fitting for the purpose it is uncanny this partially gives thanks to the script robert downy jr is arguably too old to portray tony stark now and i concur that he is better suited as sherlock holmes and not the socalled talisman of this franchise but nonetheless he delivers an enjoyable portrayal chris evans really isnt my idea of captain america at all he better fits the wise cracking johnny stormhuman torch but he is not bad and in no way impacts in detrimental fashion upon this masterpiece hawkeye and black widow are not my ideal choices from what is a veritable smrgsbord of possible heroes and neither their counterparts i was pleasantly surprised by jeremy renner though still not convinced by any means with johannson she lacks a certain commanding presence expected of a strong female i also have little to say about what i feel to be the shoehorned samuel jackson my ideas of nick fury differ greatly and the oh so human phil coulson even though he delivers decent comic relief sporadicallythis film excels where so many predecessors have failed to present characters from both a comic book perspective and one which the general public can understand their capabilities usually fall short but not in this case thor engaging the hulk in an almost even battle is a perfect example of what this movie does right the action sequences are mouth watering in some cases and everyone gets their deserved screen time with only cobie smuldersmaria hill falling shorta few minor foibles of mine in particular are some of the comedic scenes which apparently went down very well with most theyre a bit too silly for my taste black widow in the team is another the slightly slow beginning but as said previously these are hardly film destroyingif you wish for great action and cast chemistry with some very memorable action scenes and plenty of them this is a solid choicemarvel has set the very high standard for superhero team films and consequently spawned a sequel over to you dc,fantasy
this movie managed not only to be far more compelling than the below average lot of most superhero movies as well as far more funny it was great that each of the heroes was allowed to shine in the case of thor and captain america even more than in their eponymous films it was excellent to have an action movie plot that didnt try to pad itself out by adding mystery though there is some of that the dialog between characters was perfectly written to illustrate their respective personalities and how they butt heads with one another before learning to work together my one real complaint is that the hulk while a ton of comic smashing fun once he does get rolling is stretched out a bit too long with banner lamenting his fate and warning to not get me angry still thats more than made up for once he comes into his own the sequel hook at the end was also tantalizing but is probably lost on most casual viewers highly recommended,fantasy
i finally saw the i dont know what happened but it took me a while i know that there was a lot of hype built around it and that it got mostly rave reviews those who didnt like it are just trying to bring it down and that i missed out on it and i was getting tired of hearing about it my favorite movie is the dark knight so for me a comic book movie has to be really impressive the is really impressive one of the best of its kind but not the dark knightits been in the making for years the plot is simple stuff lokithe soon to be very famous tom hiddleston thors mischievous evil brother has come to earth and im sure you know what he aims to do so after years of recruitment nick fury finally decides to bring the togetherthe group includes thorchris hemsworth the hammer wielding norse god iron manrobert downey jr the arrogant billionaire captain americachris evans a super strengthed man stuck in the past the hulkmark ruffalo the big green guy with a temper problem black widowscarlett johansson the sexy leather chick who knows kung fu and hawkeyejeremy renner who has an expert mark these people must fight together but there is a problem their egosthose moments are a lot of fun and that is sort of what makes the take off there are terrific action sequences that sort of drag out but are fun anyway and the dialogue is hilarious whether its corny or intentionally funny and you can tell but its an interesting idea all of these heroes who have never met each other meeting each other for the first timethe is a blast even if it is too long even with the clutter of the heroes each one gets a fair amount of screen time and each gives a good performance mark ruffalo is a fine replacement of edward norton overall its a really good movie but doesnt reach masterpiece maybe the 2b,fantasy
marvels the deserves full credit for its dynamic execution in bringing the marvel cast together as it was a very wellstructured and firmly puttogether blockbuster by the exciting characterdriven filmmaker joss whedon the clash and the interactions of each marvel hero and the development of this was exuberant witty and simply hilarious as the film progressed into the action tone and the allout explosive warfare in new york city the teamwork and building chemistry couldnt be anymore dynamic and yet still humorous from whedons continuous comic relief of the combination of these contrasting superheroes although after all this popcorn fun simple but vital flaws remainthe score of this massively anticipated marvel feature shouldve had a magical and intense sound similar to the lord of the rings or christopher nolans batman films instead the score failed to connect as it lacked in pure epicness and beauty and ultimately the film lost connection with one of the most important aspects in a film not only did the sound and score of the film not work but the very simple story was exposed from the lack of depth in the telling of the story this ultimately made the film feel smaller and weaker than it should be with these small yet very important aspects of the film frustratingly not executed well instead of marvels the ending on a highnote it ends having zero connection with the story and characters except mark ruffalos brilliant interpretation of the hulk because the lack of connection from the score and the lack of depth in the storytelling ultimately wore on everything else that appeared on screen what lack of connection in a film leads to is a forgettable movie because if a film doesnt connect and stick with someone how can that film possibly be remembered but its marvels the how can that be forgotten very easily the concept wont be forgotten nor will joss whedons incredible characterportrayal of each superhero be forgotten but it will be the anticipation and the potential brilliance in the other huge motion pictures in 2012 such as the dark knight rises and the hobbit which will make the be that film where everyone thinks what was that movie that came out earlier this year it was a huge movieoh yeah the how could i possibly forget that its not because the film wasnt good it was an awesome and intense blockbuster to watch but it was the little things that left the film slightly over parsimplifying it down marvels the was a fun film and one for everyone to see and really deserves high praise for its execution of its characters although as glorious as it looked it unfortunately did not sound nearly as good as i wanted it too yet the film is still easily likable to any viewer because there is so much to like about in the excitement of this film,fantasy
after the events of iron man 2 the incredible hulk captain america the first avenger and thor loki returns with an army of powerful aliens to take over mankind but nick fury and his company shield gathers a group of heroes iron man hulk captain america thor hawkeye and black widow to fight backthe was one of the most anticipated movies of this year now i wasnt as hyped for this movie as everyone else were simply because i wasnt a big fan of any of the superheroes in this movie iron man is pretty cool but hulk captain america and thor arent that interesting in terms of being superheroes hawkeye and black widow cant even be considered true superheroes and overall i was disappointed by the lack of spiderman wolverine and villains from the comics this movie only has one villain loki from thor no war machine no red skull no abomination just loki but after studying the trailers a bit more and after watching all the films building up to the i myself was starting to look forward to the movie everyone were begging to seenow let me say this i have never had so much fun watching a movie its like a lot of other people also have stated this movie is so much fun to watch with other people its almost unbelievable the really is one of those very rare movies that we only get like once or twice a decade and let me tell you whyfirst of all the balance of screentime and development of the characters is very impressive its one of the hard things to do with crossovers all the characters are also made interesting and likable even if they changed the actor for hulk he still is hulk in fact the new hulk is even more hulk than the previous hulk iron man is even funnier in this movie than he was in any of the iron man films captain america is just as likable as he was in the first avenger and thor is also back in all his glorythe action is also fantastic let me tell you this the best part about this movie is the last fight scene with the vs loki and his army it is so amazing epic and packed with action everyone clapped at almost everything that came onscreen it was just plain spectacularnow the main gripe i have with this film is the setting of the midpart the middle of the film takes place in an airship most of it is just the superheroes trying to keep the ship not from falling apart while fighting some badguys its not bad by any means its just not that special this midpart is however redeemed by some amazing dialoguethe is an awesome movie its the movie marvel fans have been waiting for the midpart may not be that great but the rest of the film is so great it almost doesnt matter,fantasy
i still remember a while ago when i used to dream about seeing a group of super heroes teamed up against some evil engulfing the earth well i guess it didnt take that long just because i usually refuse to stop living until my dreams come true so when that day comes i will have the feeling i didnt have to wait my whole life for itthe are here and i must say its a wild ride into the fantastic world maybe the team is not made out of my favorite super heroes but they do come along just fine supported by amazing special effects that like so many turn the impossible into reality at least on the big screen this movie is quite a lot of fun especially if you like action its a roller coaster from beginning till the end and the story is not too shabby either but i do believe tony stark delves more and more into that self absorbing personality of his driving me a bit nuts as for the others they care for the action as much and not to be too demanding i must admit i did enjoy the journey check it out,fantasy
the is a superhero movie there are 5 male superheroes and 1 female superhero none of the characters are developed to a remotely human or 3dimensional level although the film has many moments of witty dialogue and some entertaining action scenes the plot feels as if it was made up in a few hours and the villain loki the brother of thor one of the heroes is one of the worst in recent action films if you come to a movie wanting nothing but two hours of fighting and explosions this film will exceed your expectations but if you watch films for insights on human nature to see well developed interesting characters and to see a carefully devised ingenious plot this film may not be for you however it is fair to say that this is simply an action film which is mindless entertainment and as mindless entertainment this film does succeed and for succeeding at that it earns a solid 7 out of 10 stars,fantasy
joss whedon was a great choice for a director and he always does a good job at finding the right guy to play the villain loki great collaboration from the actors with fairly equal spotlight given to the characters by far the best hulk ever ive never been a fan of the hulk until i saw this movie the only thing i thought was a tad bit cheesy were the space aliens at the end some movies have computer generated characters without it looking computer generated but these definitely looked like they belonged in an xbox360 video game im looking forward to seeing the sequel to this movie i liked the other characters who were included in this movie as well even though marvel didnt make any previous movies to introduce them i have big hopes for the new upcoming spiderman movies as well it looks like it will top all its predecessors good job stan lee and marvel studios you give something worthy for dc to compete with,fantasy
ill confess that i had reservations about the the marvel superhero movies have been a mixed bag for me so far and the notion of a bigbudget action spectacle centered on not just one but six protagonists all of whom should theoretically get an equal amount of attention sounded like a formula for disaster at best i assumed that it would be a fun slice of escapism that critics would treat with a mix of condescension and grudging acceptance at worst it would be the most ambitious fiasco since well john carter though that had the benefit of low expectations if the was anything but the cinematic equivalent of a walkoff grand slam in game 7 of the world series blood would surely be spiltto my  and no doubt tons of other peoples  relief neither of those predictions turned out to be right not only is the a blast to watch an explosive mix of humor angst and awesome fight scenes but its also maybe one of the best superhero movies of alltime take notes hollywood this is how you make a summer blockbuster despite clocking in at approximately twoandahalf hours the never fails to mesmerize barreling headlong into the chaos like an enraged hulk loose in manhattan yet also giving its numerous heroes sufficient room to breathe and flex their ridiculously chiseled muscles this is a ticking time bomb of a movie each scene brims with energy an exhilarating carefree vivacity that would probably be overwhelming if not for those little moments of unexpected pathos strewn here and there that leave you breathless joss whedon the geek idol whose previous credits include beloved cult tv shows firefly and buffy the vampire slayer displays astonishing dexterity as he juggles overthetop action set pieces with incisive often selfdeprecating banter and emotional turmoil he treats the material at once with ironic selfawareness and the utmost respect indulging the socalled fanboys without pandering to them winking at the absurdity while making his passion for the characters and their stories palpable there lies the key to firstrate superhero movies something few directors seem to have realized they may have godlike powers but deep down superheroes are still human well thor is technically an actual god but you get my point whedon refuses to glorify his characters showing them in all their messy imperfections and weaknesses so that they feel less like the flat archetypes that often dominate superhero movies than like real peoplenonetheless the star of the is its phenomenal cast if theres one thing that has remained consistent throughout the marvel movies its the acting the incredible hulk was saved singlehandedly from utter mediocrity by edward nortons compelling performance and even iron man 2 had scarlett johansson kicking ass and sam rockwell devouring scenery you might think that stuffing so much goodlooking talent into one 143minute movie would be overkill like forcing a pack of wolves to share one rabbit on the contrary the acting is what truly elevates the above just another superhero movie what makes it so compulsively watchable watching the actors  robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth scarlett johannson jeremy renner mark ruffalo samuel l jackson and tom hiddleston  together on screen is a positively mindblowing experience as a group their chemistry is fiery enough to light a small city and as individuals they alternately ooze charisma and vulnerability i was particularly impressed by johannson who manages to exude feminist empowerment while fighting in a bodyhugging leather suit and hiddleston he of the startlingly expressive eyes and deliciously smug smirk though it seems unfair to pick and choose when you have a cast as uniformly wonderful as this one this is ensemble acting at its finestthat said i did have a few relatively minor problems given the fact that the majority of the movie does such a great job of balancing the action comedy and drama i found the climax a tad underwhelming as pretentious as it sounds i wish whedon had supplemented the epic cgiheavy property damageladen battle sequence which was thrilling dont get me wrong with something more emotionally resonant it seems like a letdown to spend over two hours building these relationships only to set them aside at the end judging from the audience reaction at my screening though most people didnt have an issue with this also a familiarity with or a fondness for the previous marvel films is preferable since the assumes that viewers already have some sort of relationship with the charactersin two months the internet will inevitably be filled with debates over whether the is better than the dark knight rises the amazing spiderman might join them but to be honest that one doesnt have the same level of anticipation as the others and if youll allow me to be cynical for a second those debates will inevitably boil down to this the dark knight rises is the serious gritty one about timely political issues whereas the is the fun lighthearted one about s blowing up although both of those descriptions are accurate to some extent they do a disservice to both movies counter to popular opinion its entirely possible to like christopher nolans batman films as pure entertainment rather than profound social commentaries and although it may not have the thematic depth of the dark knight the deserves to be taken more seriously than runofthemill escapist fluff not only does it show once again that there is room in action blockbusters for actual acting but it also makes an ardent case for the importance of superheroes especially in our post911 world of constant anxiety they provide a comforting dose of oldfashioned values hope for salvation from the anarchy its unashamed optimism as opposed to the dark knights secret idealism superheroes arent here to save us from monsters it says theyre here to save us from ourselves,fantasy

initially when i first saw the trailer i was a bit reluctant about this flick  i thought it would be another good but average superhero movie after watching it however i just had to admit this was one of the best action movies ive seen in yearsthe story is a simple as that locki returns with his obsession of being a beloved king and along with his army decides to dominate earth then nick fury makes a union with iron man hulk thor and captain america the to save our planetreading this synopsis may make you think this is a silly movie but it is because of this simplicity that the is so good the story just gets direct to the point without hesitation and involves the audience since the beginning there is also some laughing moment between the action scenes  which i felt was great just to break the ice  iron man with his sardonic jokesanother aspect i felt while watching it was how it was made to be unpretentious but fun and entertaining i have noticed that some recent hollywood movies have been failing on these points  i mean sometimes they try to make action films so complex and serious  but why complicate it we are just looking forward a nice film to relax and enjoy the time and the provides it easily  at least for me it didthen mix all these aspects with a lot of explosions  yes they destroyed manhattan again  astounding visual effects and a great cast this time we have the best hulk ever with mark ruffalo the result fantastic superhero movie,fantasy
the or assemble as its called over here was mindblowingly awesome it completely lived up to my expectations and then some son of coul  i loved that all of the characters had something to set them apart that just made it so much more than your generic popcorn movie it was funny touching exciting robert downey jr and whedon are kind of made for each other performance issues i was almost worried that because of a few interviews i read where robert downey wanted iron man to carry the whole thing seeing as the iron man franchise has done the best out of all of the other individual films the was going to be iron man 25 but no oh whedon youll never fail me despite captain america being the least interestingleast dimensional personality imo of the he came across brilliantly a great balance of internal conflictstrong leadership thor was just brilliant chris hemsworth doesnt play thor he is thor that is all the hulk almost stole the entire show after all the negativity and doubt ive seen directed at ruffalo he is hands down the best banner so far and the hulk was justincredible hawkeye and widow worked really really well much better than id expected i friggin love renner and i love that he was part of a darker storyline hes so good with dark and widow was definitely more substantial than i thought shed be that was a great scene with her and loki if the villain had been cheesy or one dimensional the story wouldnt have worked but loki was amazing hiddleston aka the nicest man in show business just owned that role and although sam jackson didnt get to say i have had it with these motherfuckin chitari breaking motherfuckin new york he did get to shoot a bazooka win as well as adding his trademark wit and humour there were dozens of other wheonesque touches that really brought the film together eg the news report at the end where people were lighting candles for the casualties that doesnt really happen in most superhero movies either the entire city is miraculously evacuated or the dead arent acknowledged yeah saw it twice this weekend i am one happy fan d,fantasy
the had me lost for words the crowd in the cinema hall was cheering on cuethere were a couple of standing ovations even the laughter to the on screen repartee turned synchronous avid readers of the marvel series would deem that justice had been done to the characters the scenes where tony stark didnt get along with the rest of the superheroes were filled with comic relief i for one wasnt exactly a fan of captain america before watching this movie though i had seen him in action in the spiderman and his amazing friends show he wasnt as impressive as the people would deem the first ever superhero would be but the movie gave me a whole new perspective to the character the final scenes had people gasping in shock and awe as to whether tony stark would survive and the phone call jarvis made to pepper potts had everyone on the edge of their seats a must watch,fantasy
as 1010 as it getswhat makes marvel great is that each of their avenger solo studio films are packed with emotion and draws the audience in with relatable characters the viewer cares about them and gets invested in to their story and character development now magnify that times ten add way better action then weve seen from them in the past and you get the greatest genre work ever put to film with the this movie more than lives up to the hype i was on the edge of my seat several times during the film and i cant believe how fast over two hours flew by is the best comic adaptation film of alltime period and end of story that doesnt take away from past exceptionalism even past marvel films themselves but just delivers beyond what weve seen before from anyone as good as spiderman 2 or tdk were you really cant compare them because they operate on a smaller canvas and deliver far less notes after seeing youll know exactly what im talking about if youre being honest with yourself and fair to the movie itself,fantasy

when rather than where who and whythe man tasked with throwing all these vibrant characters into a smouldering cauldron of excitement and pure unadulterated geekiness is one joss whedon hes already created three incredibly successful television shows and an incredibly successful tiein movie in serenity but this is undoubtedly his biggest challenge to date today sees the release of the or

but one simple yet distinct aim to control enslave and destroy the earth and humanity with reluctance fury initiates the protocol which brings together the ragtag team of superheroes consisting of iron man tony stark robert downey jr the asgard god thor chris hemsworth captain america steve rogers chris evans clint hawkeye barton jeremy renner the black widow natasha romanoff scarlett johansson and the unpredictable dr banner mark ruffalowhere the had the ability to fall pretty darn hard was with the amount of material ready at hand joss whedon couldve potentially created a tenhourthreefilm epic without even scratching the surface of what drives these beings to do what they do instead in the running time which extends to just over two hours hes created an intimate and humanised portrayal of six individuals who may be gods geniuses superhuman beings and destructive radioactive experiments on the outside but all reflect deep inner trauma on the insidethe initial meetings between the characters show an element of distrust and reluctance why should one be subordinate to others when by all accounts in their own minds they all have the better technology powers or intellect with their flaws prominently on show from the beginning whedon doesnt just show the audience superheroes but he creates them before your own eyes building these characters from the inside outside he allows the audience to empathise with their plights after all thor is simply an asgardian god with family issues dr banner simply wants to be left alone in isolation to his own devices and black widow and hawkeye seem to battling those basic primal urges that come with humanity and prolonged friendshipbut one character that does continually feel out of place is the antagonist of the piece loki despite tom hiddleston creating a superb maniacal villain with thespian traits who thrives on power and destruction its hard to shakeoff the fact that loki he is constantly being undermined by those pulling his puppeteering strings yet this should not detract away from his performance which constantly steals the show whenever he is onscreen with other members of the initiative and which can be partly attributed to josh whedon and zak penns slick screenplaythe script contains some suspect writing in places especially with regards to dr banner and some of the more unusually upbeat and intellectually void phrases he spouts but aside from the odd sentence here or there whedon and penns script manages to combine the right mix or humour bravado and arrogance allowing not only each characters personality to thrive but also the plot to be continually be driven forward whether its the blossoming relationship between two prominent superheroes or the developing nature of the narrative the film is never stagnant and its this plot development which gives joss whedon the ability to let his comic book geekdom roam free in the final act with an enthralling visual actionorientated conclusionstarting in manhattan the action takes place on the ground in the air inside buildings and generally anywhere where theres an enough room to photograph a glorious all battle of good versus evil explosions saturate the air but theres also an enjoyable emphasis on handtohand combat especially when the likes of hawkeye black widow and captain america are left without their weapons beautifully choreographed fast frenetic and aesthetically pleasing the final thirty minutes are a fitting and welcome conclusion to an epic comic book movie joss whedon hasnt only managed to finally bring the six glorious superheroes to the bigscreen but hes also also managed to do it well very well,fantasy
the movie starts off slow while the plot takes shape and everyone is brought up to speed on the threat the earth will soon face a little too much time is spent with the peripheral characters black widow hawkman and fury but from the moment that one of the key protagonists first goes toe to toe with loki the film picks up pace what follows is entertaining but i think keener fans of the marvel universe will feel the middle of the film comes just short of delivering expectations for example a fight matchup that was meant for the bigscreen including two of the most powerful of the entourage left me asking for more all is forgiven though as the action gets better and better throughout and by then end when you think youve seen the finale it just keeps going the last 30 minutes of the film is the best of any superhero flick to date though i do wonder if the budget for cgi could have been spread across the earlier parts of the film less thinly the humor throughout is hilarious though at moments it risks taking the material not seriously enough as though the cameras stopped rolling and everyone can stop pretending to be superheroes one of the heroes is the butt of the joke more often than fair and doesnt get so many memorable lines or opportunities to show off like the others so if you happened to pick this one as a favorite you might be a little disappointed if not for the fact that the others in the entourage do kick so much ass,fantasy
hulk smash  the is one of the best superhero and best films ever one of the first countries to watch an early screening of the most anticipated films of this year is a great great experienced this film has a great actions acceptable comedy especially stark and hulk yeah hulkand a serious emotions all the actors did a great job portraying their role and the visual effects are amazing my favorite character in this movie is hulk i mean i hate him in the other movies but in this film whoa hes great hes strong and heavy funny when he smash thor and black widow whoa shes not only hot but shes also dangerous well overall it was an amazing experience i wanna see it again ill rate it a 85 over 10 assemble,fantasy
i just came out of the cinemas from watching it on the first day and i have to admit it was better than i expected i expected an action movie with awesome graphics and fight scenes and thats what you get world class entertainment i enjoyed the character development and subtle hints that give a bigger meaning also this movie has a chunk of comedy not the annoying kind but the kind that blends into the movie perfectly to give you a laugh but not take away the seriousness of the film too much it was clich but what can you expect the actors are flawless and keep up with who they are meant to be the only part i really didnt like but also didnt expect was the lack of feeling a lot of the good movies i watch i come out feeling different like the movie has effected me but i felt nothing except for one part but it wasnt enough to give a real feeling to the movie all in all this is an action packed movie sure to give you entertainment not boring at all funny has some smart moments and a must see movie for anyone,fantasy
that have done it i will not spoil it for the true fans out there just make sure u there all the way cos u dont wanna miss a thing i am glad that they have made this film remember this is the best yet to datei see the hulk i see iron man i see cap i see hawk i see the realism from film to out of comic book design i have read the ultimates almost like that the art in the film brings colour humor and action with a thriller u never see coming i watched it on the screen with a lot of fans next to me as i am a fan now i am true believer for life becos of one man brought a true heroes together just dont walk out at any time my 1010 is cos like others who try and failed is becos someone looked and saw the vision of hope in a film name,fantasy
i am not going to go into any spoilers or tell people to go see this movie i am sure if you are reading these review you are already going to go see the movie i also will not go into all the awesome things that went down at this early screening in century city like an unexpected visit by some major people who were lightly involved with the movienobody that contributed that muchjust joss whedon kevin feige chris hemsworth and loki himself tom hiddleston but who cares about that oh waiteverybody thereok so now for the reviewi believe this movie is everything it is hyped up to be i am not going to go into all the things i could praise about this movie because there are so many things and it would take awhile however i will state the two things that i have a minor problem with and should be the only complaints about this movie 1 joss whedon said that he cut the original movie down from 3 hours down to 2 hours and 15 minutes this is something you will definitely notice if you pay enough attention this leaves room for some out of place scenes and some fully unexplained situations but i am guessing it was the studios decision to do this so dont blame joss because he did a great job with this enormous task 2 the reason why this film might gain less critical acclamation then dark knight rises or any other comic book movie is because of the huge load of characters that this movie has to balance i am not saying they are not handled perfectly but it is still much different then a movie with one central hero all of these main heroes have had their own movies you will need to remember this in order to properly weigh how joss whedon handled all of them together overall i think almost anybody will thoroughly enjoy this movie whether you just like action movies or whether you sit around waiting for new news to come out i am a big marvel fan and i was very speculative about this movie on whether it would be a worthy representation of the and it completely delivers support this movie so that we can have more and more like it,fantasy
lots of money lots of cgi highpowered cast halfassed story that about sums up the latest joss whedon extravaganzaspoilers the story clunky it doesnt flow easily joss whedons script is okay and even hints at deeper themes but is ultimately a bit tacky and shallow some welcome laughs here and there but pretty average scriptingimdb at time of writing has it at 86 86 not even close flat 7 at best im giving it 5 because for all that money and there was a hell of a lot of it its a pretty poor effortbig time films seem to be in a trend of having convoluted stories rather than great storytelling and the follows that trend the whole causing dissension among the ranks fails significantly because it relies on the superheroes forgetting all the struggles  personal growth theyve been through in previous films the tries to present them as reluctant and egotistical which of course they luckily overcome but theyve already been through things like this in their own films why have they regressed perhaps the reason is that hollywood largely eschews the timetested concept of character growth for flashy sfx that the kiddies like so much its sad and results in hollow films like the for examplethe cgi pretty good but has flying worms ala the latest transformers flick but not as coolthe cast not too bad scarlett johansson in a tight outfit and the usual cast of robert downey jnr chris evans etc etcoverall its got highwattage stars lots of cgi and not much impact tension or heartbetter than battleship as if that was hard not as good as iron man 1 enjoyable and immediately forgettable itll make loads of money and probably even a sequel,fantasy
dont know what people linked in the movie the action starts pretty late almost 1 hr into the film action sequences pretty common based in city streets as seen in a few other movies though little comedy by hulk makes action scenes bearable one other thing why would the army build by loki be of aliens thats funny right why will be the person claiming to be god have an army of powerless aliens with guns and spaceshipsthe first hour of the movie is a bit drag and feels like the director had to try real hard to put things together to make some sense which totally did not and after that what the movie offers in the second hour is not all that great to have waited 1 hour to get to that,fantasy
first off there is no way this film is even close to a 9 rating its at 88 or something now no waythe people who are saying the film is a 9 are most likely hyper teenagers who sit home all day and dont read anything and watch reality tv  they dont know what is good and what is terriblethis film is dull has no emotion forced doesnt count and often times is ridiculous though what saves it is the fact it makes fun of itself which is funny normally i would rate really low but that humour makes it a little betterit was well done for what it is but i think what happened is the last few comic book movies except for batman were so bad that people were surprised with this one expecting it to suck so i read things like this is the greatest film ever or a rating you have to be jokingone of the things that really gets to me is one part in particular the hulk is this uncontrollable force he almost destroys the ship makes sensethen next thing you know he is fighting along with the umhello how the hell did that happen oh they magically tamed the beast or something banner says my secret is i always stay angry something like that and then turns into the hulk and starts fighting the aliens this makes no senseso if he had this mentality all along why did he want to kill everyone on the ship nothing was learned i mean he saves iron man later but on the ship he wanted to kill thor and others  huge gap anyone with half a brain would question this i enjoy watching this more in cartoon form because the ridiculousness makes sense,fantasy
better than other marvel movies with the possible exception of capt america it has the look down heroes we grew up with are on screen together it gets you stoked but the action felt rushed and the story is suspect however what is hard to figure out is how mr whedon could have made the film any better i think good is probably the best you can achieve when making such a film as the too many heroes not enough time to create a cohesive story and not enough time to care about whats going on so basically surrender and enjoy a good summer filmit would have been nice if it was 3 hours long then we could have enjoyed more story and possibly connected better with the characters as well as had better more complete action there is another huge issue i had with the film basically its an action flick so the action has to be tip top but i think the action could have been much better thor v iron man definitely should have been longer thor v hulk should have been more of an isolated knock down drag out fight the heroes should have displayed their might more instead we got good looking scuffles that kinda felt out of place and cut short in most cases the ending sums up how the action fell just a bit short hulk taking out loki in the comics that would not have been easy loki is a magical demigod no way could loki have been easily approached and whipped like that but it felt like whedon needed to get the movie over with quickly and at the time i was ready for it to endcharacter development fell short in a couple of cases when hawkeye was compromised it was like so what the aliens loki used were an unexplained bunch the chitaru felt like darth vadars pawns from star wars there was no way you felt like the chitaru were a threat at all the chitaru were there to be killed until the heroes were able to take loki down i mean if i were a demigod would i show up with the chitaru i think notthe best thing about the movie is the fact the movie finally made it to the big screen i have waited 35 years for this i was an avid comic book collector as a kid and the was always the comic book my friends and i wanted to see come true so i truly enjoyed the visuals so here it is finally on the big screen enjoy it but dont expect depth and emotional connection to the characters like the dark knight franchise which by the way is a much better franchise 710,fantasy
the plot is very bad and very predictable this is just a regular comic book movie with a great action scenes and cgi but the story messed it all loki as the main villain is very bad he didnt look as great as heath ledgers joker from the dark knight the kinda focused only on iron man it should be called iron man and friends hawkeye and black widow need a bigger role the hulk pants doesnt really logical isnt it joss whedon screw this movie it doesnt come up to my expectations even though everybody calling it a very good movie captain america and thor fight should be won easily by thor it doesnt really make sense how cap could be evenly strong as thor the ending is bad too are you serious right now joss whedon waking iron man up with a scream from the hulk,fantasy
why did they float around in the sky for hours waste of fg fuel what was wrong with the boat in the first place what did that hot bh and that guy with the bow and arrow even do peppaz wasnt even in it the special effects were bullst and there werent enough explosions why did that guy turn green what happened to edward norton wasnt that green guy in mexico how did he get to new york in under 2 hours why did the aliens only send 1 alien bh at a time they clearly had 3 to deploy this film was fn wk i would rather circumcise myself than watch it again its stupid iron man died xx,fantasy
i am guessing that the star power blinded everyone who rated this movie 10 or maybe i am not fan boy enough but i just dont understand this movie was akin to the other companys movie daredevil while i actually didnt mind dd it was pretty darn awful this movie weaves together several setup movies into a culmination of bad one lines and strange story plots the forced conversations to build up relationships it just terrible i dont want to put spoilers on as i know people are want to see this it has the potential to be a good movie but it just isnt there is a visual splendor to this movie if you forget that the story is strange and incongruent it a little too long for the climax the first time they are all in the room is like watching chaosokay to wrap up it has entertainment value if you ignore the flaws so i didand gave it a passable 510,fantasy
i certainly have an affection for the marvel universe and some of the vast catalogue of recent films have been decent efforts this one is certainly a decent effort but its not the thrill ride you would expect from such a stellar line upthe plot is basically evil god tries to take over the worldand would have come close if it hadnt been for those meddlin heroesyadda yadda well you get the ideacast there are some great actors in this movie who do a decent job with what they have to work with iron man thor  hulk especially are the real backbone for me there are some miscasts here are well black widow loki  the almost instantly forgettable hawkeye sj as widow just doesnt fit for me shes a great actress but not really an action hero the dialogue is poor and she doesnt seem to know what attitude the character should portray th as loki he just doesnt seem to have been written a great part but theres something not mischievous enough about his portrayal he neither hams it up or puts any sort of humour into the partjr as hawkeye has no screen presence or can manage any sort of chemistry with sj when they are attempting to give some sort of validity to their respective part in this tale its all very wooden that mainly comes from the limp script theyre both given instantly forgettableone mention should go to samuel jackson  dude looks as bored doing this as he did doing star wars surely hes rich and famous enough to go back to decent acting jobs such as long kiss goodnight plot too many threads makes this a long film although it doesnt drag on the setup seems to be mainly a precursor to getting the hulk into the action its very wordy but its not too much inbetween huge bouts of actionscript pseudo bs as all these movies are theres a smattering of humour really only from stark but in the main its bearable there are character weaknesses like ive said above but it aint the script you came for and this isnt shakespeareactioneffects my god this looks great even the 3d is pretty effective there are some dull action scenes particularly the fight between thor and iron manzzzz but in the main its decently directed one point of note though some of the 3d shots are so out of place its laughable towards the end theres a shot through a cab rear window and it completely stops any flow the movie had for a second or two bizarre there are more but that one just struck me out of the bluesummary not the best marvel film and certainly not on par with other comic book films such as xmen first class nolans batmandark knight or raimies initial spiderman reboot but its certainly better than captain america and green lantern the latter being one of the worst films i think ive ever paid to see,fantasy
when this movie first came out i was somewhat excited i hadnt seen ratings like that very often 88 right off the bat and i was fairly new to imdb at the time too unfortunately it really wasnt anything special the plot itself is pretty lackluster its just an average action movie in terms of story sure theres nothing really wrong with that but nevertheless it wasnt very welldonethe characters are just the same as the plot nothing special sure we get lots of looks at how well they fight as well as a little bit of arguing but thats about it the character development wasnt amazing in this movie sure they had the other marvel movies to develop the characters separately but thats hardly an excuse not to put effort into this movie the action which is the only thing the contains is all just fine everyones just extremely overpowered human or not to an unrealistic level overdone fights arent really my thing considering how commonly we see them overall the is nothing special sure it was risky for joss whedon to put all the marvel characters into one universe and he actually pulled it off but giving points to this movie for that is like giving it points for its creation the character and plot were very average and the action was rather unamusing the is heavily overrated in my opinion and i personally wouldnt recommend it,fantasy
im not really into superheroes movies however i really enjoyed batman trilogy of nolan nor into comics but people around me were talking so much about how cool the was that i decided to buy the blu ray 3d and give it a try and it was a big disappointment  ok its entertaining its a blockbuster with a lot of budget and special effect and action but the story is casual and predictable same thing for the characters  i really dont get how people could have been so excited for something like thatthe worst part  if a movie so casual has that much success the directors of the sequels wont make any effort to make a better work on the story the second movie did confirms that it was even worse but apparently a lot of cuts where made because it was too long otherwise maybe the dvdbr version will be a little betterof course not all the marvel movies are like that fortunately  im open minded and i love cinema so i did try some other stuff the marvel studios made so i can highly recommend guardians of the galaxy i loved it and the ant man that was nice too the other marvel movies  well let just say that if you dont watch them you dont miss a lot,fantasy
this movie revolutionized the way we imagine comic book movies dc have a big competition although the second one was better this movie this was the original which in a way means this is better the villain in this film is of course loki who was played by tom hiddleston who was outstanding but talking of amazing performances rdj was as usual a perfect ironman the directing of joss whedon was well there are no words he is a virtual god walking among mere mortals to sum up great movie great acting and great directing its definitely no wonder how it grossed to over 15billion by roman torr who is without doubt the biggest marvel fan ever,fantasy
tying all of the various marvel movie threads together is a tall order and the does a pretty fine job of that chief among the movies strengths is that everyone who headlined their own movies gets some time in the sun and thats    well thats just impressive and despite the dull nyc big finale there was some exciting summer spectacle herein mostly in the fight scenes but my favorite parts were during the quieter moments when all the noise and cgi were dialed down the movie works best when its a bunch of competing heroes thrown together in a room when the egos and styles clash whedons rhythms and sense of humor blossombut it does its job admirably and lends itself to serious popcornmunching710,fantasy
first off there is never a dull moment in this movie something interesting is always happening it is the perfect blend action and comedy every character is perfectly cast and does an outstanding job would recommend everyone sees this film before they die by far one of my favorite movies i have seen this movie multiple times and it has me on the edge of my seat every time i love every single marvel movie and cannot wait to see what they do with not only the but also each individual superheros independent film franchise every actor is perfect for their role which makes it hard to choose a favorite fantastic movie,fantasy
when the first came out in may of 2012 i passed it up figuring that it would be just another boring superhero movie but when i sat down to watch this film it completely amazed me with its fantastic special effects witty dialog awesome action scenes and great performancesthe film opens with a cool shot of the tesseract and a chilling voice saying that the cube has awoken and the time is ripe to invade the earth with loki leading the chitauri in an attack and only the can stop him from conquering the planet but at the same time the team must learn to work together despite their differencesnow i never read any comic books before i saw this film but it is definitely a dream come true seeing iron man thor black widow the hulk hawkeye and captain america come together to save the world is something that we wanted to see ever since it was first teased in iron man back in 08 this is clearly a movie made for fans of marvel and joss whedon does such a great job with respecting the source material handling all these egotistical superheroes with different personalities and giving them all an equal amount of screen time while making all the fans happy with this film and so far the only other comic book movie directors who have been able to pull that off are bryan singer and matthew vaughn with the xmen filmsthe way the characters interact and play off one another is done perfectly here and while there isnt a lot of character growth in the as that was what the setup films were for joss does a wonderful job making the interactions between the lead characters feel more real you might think that with so much going on that the movie would collapse under its humongous expectations but thanks to whedons directing and writing the film works wonderfully the dialog had me laughing my ass off more then a few times while i was watching the film the acting couldnt be better with each actor bringing their acting chops to the table and putting it to good usei honesty cant see anyone else play tony starkiron man other than robert downey jr he slips into the role so easily allowing his charm and appeal to shire through and he has some of the best lines in the film chris evans hardens himself in this film as capitan americasteve rogers and truly owns the role in this film bringing a great deal of heart and genuineness to the role and the dialog between him and stark teases later events in the mcu chris hemsworth once again rocks it as thor by being more honorable and less conceited not to mention having quite a few funny moments throughout the film scarlett johansson is great as black window and proves that she is more than just a pretty face and kicks some serious ass during the battle scenes the one character that didnt get enough screen time was jeremy renners hawkeye but thankfully he isnt chucked aside and does a splendid job playing this character hawkeye is right up there with legolas and robin hood as one of the best archers to ever adorn the movie screen being the most current actor to play the hulk mark ruffalo does a great job playing both the angry green giant and the nerdy bruce banner with incredible ease and while i do prefer edward norton as the hulk mark is a fine replacement and during the film the hulk is at his most imposing in the final battle and the scene where he smashes loki into the floor is just awesome samuel l jackson gets to stretch his legs a bit as nick fury in this film and he glides easily into the role clark gregg returns as agent coulson cobie smulders adds a nice touch as agent maria hill and stellen skarsgard pops up again as dr eric selvig as does gwyneth paltrow as pepper pots but tom hiddleson is the true star of this movie as thors villainous halfbrother loki and one would think that a role like this would be difficult to play dealing with all of these strong personalities and overwhelming individuals but tom nails it and his performance shouldnt be ignored because its one of the movies strong points and hiddleston comes across as a scheming megalomaniac but without being cartoonish or over the top and he steals the movie every time hes on screen but tom also handles the comedy incredibly well with his exchange with robert downey jr being extremely funnywith a run time of just over 2 hours the film has a great pace and never once did i get bored while i was watching it the special effects are state of the art the musical score by alan silvesteri works very well and the action is some of the best ive ever seen in any movie no body feels cheated when it comes to the battle scenes and the final battle in new york is right up there with the battle of helms deep and the assault on the death starr as one of the best onscreen battles ever and the climax delivers an earsplitting level of action that is breathtaking and awesome to behold also be sure to stick around for an end credits scene which provides a nice little set up for future marvel filmsi went into this movie with pretty high expectations and all of them were met while this movie isnt the best superhero film in my opinion there is no doubt in my mind that the is a purely awesome film it should be watched by any comic book film fan so go give it a watch if you havent already youll enjoy it,fantasy
a truly fantastic movie and the first of its kind marvel did a terrific job way to go making so many superhero movies and connecting all to each other is a hell of a job when it all started with iron man 2008 no one could imagine that the franchise would grow this big all because of marvel we were able to enjoy this movie only months remaining for age of ultron to come and im sure that will surpass this movie too tom hiddleston did a great job in the movie as loki robert downey jr was always great as usual and along with him every other actor namely chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo jeremy renner scarlett johansson and samuel jackson special mention cobie smulders and clark gregg,fantasy
hands down best superhero movie till date it had the right mix of story and action sequences the movie spends the first half of its time in building the story although marvel had already laid some foundation for this story in its previous movies tesseract was seen in captain america the first avenger the second half of the movie is where you get to see all the action hulk smashing the giant flying robot hulk smashing loki and hulk saving iron man geez it seems like hulk was really enjoying himself out there well coming back to the story so shield was trying to harness tesseract energy and thus it fell on the radar of the lokior we should say thanos now loki had made this deal with thanos that he will deliver tesseract to him if he helps him in conquering earth so loki arrives on earth steals the tesseract from shield and uses it to create a portal and call an army now its up to our superheroes to stop loki and save earth the movie is packed with pretty badass fighting scenes you get to see the battle between thor and iron man you also get to see thor using his hammer on captain americas shield and of course then there is the battle between and lokis army coming to characters i think movie mostly revolves around iron man loki and hulk captain america seemed useless in this movie hope they use him in a better way in next loki is clearly one of the wittiest characters in the marvel universe no wonder why people love him all in all its a true entertainer and like i said the best superhero movie till date if you havent watched this movie then dont wait any longer just watch it and see hulk smash,fantasy
this movie just did not do it for me the movie was a box office hit it made 623279547 in the united states alone and is third on the list of top grossing films of all time however a movies earnings do not suggest it was a great film obviously the concept was a hit comic book superheroes converging to save earth and fight interstellar enemies i just think the movie was flat though i myself am not a comic book enthusiast so i do not personally care for superheroes and the sort but the movie itself just seemed so bland the characters actions seemed forced and there was just too much action for the movie to have any sort of depth of course there had to be action since they are superheroes but i just felt like so much more could have been done with the film i did not think the actors did very well either i think it was just the film though most of them are great actors crossovers and ensemble character films usually do not do well and this film is a prime example it was bland predictable and lacking in many fields such as character depth and plot maybe it is just my own aversion to comic book films specifically marvel ones i did not even like guardians shoot me now but i think many would agree with me in saying this summer blockbuster was severely underwhelming there was nothing incredible mighty or iron about it,fantasy
i rarely go to the theater to see a movie but this one had me going twice and ive watched it another few times on netflix it is exactly what a superhero movie should be exciting fun and funny yes there are plot holes contradictions and absurdities in this movie i couldnt even list them all without turning this review into a novel full of spoilers but the bottom line for this and any movie in this genre is did you enjoy it and i enjoyed the hell out of it if youre the type who goes to a movie to nitpick about every aspect that requires a suspension of disbelief then youll hate this movie and you are to be pitied because youll hate just about every movie the rest of us will be so entertained that well have a blast while we watch it and then laugh about the silliness afterward,fantasy
never saw it in the movie theater but i had heard that it was great and awesome after some time it finally hit dvd so i rented it and i was completely disappointed there was nothing amazing about it the acting was okay the story was meh and the villain which in my opinion is a big part of a super hero film was just awful people dont know about movies now a days the fact that the quote best super hero move of all time is printed on the dvd cover really makes me doubt the film industry today if this mess of a movie can make over a billion dollars at the box office and masterpieces cant even get 100 millions is disheartening hands down the most over rated movie of all time its bland its clich and i dont understand how people can eat this crap up,fantasy
way back in 2008 marvel decided to make a movie version of one of their lesser known comic book characters iron man of course we are now familiar with the character and the success marvel have enjoyed but it was a bit of a risky move for them what was even riskier was the idea that they would follow up with a number of origin movies for their other superheroes before throwing them all into one huge summer blockbusterit seemed destined to fail such was its ambition and yet somehow they have pulled it off assemble is not the best comic book movie ever made but it is probably the most fun marvels biggest coup was hiring joss whedon to write and direct the movie whedon who had already written a number of comic books before being asked to take on is extremely comfortable with all of the characters giving almost everyone a fair share of the runtime one of the best things about assemble is the dialogue it is quite a feat to make a movie about a group of superheroes saving the world and yet some of the best scenes are just two people talking that is not to say there isnt some mind blowing action with some of our childhood favourites slugging it out against each other before uniting against a common enemy but it is often the verbal sparring which will have you grinning the widestthe cast are all on top form with downey jr being the star attraction but the best character in the whole movie is not human and perhaps not even a superhero mark ruffalos hulk is an incredible feat especially when you consider the previous incarnations of the character and he is heavily involved in many of the movies best scenes possibly the most ambitious project to come out of hollywood since four hobbits set off to destroy a magical ring assemble is a resounding success ticking all the right boxes and leaving you wanting more,fantasy
i will start out by saying that overall i did enjoy this film i feel like the rating system here on imdb is used so incorrectly by the majority of folks who use it for example if someone loved this movie they give it a 10 if they didnt like it they give it a 1 where the truth actually lies somewhere in the middle everything is not black and white in movies and i feel like this movie is an unfortunate byproduct of that misconception with a star studded cast and some pretty incredible visuals the does many things well that a superhero movie should what this movie doesnt do well is deliver a unique gosh thats the best superhero movie ive ever seen experience despite what the inflated rating would tell you the plot of the features a pretty basic premise the us government naive to their own research on a mysterious object called the tesseract accidentally opens a rift to another world allowing the norse god loki to enter earth and essentially wreak havoc this of course leads to the formation of the which is a collection of marvel superheroes that many of you will recognize either from the comic books or previous marvel films together under the initiative these superheroes go to battle with loki over the sacred tesseract which when wielded by loki can open a rift to another dimension and potentially end the world as we know it sound familiar it should as this general pretense has been used many times over in the past while the plot doesnt feature any large holes it also doesnt bring anything new or exciting to the table either you can expect many mini battles between loki and the heroes along the way ultimately leading to the final showdown of the film this is superhero movie 101 and while it works for all intensive purposes the hardly innovates the genre in any way based on its high rating i had expected a somewhat unique experience for a superhero movie but i was unfortunately let down in this regard the movie does pace itself quite well however which kept me interested throughout if there is one thing the does very well its keeping the viewer interested without any serious lulls in the action next up is the actingcasting this movie is literally jam packed with famous actorsactresses from robert downey jr as the always recognizable iron manmy personal favorite from not just these films but all in the marvel collection chris evans as captain america mark ruffalo as the hulk and chris hemsworth returning as thormy second favorite of these characters there are many others from scarlett johansson to samuel l jackson to jeremy renner etc etc you get the idea there are lots of famous people in this movie the acting from these heavyweights of the industry is generally very good despite a pretty generic script you can expect a lot of cheesy oneliners petty arguments and general im a better superhero than you moments throughout the script with a lack of clever writing and in my honest opinion a truly despicable villainloki just doesnt do it for me sorry he looks like a 15 year old boy with a deer helmet the has a hard time distinguishing itself from the pack despite all the talented actors involved with this film one could really make the argument that the talented actors casted for this film are what makes the movie above average because they really have to make the most out of what they are given in the script overall the offers an exciting albeit predictable superhero experience the actors bring their agame for this film and the electricity between them definitely makes this movie better i do have to say i felt a bit of nostalgia watching some of my favorite heroes from childhood band together on the big screen to battle evil despite its fairly long runtime the kept me interested from start to finish even if i cringed at some of the writing from time to time overall though i think it was the villain loki who brought the viewing experience down for me he just isnt believable as a true villain and the twist at the end will leave you feeling pretty underwhelmed despite these fall backs though this is still an enjoyable film to watch if you expect something more than a 2 hour superhero romp coming into this you may find yourself a bit disappointed like i was if you come into this thinking that you will see some cool superhero action and some great actors you will be much better off the is a cool superhero movie but in my opinion nothing more this film isnt american beauty or even the dark knightbest superhero movie ever imo so as long as you temper your expectations you will more than likely enjoy the for an exciting if somewhat underwhelming superhero experience i give the a solid 610,fantasy
i shall start this review by mentioning the fact that the is one of the most overrated movies of all time its simply awful if you agree with the large fanbase of idiots who enjoyed this film listen carefully joss wheadon is an autistic oversized 5 year old who crammed his dreams and aspirations of being a superhero into a big budget eye pleasing blockbuster with less than mediocre acting and terrible green screen the storyline is so tedious i dont even care if its based on a popular comic series that i wouldnt be surprised if a 5 year old wrote this movie there is an incredible amount of bad acting which deserves to be in a junior school play displayed by chris hemsworth and tom huddlestone despite being the only credited actor i respect on this film now you may argue that robertdowney jr is an amazing actor but i disagree his ego flourishes as tony stark which displays his incapicity to act in various roles summary the is an extremely overrated film which is no where near on the level as christopher nolans the dark knight it contains poor script writing cheesy effects acting and directing i can already tell what marvels guardians of the galaxy is going to be like and i have no doubt that the eye candy and cheesy jokes will brainwash 90 of the general public to like it,fantasy
failing to fins a suitable villain the writers then patently failed to think of a decent story but they still had 2 hours and 20 minutes of movie to fill so what to do probably after several drinks and very late at night someone had a bright idea lets pit the against each other thatll fill at least 90 minutes of movieand so we get a lot of contrived situations where one avenger goes up against another of course you cant pit a puny human against a demigod or the hulk or iron man so the combinations are limited hawkeye versus the black widow thor versus iron man thor versus captain america and so onhaving exhausted all those possibilities we finally get to the main action against the baddies for a supposed invasion of earth we get to see a dozen troop carriers with about 1000 troops who proceed to randomly shoot at anything and everything cue nuclear blast and the story endsand there we are a film thats just one fight after another with characters making senseless decisions with indestructible heroes that defy the laws of physics and sfx that detract rather than add to the experienceand then there are the plot holes and there are dozens of them there are so many of them that it would take me 2 hours and 20 minutes just to list themif you want a film devoid of plot with action sequences you cant follow with a pitiful ending then the is the film for you,fantasy
sure the special effects are amazing if you remember the ff movies that are just a decade old they appear now totally outmoded if you compare with the transformers that are more recent sure the movie is better visualized it isnt a change of shoot each second its more focused about the characters and less on pure crazy action thus you can follow what happens sure the casting is experimented and it was cool to see that johnny storm has become steve rogers as the actor was really cool in the aforementioned ff movies sure it has some good lines about legolas a real understanding of those icons example hulk trying to move thors hammer original new mysteries who are the shadow people sure it adapts one of the best comics stories the super hero who turns bad and destroys a shielb base was millars enemy of the state and all this for only 4 yes because the first hour is totally boring i have even slept in this black night also because the screenwriter of super heroes lacks the talent of the comics writer stan the man who invented the could tell the same story in 22 pages it was fast easy to understand here the plot is unintelligible uses and abuses of scientific concepts and stupid name tesserac also because i have the feeling to have missed a movie what about the story about black widow and hawkeye also because the alien invasion is just destroy for destroy so the last hour is an astounding but hollow action scene in conclusion its finally better than daredevil but faraway of the classic raimis spiderman,fantasy
this is an ok superhero flick featuring the marvel comics heroes thor ironman the hulk captain america hawkeye and black widow they are assigned to protect the entire globe from loki the stepbrother of thor and an alien invasionthere are plenty of enjoyable action is this movie helped with some slapstick humor the action sequences especially during the climax were breathtaking and exciting leaving the audience thoroughly entertained however the movies main plot and story arent very captivating or compelling coupled with lack of chemistry and substance between the cast of charactersi would like to have seen every superhero in this movie given a more elaborative purpose and equal screen time it appeared that ironman was the main focus of the movie and took away most of the glory  too much emphasis was placed on the character robert downey jr was too cocky and tried too hard to be funny in the ironman roleoverall this movie is just one battle scene after the other not much of a story here but its something the kids would love to watchgrade c,fantasy
excelcior my fellow marvelites marvels the has finally arrived and i can safely and happily say that not only does it live up to the massive hype surrounding it but it actually surpasses it in the iron man the hulk hawkeye black widow thor and captain america all have to team up unwillingly i might add in order to stop loki and the alien spieces under his servitudethe chitari from taking over the earth i love this movies script for many reasons not the least of which is that it addresses what i was thinking wait i thought that these people always work alone how are they going to be able to suck up their pride and fight as a team well lets just say that when they first meet each other these heroes dont get along very well in fact it is more like a wwe smackdown since when they first meet they beat the crap out of each other the reason why this works so well is because of like i said if because of the script the dialouge is so clever funny wellwritten and overall good that it raises summer blockbuster standards for scriptwriting the fact that the awesome director joss whedon you might recognize him as was the writer for for buffy the vampire slayer toy story serenity firefly etc also wrote the script and that he is such a huge comic book fan and he has such an eye for detail that i find incredible there are so many easter eggs in this movie for marvel fans to discover like in captain americathe first avenger and they are all worth the hunt the fact that he has written so many scripts and some comic books and directed some tv episodes it makes sense for him to direct a movie with several different famous superheroes in one movie i also find it amazing how none of the heroes become the odd one out each of them do so many badass things that fans of each hero if they arent fans of all of them will be more than satisfied everybody in this movie does terrific triplea performances it is hard for me to pick out who i liked the best but if i had to choose id pick loki tom hiddleston and right behind him is bruce banner the hulk mark ruffalo the 3d is surprisingly well done while not avatar3d good it is still pretty damn good you are probably wondering well how was the action the answer really badass you can always tell what is going on during the many action scenes unlike some other action films out there coughtransformers 2cough and they are all so intense that you dont want them to end the is a truly amazing dazzaling and breathtaking film that i hold it even higher than the dark knight marvel has outdone themselves again and for films in general but they have also obliterated it it raises the bar for superhero movies it is truly a movie spectacle that must be seen by all dc films are going to have to step up their game now robert downey jr was right when he said that the was marvels finest hour i got one question though whats next marvel,fantasy
walking into the movie theatre i didnt expect very much im glad i didnt or i wouldve been disappointed the movie starts off slowly and from the get go everything about it seems for lack of a better word dull with the success of dc comics the dark knight the shoes for superhero flicks were large to fill marvels counterpart failed to deliver the same grandiose style riveting story and memorable performancesto start off with the story felt like a patchwork of scenes put together simply to bring earths mightiest heroes together for what would turn out to be a fortyfive minute transformersesque brawl some people may say that sounds awesome why are you complaining if you said that this movie is for you if you want a little more than hulk smash look somewhere elseto joss whedons credit he saw that he had a potential home run and did everything possible not to screw it up if his goal was to make as much money as possible he was extremely successful however because of this playing it safe philosophy the movie relies far too heavily on unexplained coincidences in the plot character backgrounds found in previous marvel flicks and also without giving away any spoilers blatantly ripping off the ending to a certain star wars movie that was panned by critics the is a decent popcorn flick that killed at the box office however it does not transcend the superhero genre to become a truly great film,fantasy
marvel needs no introduction those who grew up in 70s 80s and 90s read and watched comics and cartoons produced by marvel and those whose childhood belongs to 2000 must have watched some amazing movies produced by them it is simply close to impossible to create a master piece again and again this is the reason why most of the sequels flop at the box office but i simply dont know what formula lies with marvel from hulk 2003 to the 2012 they continue to provide the best of experience to their audiences including iron man 200810 thor 2011 and captain america 2011 they are definitely the entertainersit was not a piece of cake to get all the superheroes together in any movie just like that after all screen play plot logic and script have to be extraordinary for making them stand shoulder to shoulder marvel studios and paramount pictures bang on the perfect script in which they united the amazing team of superheroes as well as they grab the right cast the story revolves around how the director of shield nick fury performed by samuel l jackson gathers a team of all super heroes including iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth and hulk mark ruffalo along with black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to fight against loki tom hiddleston who plays thors fathers adopted son and threats nick fury to demolish the peace on earth and rule it as loki just like thor is not a human and possesses super natural powers and army there has to be super heroes against this god of evilsthe movie brings surprises in many ways the interaction between all the characters whether in their super heroic attires or common suits is firstrate the dialogues between tony stark and captain america gives you many reason to smile and clap at many places off the record i managed to whistle as well the action sequences of hulk were worth watching again and again just to note the expressions and daredevil stunts thors entry is a treat to watch and the complete scene is remarkable how thor the god of thunder iron man and captain america try to show their strengths  simply bravura samuel l jackson gets a much lengthy role this time unlike iron man 2s role and he simply proves his excellence with his performance be it the beginning of the movie communiqu with loki and post interval same goes for scarlett johansson she is fast and a nice element included in the movie  it is a difficult task to get noticed as a normal human in the movie studded by superheroes this time hulk is much civilized well you may say that he knows how to control his rage and mark ruffalo perfectly portrays a role am sure audience will love him over the previous hulks the only character from the who underperforms i am not saying that he has not performed well is hawkeye in such movies where there are so many heroes it is really difficult for the villain to stand out but tom hiddleston as loki excels and performs a role that is tailormade for him he looks comfortable and cold blooded both at the same time like all the scenes and sequences the climax is also directed very well by joss whedon characterization is strong script is clapworthy and there are many other surprises action wise it is undoubtedly a super movie brought to its audience by a team of super heroes called the watch this movie in cinema it is worth experiencing,fantasy
i want my noprize how did harry dean stanton know to wait for hulk to shrink back down to pants size but then ask is hes an alien i liked the council of elrond scene where the influence of the one ring i mean lokis staff causes strife among the and when bugs i mean thor steps out of the falling elevator just before it crashes i did not like the way the darkworld warriors all collapsed when the portal closed like in independence day same illogic as in oblivion look folks in independence day the alien fighters drew their power from the mother ship dont copy stuff you dont understand and dont copy dcstuff like the every cell phones a tracking device from the dark knight you can do better black widow is more deceptive thank loki nice is that thanos at the end apocalips the skrull king i know ive seen that mug before not really better than the spiderman or ironman movies but a tad better than the captain america hulk or thor solo films,fantasy
first of all this is a good film i watched it twice but it doesnt really make me think its a good film i watched it for the second time because i totally forgot how the movie was after a few monthsmany of my friends who have always been marvel fans insists its an awesome film yeah of course this movie has all the superheroes you worshiped in it but you know what because they are all together i couldnt really see the performance of each single heroas a conclusion its neither a bad movie or a great one its kind of at the 67 range if youre a loyal fan you may probably like it pure actions not much drama just watch em fight,fantasy
there was a lot of hype and build up leading up to this movie for the past few years and it has finally come and i will say it has lived up to its hypethis movie deals with thors brother loki trying to take over the earth by harnessing the tesseract an energy source with immense power nick fury then assembles iron man bruce banner captain america thor black widow and hawkeye to stop himthe movie starts out a little slow and the plot is very simple bad guy wants to take over the world and will do nothing to stop until he does its clichd but still pays off because of the amount of action the violence itself is cartoon like so it is safe for all agesone other issue i had was the hulk only has two appearances in this movie but in each he is the best hero to watch and definitely makes this movie awesome mark ruffalo also has given the best performance as bruce banner yet seen in movies he has far surpasses eric bana and edward nortonjoss whedon understood this movie is about giving audiences what they want to see with lots of marvel superheros in one movie thrilling action sequences humor and pure entertainmentthis isnt a perfect movie but it is still a lot of fun to watch and even if your not a comic book fan you will still like this film definitely give this a watch,fantasy
nick fury samuel l jackson of shield brings together a team of super humans to form the to help save the earth from loki and his armyi want to first address the imdb rating on this film currently it sits at an 83 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time now no matter how good you think it is does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made i mean really i grew up reading comic books so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others i think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base which is good because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed if you do not know who hawkeye is for example it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrowsmy biggest concern was how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities particularly the hulk who is not a team player this was addressed,fantasy
this was one of those movies i did not feel an urge to watch i waited until it was shown in the television i think one will find the movie more enjoyable if one has read some of the comics or know more about the marvel universe than i i frankly thought it a bit boring very nicely made and worth watching but i have seen better and the only reason it deserves to be on the top 250 is because of the effects but even if the effects are very well made i suppose it also helps make the movie less interesting just a lot of fighting and flying it is also as if this movie is not allowed to be serious always the serious scenes are broken by comedy sometimes bad humour that said it is still worth watching and it has good scenes and is pretty to watch but not one i am eager to watch anytime soon again,fantasy
i have seen the 3 times now and ever since the first time i watched the movie i felt that even though it was enjoyable there was something about the movie that just kept it from being a masterpiece to mefirst i will point out the good things about this movie the characters are very dynamic and well developed and some of the best conflict in the movie is between the heros rather than the villain another thing is that this movie has well done humor that doesnt seem out of placenow onto my issues with the movie of which there are 3 and ill start with the smaller ones first off no spiderman which is kind of ridiculous because spiderman is one of the main but that is forgivable the second issue is the fact that they never give a good explanation for why bruce banner can all of the sudden control his powers finally here is the big issue with the movie there is no moment in the movie where the heros are actually in trouble by that i mean no matter how bad things got there was never a huge struggle and the heros had everything under control in fact the final battle was far too easy they were facing an entire alien army for goodness sake but they never seemed overwhelmedoverall a pretty good super hero movie but falls short of the higher realm of superhero movies like the dark knight iron man spiderman 2 and watchmen,fantasy
its my first review here the reason why i dont review movies here is simple its because english is not my first language but i found the score to be so ridiculous that i decided to make my first review the is not the first overrated or underrated movie here but usually such overreaction about a movie last for 2 weeks or 1 month after the fans saw and reviewed it the score adjust itself when the people not sold to the movie start to see it but in the case of the it seems that theres so much people who gave the a not deserved 10 that to this day even after the disc release the score is still way too high 84  more than scarface and only 02 point away from apocalyspe now you got to be kidding me right  but enough with my imdb criticism heres my review of the moviepersonally i try to review movie with an open mind and rate a movie for what it is and what it tries to be if a movie features some of the best special effects or action sequences ever im gonna consider it in my review but what actually makes a good movie  directing acting casting special effects soundtrack costume script editing makeup cinematography  soul  personally i dont think a great movie needs to masterize all those few movies actually did shawshank redemption was really close but i think a great movie needs to be at the very least top in at the minimum 2 or 3 categories so lets see for the lets start with the script honestly its one of the worst script ive seen on the last 10 years it makes tron legacy script looks like a chefdoeuvre the directing  this is where the shine a little bit and its the only place it does its a miracle joss was able to make something good out of this awful script the acting was not bad but it was uneven tom hiddleston did a good job as lokki fassbender would have been better downey was good as usual but sorta under the autopilot ruffalo was okay but did not play a big role renner and johansson did the best they could with uninteresting characters but they were certainly not able to outdo themselves to make those characters interesting evans was awful as usual i cant stand this guy hemsworth was not really credible as a semigod but cant really blame him when a semigod gets owned by a modern day mr hyde overall the acting was galaxies away from fifth element i have a lot of respect for most of the actors in the who is to blame for the not exceptional acting  the script  the directing  the casting  lack of interest in the project by the actors  maybe a little bit of all of thosenow lets get to the name of the game which is the action sequences and the special effects and this is where i disagree with people giving this moving more than 7 while the special effects were technically great those were very far from being in the top league tron legacy had far more interesting special effects and tron legacy did not succeed avatar was leagues over the avatar is major league the is a farm club inception too even if i did not like it as much as i wanted to the special effects dont have a soul they are artistically nothing to write home about i already forgot them when i got out of the theater after seeing avatar 3d i felt like when i was young and saw terminator 2 for this first time i felt something i had not felt in years i was impressed by the special effects alone everything else was not important the special effects are meh its like a 10 years old kid designed them and they spent millions over millions to make them technically look good now lets get to the action sequences hero is league over that the firth element is league over that terminator 2 is league over that the matrix is a god creation when it comes to action sequences if you compare it to the now im not saying the special effects and action sequences were bad cause they were good what im saying is its not worthy of a 8 9 or 10 and not even close to it when you consider the script and uneven acting the special effects and actions sequences were certainly not good enough to make this movie great theres hundred and probably even thousand of movies with better special effects and action sequences when you compare them to the movies released at the same timenow when i started this review i intended to give the a 1 star but doing so would make me as bad as the people who gave this movie a 10 so a decided to give it the score it deserves which is imo a 69 now personally i think that imdb should think about the way it calculates the weighted average 10 and 1 rating weight way too much lets be honest for a second we have enough fingers to count the number of movies worthy of a 10 or 1 im astonished to see that close to 40 of the people gave the a 10 i really dont see how someone could think this movie is perfect even a fan of marvel the script alone is enough reason to reduce the score i dont mind short movies with no script when they embrace it but sadly the was close to 2 hours and a half and actually tried to tell a story and this is where imo the movie actually failed,fantasy
the was a fantastic movie bringing all the marvel movies together seamlessly this is what i may have said if id ever seen or read anything marvel in my life now i realize this isnt the movie or producers fault im just speaking for myself who happens to be utterly ignorant and oblivious to the world of comics in general to start out the movie i was happily surprised to think i was following the movie without any background knowledge suddenly i came to the realization that i was mistaken being thrown into some sort of futuristic space ship setting i was continuously introduced to new characters that didnt have character development as i was expected to be read up on that information before hand the importance of the characters and their role in the movie tended to be a roller coaster ride at the beginning scarlett johansson grabbed my attention and stole the movie with everything she had to offer to the action side of the movie she even took on 3 men without a blink somewhere along the line she ends up standing in the shadows without much to offer until the ending scenes chris hemsworths role in the film seems lost to me as well the back and forth between helping loci and wanting to take him down seems almost as if hes lost on which side to take this was distracting to me as a whole the characters were interesting however didnt exactly connect the story well by the middle of the movie it dawned on me that it was becoming more and more predictable from what ive gathered no super hero movie has ended in the super heros loss loci shows no sign of changing his ways from evil thus the outcome become inevitable no matter what loci throws the way from that point on every conversation of confusion between the characters and talk of what the next step will be to take seems pointless the wondering and guessing games could have been done without as far as im concerned the ending of the movie seemed to be too far fetched and far too drawn out to be enjoyable plausibly they all shouldve died before the hulk came around the way the creatures were destroying buildings it was hard to accept the fact that even with super powers they were destroying them one by one the setting of this battle was also a little out of reach showing everyone walk away unharmed and guarded by the nypd is beyond realistic given what the other creatures were capable of none of the pedestrians seemed to even be worried about the danger in the aftermath only thankfulness and gratitude for those who saved them is that how it would really happen i surely wouldnt think so as for the meaning and the plot line revolving around the tesseract i couldnt even being to explain that to someone the power it holds and the large question why it holds the power it holds still confuses me the knowledge needed for this movie before going into it seems to outweigh watching the film out of pleasure while i understood the concept of the movie and could still gather main points i believe that it reached out to more of the large marvel fans that have been following for years or decades this movie was slightly disappointing but what do i know im still asking the question avenger who,fantasy
this was by far one of the best marvel movies made to date the action acting and comedy laced in were on point through out the whole film the best part has to be when hulk did his smashing of loki and called him a puny god that stuff was super funny and entertaining i cant wait until the next and what it brings all the characters were super entertaining and im glad they were able to bring in a list actors to do the job do not go cheap on the 2nd one please thanos at the end was a great teaser so definitely looking forward to that i didnt mind mark being the hulk this time and he would be good to play the next movie as well it would be nice to see some guy play the hulk more than once and he does look the closest to the old bruce banners from the original tv series,fantasy
living in a world of more than 7 billion people one must consider this as a critical fact without trying to counterargue for any reason whatsoever the diversity in opinions can be unimaginably hugeand what is the reason for this what are the main variables that are to be held responsible for someones opinions well there is the environment we grow up  live in for two big ones with all their subcategories like the people that surround us and their beliefs of any kind if you grow up for example in a family that values honesty theyll probably push you into becoming an honest being if you grow up in a family that enjoys watching comedies in their free time youll probably grow a thing for comedies later on in your life  no matter how attracted you may become to other genres of movies a comedy will always be something you enjoy for various reasons the remembrance of your happy family moments for onelets say youre a fan of scifi movies you most likely grew up watching such and youve definitely been taken your breath away by certain classics as we call them nowadays that left you with some kind of a mental mark about how awesome they were alien for instance a totally breathtaking horror film a masterpiece for its kind its era so to my point it is wrong to compare any new film to the one that let you breathless i mean feel free to judge that what you just watched is better or worse but you cant direct a whole review to why a movie rocked your world or totaly sucked based on your mental mark about your favorite movie and its perfect to you characteristics specifications  moments of course there are reasons and places to do so if for example there is an award to be given between two or more but nothing more or lessi did enjoy the i did enjoy the cast i believe that robert downey jr acts in a very stylish awesome for me way that i might have enjoyed the movie only because i like him as iron man mark ruffalo and christ hemsworth are very amusing to watch as well their impersonations of the hulk and thor being incredibly amazing overally the cast fit their roles wellenough to create an enjoyable rocking atmosphere that will hold you tight in place until the very endthere were plenty of moments where i was slightly disappointed like the extreme damage and conditions that iron mans suit could sustain  the movie could have been better at certain points like these but the overall experience compensated hey its based on hardcore comic books after all and directors joss whedon great attention to its making is clearly noticeable if youve read the comicsthe movie was worth my time and i give it a seven out of ten ive seen a couple of better action scifi movies matter of personal preference and there always must be place for even better ones since human capabilities cant be imagined thus a seven from me to the makes this action scifi a mustsee to those that agree with me an outstanding production,fantasy
the film opens with a spectacular action sequence and you almost understand that the movie will be in epic scale that disappoints or does not thats another story lets talk about the team members first i know that i am in the minority and sorry but my favorite bruce banner was eric bana it is and it will be not edward norton in fact as an actor i like edward norton much more than eric bana but as a character bruce banner i think that norton didnt fit the character at all i mean that it was like i was watching edward norton not bruce banner it was not convincing for me as for mark ruffalo he was believable as banner so better than norton but worse than bana my only personal problem with hulk was i couldnt like this badass hulk i know that many of you will surprise when you read that but i really tried but i couldnt it is not important but also i would prefer my giant to be bigger and taller black widow is one sentence she is so hot period captain america was better in his own movie he is cold here i dont know he was unlikeable in this movie as action i cant say that his parts were bad but it was disappointing my favorite scene in the whole the first avenger movie was the shield fight and in this one there is not any scene in the same level for captain america and i didnt like this new costume either the conversation between him and the agent in the plane was realistic or poorly written you decide hawkeye is cool but before this movie honestly i didnt know about that character may be because of that i didnt feel any kind of excitement towards the character i just watched him the iron man is the iron man you know so thor is but there was a minor problem about iron man he was too powerful in this movie but really too powerful despite the parts take place in the helicarrier feels like star trek a little bit it was great great action the main villain of the movie loki has some problems as a character it reminded me magneto especially when he finds himself in a cocktail it was a pointless scene if you ask me and as a villain yes he is papertiger he cant be a dominating villain not because of the actor because of the script as for one for one fights whedon delivers he doesnt disappoint iron man vs thor fight was breathtaking hulk vs thor fight was great too dreams came true however the battle of words between iron man and captain america was insulting for me it was far fetched in general the team work works the very long final climax made the film despite at times it reminds you transformers as many people realized yes the cube the machines all these recalls transformers but there is the dream team different type of action a lot of creative ideas better direction better action you just forget it or you just dont care about it some people ask where is the military well i have two answers for that which relieve you i hope if the military had engaged the enemy the movie would have been just the copy of transformers movies and the movie would have been clich and boring there were not swat also that would make the movie clich and boring too if you ask me only the and the enemy think like that as said before i enjoyed but didnt like hulk in this movie as i seen most of the audiences loved the the punch and the slamming moments even some people said these were the best moments of the whole film sorry but i disagree it was just too funny for my taste i mean those moments ruined the tone of the film for me also that fight could have been a serious one but no problem it is like i liked this badass hulk but also i didnt like another thing i disliked about hulk was he was moving like a monkey at times and that annoyed me the action the oneliners everything else was great,fantasy
the is a movie that couldve gone wrong in a billion ways i didnt believe this could actually work even with whedon on charge i thought the balance between showing enough of every character handling our heroes with the credibility they deserve the whole story concepti thought it was almost impossible to handleand it probably is almost impossible to handle guess what joss whedon and the cast handled it they nailed it the is an excellent movieweve seen plenty of marvel movies that do something well something ok and something bad usually theres something lacking x2 for me was nearly the best marvel movie to date and i cant find significant flaws from it many marvel movies are mediocre and some of them downright suck fantastic four beyond belief so the couldve gone wrong or been just ok i grew up with those comics imagining these characters in action it wasnt just action you really got into the personal drama as well it was part of my lifenow im a grown man and never before has my inner child cried this many happy tears let me tell you why in simply a great movie1 acting downey jr is very good sticking to his iron man role and yet having scenes that dont involve just cracking jokes mark ruffalo  i simply loved him as bannerhulk ive grown to like ruffalo more and more and he just nailed hulk what about the actors of thor and loki in the movie thor i didntquite like them somehow they do well no ones a liability im even satisfied with chris evans scarlett johansson is as beautiful as ever doesnt really do her best but she isnt your useless megan fox either everyone every actor did at least ok most of them good2 contrast and structure in there is plenty of humor and it isnt too forced even though you know the jokes arent that great you still laugh you buy it there are also a few sentimental scenes and they mostly succeed remember wolverine crying noooo in x3 and origins yes that sucked none of that crap here with when its serious its serious and you take it seriously when its funny its funny and just for the right reasons also the plot im not giving out any spoilers butyou know it isnt that great of a plot and you know it would be hard to make it work due to its scale you know what it works just fine somehow whedon is able to take something that seems stupid clichd out of placeand make it work its never that intelligent nor ingenious but it gives enough reasons for whats happening 3 handling the characters our heroes every single one of them gets plenty of screen time every single one of them has at least a couple of amazing action scenes and a bunch of excellent ones as well i cant stress this enough  you can see every one of them actually enough not kidding another thing  the characters are treated with respect whedon is a fanboy himself he wanted to do these characters justice he wanted to show and portray these heroes right he succeeded oh yes hulk too especially him youll love him justice is served none of the characters is an idiot everyone gets treated with respect4 action visuals my mouth was open for the last 30 minutes it literally was i was cheering i was pumped i was a child again the incredible action scenes visuals characters everything absolutely everything clicked when it mattered the most this is what happens when you give a capable fanboy a crapload of hollywood money you dont get sucky transformers sequels no you get quality you get your inner child the satisfaction heshe never got before from these movies you get thethis is almost a perfect marvel movie i seriously doubt there are many filmmakers who couldve nailed this so well x2 is still my favorite superhero movie but manthis is right up there with the bestexcuse me while i watch my bluray again and again,fantasy
you can sum up in one wordfun some of the worlds greatest comic book characters all together in one movie kicking ass to save us puny humanswho wouldnt want to see that and as great as it is to see the come together to save the world some of the most fun is had when they butt heads and pound on each other just like in the comics iron man vs thor thor vs hulk iron man vs captain americagreat stuffdirector joss whedon does a solid job showcasing all the without forcing too much story into one movie rounding out the individual superhero movies that have been leading up to this was no easy challenge from jon favereaus good iron man movies to the marginal captain america and the abysmal thor pic whedon molds the good and bad that he had to work with from the past stories and made an entertaining filmim not so sure i would crown the as the top comic book movie of all time which is currently still the dark knight in my mind but it was a blast seeing all the marvel characters finally uniting in the same movie i can only hope that all the movies this blockbuster season are this much funfor more quick reviews check out wwwfilmstallioncom,fantasy
the is the best movie i have ever seen my whole life without stan lee and jack kirby the would not have even been a thought without the comic books joss whedon would have never have had an idea of where to startthe starts out kind of slow but you get to know the characters better that way a lot of the movie had me on the edge of my seat with my joker smile the hulk transformations to me were like opening tons of gifts on christmas and jumping up and down for joy seeing the hulk smile made me laugh he has nice teeth the fights were all so incredible they made me so happy all three times i saw the movie the was so well written and the cast was perfect to me seeing thanos made me gasp in excitement thanos is one of those guys you look at and you say to yourself i know that dude is evil he is a major major bad guy in the marvel universeif you have not seen the yet what is wrong with you i hope you enjoy my reviewi did not want to give a lot away,fantasy
i am a huge fan of the previous marvel films such as thor captain america and my favourite of all iron man but this film took it to a whole new level there is nothing wrong about this film the casting is perfect the script is perfect the film is just perfection i went to see the film with my family and my mum isnt a huge fan of superhero films but after watching this film she wanted to rewatch the other marvel films as she loved this film so much which goes to show the brilliant cast director and writers have gone above and beyond to produce the perfect superhero films that even gets people who dont usual enjoy them into becoming a lover of the films one of my favourite things about the film is the tension between the heroes at first and the bonds they end up having at the end of the film iron man robert downey jr develops a great broromance with the hulk mark ruffalo hands down the best film i have seen in 2012 and best superhero film ever id love to see how they top this film as the expectations are running high this film is lacking nothing if you havent seen it then you need to watch this film asap,fantasy
dont misunderstand me i liked this movie but i just dont think it deserves to have 85so according to imdbs top 250 this movie is better than fellinis 8 12 stalker a clockwork orange raging bull kill bill and most of kurosawa movies the in my opinion is just an enjoyable movie actually one of the best superhero movies ever made after the dark knight trilogy of coursei think this movie is incredibly overrated and i really hate that people think is one of the best films ever made when its far away from that,fantasy
positives the movie looks awesome cgi is unobtrusive and the costumes look almost exactly like the comics traditional but well told superhero blockbuster story putting michael bay to absolute shame simply by focusing on the and not some lame characters no one cares about every superhero acts like they should except maybe hawkeye but hes the only one i dont know from comics rescued the hulk from the absolute pits of the last two movies made about him and mark ruffalo made him the best part of the whole movie by far a satisfying conclusion with a very surprising and exciting reveal after the creditsnegatives hawkeye doesnt leave much of an impression enemy baddies couldve been explained a little more than they were kind of predictable i guess my two cents yeah,fantasy
looks like another parallel universe version of the in the original comic hulk was on a rampage and they got together to stop him in this version they got together to stop lokiso truly all star cast assembled to make this much anticipated movie i like the fact that all the actors really look their part except nick fury he kept reminding me of all things the red skullits difficult to come up with an enemy thats big enough to warrant an assemble joss whedon was the first director to successfully direct the motion of the hulk hulk looked most realistic in this movie he also must have been a long time marvel comic fan because all the other characters best moves were captured in this moviei liked captain america in this movie lot more than the captain america movie i knew that he would shine much more in a contemporary surroundingslooking forward for part 2,fantasy
having seen all of the other marvel films that lead to this film and being a huge marvel fan i was very excited to see this movie i feel that this movie is very good and totally worth the waitloki comes to earth and uses the tesserect and his magical powers to try to take over mankind shield decides to put into action the plan and recruits bruce banner iron man and captain america to join black widow on a team of the best on the earth thor also joins with the team later as the planet is still under his protectionthis film has great flow to it it starts off with loki coming to earth and then goes into each member of the joining the team it really started strongly and i totally forgot about thor and then he joins the team too so a lot going on that i liked early which is important to a film like thisall of the members of the are very good robert downey jr is great once again as starkiron man chris evans does a good job as captain america but i think he was missing something tho hemsworth is amazing as thor again i like jeremy renner as hawkeye but i feel that something was missing from that character as well maybe its cause im a pretty big hawkeye fan i thought mark ruffalo was ok but i really liked the hulk and scarlett johansen is good and her behind is amazing as far as acton goes this may be one of the best films i have ever seen in that regard tons of great action scenes in this film that i cant do justice trying to speak about youll just have to take my word for itthe only real complaints i have are that loki and his army he uses to attack earth arent well explained i think loki is good but he just doesnt come across as a formidable villain in this film or one that people even fear i cant really say too much more about this without giving a lot awaygreat movie great action and characters highly recommended,fantasy
first of all i must admit that i am not much particularly a fan of superheroes in general but i have seen the movies leading up to this simply because they were available and i had the time and i had read up on the hype around this movie so i might as well give it a go as welland as a fairly nonsuperhero kind of guy well i must say that the was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie the story was for me at least rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal sure it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior moviesthe effects in the were top notch as to be expected from a movie of this caliber lots of really great effects and visuals however when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly i was ready to turn off the movie that was just silly but i decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scenehowever one thing did make me wonder with all the destruction in new york you didnt see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way that was just stupid especially with so many people living there in fact you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie which was sort of lameanother thing puzzled me when bruce banner turned into the hulk for the first time in the movie he was out of control smashing everything and everyone in sight but somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time that just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformationand as with the previous marvel movies with these characters they had some great performances to the movie i think that it was actually tom hiddleston who plays loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the mostthe was good entertainment even for an antisuperhero guy like myself great action lots of destruction and great special effects,fantasy
i havent given very many films nine captain america being the biggest let down on superhero movies coming out now days i was cautious to see this movie because it was a huge budget with lots of famous cast as captain america was but i had to see it as i did others i was surprised of the cast given all they can in this made this one of the best i have seen in 2012 but still i could not give 10 stars as i did with thor i loved all the actors and actresses in this movie but i felt as paltrow should have given a bigger role as she only given short scenes in this movie i love the hiddleston he is destined for more great movies maybe playing mephisto and sepritoth in a final fantasy movie a great actor most of all downey jr stood out because of hes great acting skills he become a guarantee bet on movies now days a household name lol reason i could not give 10 stars this film lost that 1 star in the cutting room film jumped in places some characters did not get screen time they should have such is hulk captain america nick furry and as i mentioned before paltrow other then that visually spectacular action movie should be seen on big screen 3d if it wont kill your eyes,fantasy
in terms of quality i would compare the to superman starring christopher reeve ie absolutely no hokeyness whatsoever the story was superb the writing crackled with energy and the acting was excellent i thought that that the pacing was magnificent  suspense actually increased as the story proceeded and the perils became more and dire and catastrophiceach actor and actress seemed to me to be utilized to the optimum not only in terms of their skills as characters but moreover in terms of their thespian skills i thought that the movie was a real tourdeforce a sort of howtoreallydo it beckoning sequels of similar high quality to follow i hopei was relieved and glad to see josh whedon make full use of liam hemsworth as thor something i thought was sadly lacking in hemsworths first venture in portraying the viking god mark ruffalo finally gave us the first truly satisfying hulk since lou ferrigno even scarlett johannsons black widow with ample opportunities to overact to ham it up utilized her minimalist skills to allow the audience to interface with the story in the final set pieces of the movie downey and others also played down what was roiling inside of the characters minds and hearts and souls allowing the audience once again to interact and participate  as opposed to being dictated to or oversold on the emotions for a fantasy and a superhero movie that is quite a feat not only does josh whedon deserve tremendous credit for that result but also jon favreau and stan lee  among others  the portrayal of loki was on a par with shakespeares iago a character who takes great glee in being purely evil,fantasy
joss whedon is a nerd treasure after having earned his geek street cred with some of the most iconic tv shows and characters around my favourite of his creations remains firefly an allaround extraordinary show at the same time my deep dislike for fox after the cancellation of said show also remains intact it was the popularity of the show and the loyalty of the fans which brought joss whedon back with his fond and well deserved closing act  to the firefly saga in the form of the excellent but oft overlooked serenity it was through directing serenity that joss whedon showed that he can easily and comfortably venture beyond tv land and into feature films his colleague jj abrahms and his gang also made that same successful leapit thus came as no great surprise that the turned out to be such a fun ride not to mention an insanely profitable one it speaks to the vision and talent of the man who helmed the project and what that imagination and talent can do when given the appropriate resourceswhedon managed to take the several superhero movies which served as interconnected instalments or prequels of sorts to this movie iron man 1 and 2 the incredible hulk captain america the first avenger and thor and successfully and quite masterfully bring them all under the umbrella of the a fitting conclusion though im sure based on the endcredits that a sequel is in the works to this whole marvel universe enterprisei am not as floored with the movie as the audiences apparently are but given the number of actors and characters populating the screen whedon did an admirable job letting them all share the spotlight while keeping the story rolling he was able to imbue the story with enough substance and gravitas so as to prevent the movie from becoming just another unremarkable brainless bigbudged popcorn dud yeah yeah john carter and battleship youre what i had in mind the does not come close in quality to the quite unfairly overlooked xmen first class or any of nolans batman flicks but for what it was meant to be a summertime season opener it more than achieved its purpose and probably set the standard at least moneywise too high and potentially out of reach for the other bigbudget releases of the summerif nothing else i can say i had fun watching the but with joss whedon at the wheel you do get something extra in terms of quality over quantitybravo whedon im looking forward to you spreading your wings even further,fantasy
comic book nerds like other nerds worry a lot about film adaptations of the works they cherish this is for good reason since the majority of comic book movies cbms created so far are still bad to awful but ever since brian singers xmen in 2000 theyve been mostly getting better xmen was revolutionary because it was very good camp was minimized and it was the first watchable film to feature a super team is revolutionary for the 1st two reasons and because it weaves together 3 previously existing movie franchises plus supporting characters into a unified cohesive whole imagine if someone tried to blend the terminator with james bond a lot of us nerds were worried that this movie would be a big crowded confusing silly bit of idiotic posing and exploding emptiness but fortunately it is not so the script is true to the respective characters and is great fun especially to anybody who grew up reading marvel comics we called ourselves marvelites back in the day and when we were 12yearsold reading marvel comics we felt that the marvel universe was somehow real in a sense we couldnt articulate and deep down we all wanted to be heroes living in a world of other heroes this movie gets you as close to that as you can at least within a theater we comic nerds like our heroes and we want our heroes to have interesting and distinct personalities we like them to have weaknesses and emotions but we like them to suck it up and be heroes when the chips are down and at the same time we dont want them to cross the line into corn or camp well i guess you cant avoid a little corn but thankfully there is no camp this isnt citizen kane mind you but then citizen kane didnt have the hulk so there you go based on what my nonnerd friends say this film is good fun for nonnerds too,fantasy
imagine taking only the best parts of each individual marvel superhero movie and then putting them all into one movie that is marvels the the first ever superhero crossover movie in the thors brother loki comes to earth seeking a cosmic cube known as the tesseract which acts as a doorway between realms of reality loki steals the cube to unleash an alien army bent on trying to take over the world and the earths mightiest heroes iron man thor captain america and the hulk must unite to stop him as the its a simple plot and writerdirector joss whedon doesnt try to make it any more complex than it needs to be because he would rather shift the focus to bringing the characters together and giving each character significant development that is what is so spectacular about the it is like the superhero equivalent of seven samurai or the magnificent seven evil bandits aliens are going to attack a town earth and the town must recruit a series of defenders the to protect them when the attack comes what separates the from other superhero movies though is the fact that it is bringing together robert downey jrs iron man with samuel l jacksons nick fury chris hemsworths thor and chris evans captain america the movie gives each character an equal amount of the spotlight allowing each individual character a moment to shine and shows an arc for each character as the movie progresses whether it is iron man realizing that a true hero must be selfless and not selfobsessed or captain america realizing that his blind faith in the government is not always the right way joss whedon deserves huge kudos for making this all work with a sizzling script that is clever and witty and a great directorial hand coming up with comic book panelstyle shot designs the movie excels from start to finish and the action if you want explosions the has them and plenty of them but to be honest i was most enthralled by the moments when the characters were in a room talking arguing and revealing backstories about one another the dialogue was so crisp and the acting so marvelous with a surprising turn by scarlett johanson as shield spy black widow the is never boring even when there is no physical explosions to be seen but rather explosions between the character relationships most importantly though the movie speaks the message of unity of disparate people having to come together and set aside their differences to fight a common threat and there is no greater message that can be delivered to todays children with this movieby the end of the there is a realization that superhero movies have forever been changed never has a superhero movie been made on such a large scale and been successful as great as joss whedon and all of the actors are  in particular my favorite performance being chris evans as captain america  the real winners are marvel studios no movie studio has ever rolled the dice this big on a series of movies they made five individual movies that all come to a head with this one gigantic epic and the payoff is more than worth it not just making this the best marvel studios production since they started with iron man in 2008 but its one of the best superhero movies in general this is marvels finest hour assemblei give the a 10 out of 10,fantasy
i just came back from seeing and let me tell you its mind blowing this is how transformers saga should have been all that beautiful cgi eye candy pleaser mixed with some genuine well written script wonderful acting and a very well character development thou some characters shine a little more than others everyone are given their share of screen time it doesnt feel rushed it doesnt feel forced all scenes feel natural and very well deserved to be inyou get to know the history about some characters like black widow and hawkeye  and it remove all doubts about them being implemented in the team everyone needs everybody in order to succeed as i said before is transformers without the sucky part no one can say its another cgi fest cause its an excellent movieas to my favorite superheroe movie i have to say dark knight still is cause the story was a little better but is following closely as second spot surelly just have to wait and see how dark knight rises perform,fantasy
i love joss whedon i love some comic book movies xmen daredevil batman i like quite a few of the actors in thisso why on earth did i hate it so muchfor me the style was probably the worst thing some movies grab me and make me watch this didnt from the outset it felt like a high budget tv episode the look felt stark and unrealistic or actually too realistic probably it seems to have been filmed for 3d because even in 2d you you just get lots of weird camera angles and a strange tone to itthe story well i just found it hard to pay attention for even the most shortest of times it just was people doing stuff but no sense of direction or story or building menace in fact the menace looked like a stargate tv series villain or something from a kids movieand the thing is with stargate i love the characters but i dont with this film they give me no reason to love them so their actions are thus uninterestingit doesnt surprise me seeing afterwards that joss whedon directed it and it shows  hes a good writer but doesnt have a lot of directing experiencehaving said that what do i know look at the numbers its madebut for me i couldnt even watch it all the way through it was completely not captivating,fantasy
the only reason why this film deserved even 3 stars is because of robert downey jr his character is the only one that really seems like he knows what he is doing and does it well everyone else could be anybody its just a generic badly designed action movie the ending sequence and other action sequences seemed to drag and they made you look forward to the ending besides the iron man parts of the movie the best part had to be the beginning trailers for better movies like the dark knight rises i have to say that they should of just made another iron man film which would have been more fun and not a long boring cgi movie if you must watch go to see the trailers and robert downey jr,fantasy
i went today to the 3d version of the movie in antwerpen belgium let me start to say it is very entertaining and its almost more a comedy than a marvel movie why i not rate this movie higher is because there a lot of flaws in the storyline and they step over a lot of issues to easy iff you compare that for example with xmen first class or ironman the story lines are much better so i dont really understand why the reviewers before me dont talk about that enough the enemy is very weakalmost a single shot would kill them and i still dont understand why loki was doing in the plane and why he would let them catch him and the attackers were saying that there boss would come what happened with him  also no variation in the enemy and what about the hoovering cockroaches who only flew against buildings did nothing from characters the blackwidow was pointless she is just shooting with a gun and hawkeye is shooting with a bow how is that faster than a gun this movie was saved in the first part by tony stark character extremely funny and the hulk character in the second part of the movie but how hulk came a very smart monster who knows what hes doing i still dont know but still its a movie worth going to the cinema but its def not a movie which is worth a 84,fantasy
seriously  this movie is really over rated i watched this movie last week  me and my friends drove 50 kms to watch this movie and all we got was a boring movie the movie is very slow in the beginning and introduction of heroes didnt give much effectunwantedextended action sequences and lots of unwanted dialogues made the movie dragging if the was movie a little shorter with less conversations it could have been a better movieanyway the endclimax action was good but still if hulk was not there this movie could have been a failure  i would saybeing a huge fan nolans batman might have made me to hate this movie nolan changed the way of super hero movies he makes us to think and each dialogues or conversations have meaning or something related to the storyits time for superhero movie directors to learn something from mrnolan waiting for the dark knight rises m nolan m,fantasy
i like super hero movies if well made they are lots of fun if they are done by a masterthey are very good the latest batman the first xmenthe 1st spider man i watched all of the characters in this movie in their previous solos enjoyed iron man the most robert downy jr is one of the best actors ever thought that thor was very entertaining and funny and definitely a pleasure to look ati enjoyed the last hulk with enorton and watched cptamerica  home saved on the ticketand thought it was okwe went to watch it after seeing the rating so this movie is entertaining if you like lots of cgis and action there is no originalsurprising story the acting is good they brought good actors you wouldnt expect less we laughed twice the hulk character provided the much needed relief you will enjoy it on a big screen but thats it 86 really how many times you can watch manhattan destroyed time and time again in every other cgi moviegrow up and get more originaland yesavatar was better i gave it a 5 to lower the expectations of people who go to watch a movie on the big screeninstead of watching it  homeif you like cgis and a predicted plot it deserves between 67 if you expect a masterpiece like the dark knightthis is not its not even iron man the 1st it was very disappointing,fantasy
of all the newest marvel films this is the one i wars most disappointed off nothing about is is good only downey jr as ironman is doing well and does what he can not be boring as they others the first time wee see hulk hes angry on every one and the the second time hes only after the bad guys for some reason it doesnt make any sense at all  one off the biggest failure in all off the superherogenre and why the hell is captain america bigger than ironman in some scenes and on the main poster for the movie and then the movie is so confusing and unrealistic i really dont hope the next one is coming any soon but if it is josh wheedon have to stay away and give space for matthew vaughn,fantasy
i went to see the in a movie theater in paris it actually seemed kind of strange that it premiered there a week before it did in the united states nevertheless i wanted to watch it in order to prove to myself that some marvel universe productions based on comic books can be outstanding unfortunately as i left my seat i thought that like all the previous onesuperhero shows it disappointed me entirelywhy should you askbasically the plot is childish but i wouldnt expect more from a big budget blockbuster made only to pleasure the masses as of now it can somehow achieve the greatest opening ever wow it already made a fortune from the great marketing campaign that started weeks before the opening day thats truly brilliant considering what is being advertised throughout the world as one of the best movies in yearsi must admit it is strangely awesome that they were able to assemble such a cast of stars and pack them into one twohour film the names speak for themselves but what can be achieved with so many highlypaid actors when the whole idea behind the picture seems dull i love to see all of the wellknown faces shown on the screen together at one particular moment but when the scene isnt entertaining the point is really becoming unimportantthe dialogues are cheap they do not show any insight into the characters positions in the circle of the of course in order to fully understand who is who and the relations between the heroes it is mandatory to watch all of the movies that show the origins of every single person now i want to point point some out a few aspects that make the movie a little more enjoyable there were a few nicely implied gags that made me laugh most of them were connected with hulks turbulent nature and that is always a good thing to make fun of also the many sarcastic but highly intelligent remarks made by tony stark made me believe that iron man must certainly be the most amazing guy in the entourage additionally i would like to note that you dont have to watch the movie in 3d in order to get the best experience the enormous potential of this technology isnt actually given all of the epic major explosions blasts rampages and spectacular fights are providing great special effects in themselves this is the part that is probably the most pleasurable  when the team do not speak to each other but just fight their way through evil forces in order to stop loki thors brother action sequences are decent and the camera motions that shifts between all of the battling heroes deserve a recognitionall in all i have to say that i would much rather read the comic book while riding a subway to work than waste my time seating in the cramped cinema on a thursday evening now i just have to hope that all the other 2012 epic superhero productions will be better because even after this slight disappointment i still believe that this year will provide the greatest entertainment in this genre that the world has ever seen,fantasy
all the best aspects of the super hero movies of the last few years rolled into one to make the best superhero movie so far the film gets straight to the point loki steals the tesseract are called together and whamsit back and enjoy the fightridethrill and humour tony stark adds excellent spark and quick one liners just as he does in ironman 12 thor captain america and hawkeye all play there part in taking down loki and his army of aliens but for me the hulk is for the first time in a movie genuinely scary and fierce as he destroys almost everything in his path the film really works as it stays well clear of any love interest that slows down so many other superhero films black widow is the female lead and she kicks butt with the best of them all in all this is a brilliant film that is superheros vs super villains if that sounds good to you go see this film  then watch it again tomorrow,fantasy
i watched the trailer for this film and kept saying to myself i have to see this it looks amazing finally went to see it shortly after it was released in cinemas and was not disappointed one bit it contained plenty of action and the humour certainly made it betterthe hulk smashed everything in site thor went berserk with his hammer captain americas shield is cool iron man  well  he took on all of those drones in the final battle he managed to get a suit on in midair and he has the hottest girlfriend so wish i was him he was amazing i think robert downey jr suits the part of tony stark really wellits like the character was made for him and am definitely looking forward to iron man 3 next year along with an 2 if one is being madei recommend this film to everyone who loves superheros and who loves action,fantasy
in late 1930s when people were huddling in queues to see scarlet ohara being declined by charming rhett butler a rather unknown pulp magazine publisher martin goodman founded the company named timely publications it started to publish marvel comics which was an instant success and over the years a small company evolved into a huge corporation worth billions of dollars now the work of more than 70 years is crowned with the latest product  movie of colossal proportions designated to be a boxoffice hitmore than 200 million dollars gross on the opening weekend already over 1 billion dollars gross worldwide 87 rating on imdbcom and 242 out of 260 fresh reviews at rottentomatoescom  those are only some of the astonishing numbers that surround marvels the its a dreamcometrue movie for the comic book lovers which finally unites most of the greatest superheroes created by marvel it is no surprise that this picture is breaking boxoffice records on the other hand its high imdbcom rating and universal critical acclaim are unexpected and force to treat the as a serious film and not as another michael bay movie those were the standards that i used in order to assess the featurefirst of all i must point out that the story is very conventional and lacks boldness it is a bit ironic because the movie shows us a bunch of courageous heroes and one of the main values that the highlights is bravery however its creators rely on a simple and timetested plot formula the movie begins with the presentation of the threat when we meet a dramatized villain our superheroes struggle to defeat the villain because of the lack of team work during the movie their personality disorders are probed and eventually overcome they learn to work together and finally win the battle thanks to a heroic act of the main superhero it is funny because there are tons of other movies that would fit to this generalized plot summary and most of them are better examples of making money rather than good moviesas if that would be not enough the feature is stuffed with unoriginal ideas and tasteless jokes designed for the american audience the villain loki tom hiddleston  god from the norse mythology shares the basic ideas and he does not have much of them with all of the greatest threats of the usa enemies real or fictive starting from the commies and finishing with the latest ones including s hussein m gaddafi and the whole north korea those ideas are the enslavement of human beings cruelty towards them and basic misanthropy i can only imagine how fellow americans rage when dreadful loki declares that humanity craves for subjugation and his method of achieving the success is even more banal yes ladies and gentlemen i am speaking about the divide et impera principle hey if it worked for caesar and napoleon why shouldnt it work for loki that bastard actually in one scene lokis brother thor chris hemsworth reveals in another tasteless joke that our mighty villain is adopted so this is not just a disproportionate cursing has stolen everything speaking about jokes as i already mentioned most of them are not very new they range from the standard laughing at someone enduring the pain to laughs triggered by villains failure for the sake of truth i should say that there are some amusing characters like captain america chris evans and his maam theres only one god and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that or agent phil coulson and his laughable passion for the captain america and his cheesy dying scene but i am not sure if they were supposed to be amusing in a way that they wereon the other hand the movie is not a total failure and has its moments firstly robert downey as tony starkiron man and mark ruffalo as bruce bannerthe hulk do a great job giving their characters depth tony starks wit and charm jarvis you a fan of jonah helps to make a likable character that seems to be really created and not borrowed from some stereotype bruce banner on the contrary is a shy guy who is ashamed of his alter ego and there can be seen a certain sadness in his eyes every time we see him though i still think that making him a doctor in an indian slum was a standard marvels overreach another plus of the movie is its visualization cgi really looks great and i can clearly see where the movie budget went fighting scenes although i find them painfully long are nicely done it is a pleasant experience  seeing it at the theater however the same can be said about the transformers to sum up the is clearly not a movie which i would rate highly for its content and lasting legacy i do not believe that there is much originality in this flick and it certainly does not raise the bar for comic book movies because there simply are better movies in this category we all know what i am talking about however it still is a decent form of entertainment and its visual aspect should not be forgotten so if you have not seen it i should suggest to approach it with caution and if you did see it well i suggest waiting for another movie and we will try again to look through the debris of gigantism in search of dramatic life20120517,fantasy
youve already seen the and thats ok youve seen it in every other marvel movie yet released youve definitely seen the finale and even the mcguffin because they took it straight from the first transformers movie the is great fun but its fading from memory faster than who won last seasons american idol while fans of joss whedon will likely be pleased i think his victory with the is a double edged sword he carefully corrals the thicket of big names here but in the process were stuck with a laundry list of clich scenes a very weak villain dialog that exists purely to waste time and characters who rely far too much on their costume to get them through the movie one cant shake the feeling no matter whose names appear as writers the smacks of committee construction excluding sam jackson most of what is here is by the numbers there are precious few moments of humanity in a story that should be overflowing with it in this respect think this movie is a polar opposite of ang lees hulk a film that was painfully boring but also full of human touches  it had a style that could have been robbed like a gold mine to add more character in the place of the dreadful and endless expository dialog exchanges before were shuttled to the michael bay transformers action scenes weve seen a thousand times by this point but is it bad heck no the is ultimately a good time if you can settle for less there are no motivations for anything in the film other than to recycle everything thats already been done and play it safe to please an audience yes youve seen the already but thats okb,fantasy
since the epilogue in iron man 2008 when nick fury broached the idea of the initiative to wisecracking tony stark marvel comics has been patiently whetting our appetites for the this imaginative ensemble epic assembles not only iron man and hulk but also thor captain america hawkeye black widow and nick fury agent phil coulson is back too ostensibly these paragons of virtue are all that stand between thors scheming stepbrother loki and the fate of mankind happily loki brings more to the table than he did in kenneth branaghs anemic thor indeed thor and loki seem to have matured considerably during the interim loki ranks as a firstrate villain he is ready willing and eager to kill anybody who confronts him and actor tom hiddleston relishes every moment ultimately the qualifies as marvels ambitious attempt to deliver an allstar noholdsbarred alien invasion thriller to rival both independence day and transformers franchise of course we know that our heroes wont capitulate but this 142minute pg13 extravaganza takes everything down to the wire inevitably the extraterrestrial villainonly hardcore marvel comics fans may recognize himwho boasts about subjugating earth is as presumptuous as audiences who fail to appreciate the artistry of the unlike other ensemble pieceslike the venerable star trek movies that always relegated some regulars to obscurity the gives everybody a chance to perform an integral part in this largerthanlife smackdown reportedly serenity director joss whedon shot more footage of captain america than reached the screen nevertheless the fishoutofwater world war ii hero still participates in a major way melodramatic with more humor than you might imagine but just enough tragedy to make things bittersweet the doesnt wear out its welcome moreover this farfetched nonsense holds up under repeated showings ive seen it four times and it loses none of its spontaneitythe opens with audacious asgardian exile loki tom hiddleston of archipelago cutting a deal with malevolent aliens elsewhere in the galaxy and then appropriating a formidable source of energy the tesseract from nick furys samuel l jackson shield outfit if youre interested the tesseract showed up initially in captain america the first avenger once loki gets his powerhungry hands on the tesseract he plans to unlock a portal in space with the expertise of professor erik selvig stellan skarsgrd of thor so an extraterrestrial horde the chitauri can invade earth the chitauri are reptilian warriors with humanoid body structure in silver armor that cruise the skies as trios in chariots along the way loki recruits hawkeye jeremy renner of the hurt locker to do his evil bidding with the help of his glowing scepter meanwhile fury recruits his own team first persuading steve rogers chris evans of the fantastic four who has not quite grown accustomed to the 21st century to join him chiefly captain america doesnt know what most of the popular phrases mean former russian spy natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson heads off to calcutta to round up dr banner eventually iron man shows up too thor barges him when he discovers that loki is up to no good everybody boards a futuristic aircraft carrier that does more than ply the seas whedon does a masterly job of interspersing comedy with drama moreover he manages to ante up enough time for each hero to make a contribution as they struggle to defeat lokiwhedons the emerges as the climax to several recent marvel comics super hero escapades thor and captain america toplined their own respective origins stories and generated well over a 100million in box office receipts if youve been keeping track of marvel movies you know the least successful super hero of the quartet is the hulk unlike iron man thor and captain america the pugnacious green gargantuan never formulated the right mix of leading actor atmosphere and narrative tone marvels two hulk movies failed to forge a charismatic hero after marvels major success with him on prime time television director ang lees hulk 2003 with eric bana as the title character took itself far too seriously and tackled unpleasant issues such as child abuse marvel rebooted the character with director louis leterriers the incredible hulk with edward norton as the eponymous character this adventure surpassed hulk but remained halfbaked unfortunately actor edward norton feuded with the studio over the films interpretation of the material happily for hulk lightening strikes the third time mark ruffalo looks ideal as dr bruce banner and whedon literally has remade the hulk in ruffalos own image hawkeye and the black widow arent exactly in the same league with luminaries like iron man thor captain america or hulk these two are conventional agents of shield with special skill sets neither however possesses herculean prowess lastly ubiquitous agent phil coulson hasnt changed an iota like nick fury coulson has appeared in most of the films more than any other character coulson makes the greatest impression in the when loki throws down the gauntletthere are two kinds of super hero movies first you have the brawny exciting sagas with sparkling verbal repartee like iron man and captain america that are lightweight and exhilarating second like batman begins and the dark knight you have those that are dark literate complicated and rely as much as possible on realism the belongs to the first category and whedons opus ranks as one of the best the action never sacrifices its momentum for expository information about any of the heroes iron man has lost none of his quirky antiheroic personality captain america is still as straight as one of hawkeyes arrows hulk acquires a mystique lacking in prior incarnations and thor becomes the hammer wielding equivalent of an intergalactic lawman again lokis machinations keep thing interesting the is the kind of movie where you need to stick around even as the end credits roll to learn more about the villains and the heroes,fantasy
having cracked the problem of superhero movies with successful runs on spiderman and xmen both franchises contracted out to major studios marvel went independent with assorted features based on their lesser known characters  hulk iron man thor and captain america  and did very well with a series of oneoff movies which were commercially and critically well received importantly these movies were conceived from the very start as essential building blocks moving towards this film which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have headlined their own movies and who now appear together ok so im ignoring abbott and castellos role in bringing together dracula frankensteins monster and the wolfman so sue methe problem was always going to be how to deal with bringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have carried his own movie  surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other or else the movie will be nothing but a testosteronefulled pssng contest it turns out that it is both these things but the mix is beautifully judged by entrusting the script and direction to joss whedon  ace script doctor master at working with ensemble pieces and lifelong comic lover and excellent comic writer one might also add the balance  for balance was always going to be critical in this movie  is perfecti wont say anything very much about the content because there is so much in this movie to enjoy it is simply full of small touches among the bombast which will bring delight to the average viewer who likes an actionpacked blockbuster and absolute joy to comic lovers the characters which have been established in the previous movies are all here and they are all the same people  they havent been changed for the but they have more depth and there is also character development here the script is terrific and the action is stunning oh and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the endby the way thank you so much for saddling this movie in the uk with the ridiculous title marvel assemble which communicates even less to a noncomics audience than the and also depriving us of the iconic logo and title on the main title screen,fantasy
while i rated antman and its sequel along with deadpool well this movie was not great like most movies of this genre it was just a big fight scene and scenes of people using their powers interspersed with the glorifying of the u military i would never in a million years watch this movie againthere is more to say on this film however i dont like this film for the same reasons that i dont like the 2009 star trek movie it just ends up being one big battle scene and you dont know what is happening or with whom becoming extremely hard to follow i dont mind scifi films or those with battles but it needs to be something organized where you can understand what is happening rather than not as that lessens the enjoyment of watching movies such as this perhaps i am also negative about this film as i generally do not like superhero movies as they seem a bit too elitist for my taste which is why i like films like deadpool or deadpool 2 which lampoon this absurdity directlyid like to end by saying that this film will obviously be liked by many and probably did swell in the box office so in these opinions i am likely in the minority but that is fine as i am wholly principled about my opinions on this film,fantasy
this marvel studios film is the best superhero film weve been waiting for so long for everyone to watch and have a whole lots of fun with superheroes this is amazinggo iron man captain america thor hulk black widow and hawkeyethe will return,fantasy
i watched this again recently 2016 after ive already watched all the other marvel and superhero movies that came after it and this is still superior by a wide wide margin the only superhero movie that eclipses this one is dark knight imoconsidering the problems we think dc is encountering trying to cram up their heroes into one movie the did it flawlessly the dialogue isnt exactly glenn garry glenn ross of course but 99 of it keep you interested the transitions to each scene are unbelievably fluid the end of each scene almost always has a witty connection to the next the objective viewer doesnt struggle at all to ride the wave of the movietry to imagine if you havent seen this movie but youve seen all the others try watching it again youll see what i mean,fantasy
disclaimer i am a comic book collector so my review is slightly biased by proxy but bear with me for a momentthe comics are some of my favorite marvel comics besides the new and the house of m comics but the movie didnt live up to the legacy of the comics the jokes in the movie were really good i gotta give them that but humor alone isnt a good foundation for a movie unless were talking about movies which pertain to the comedy genre which is clearly not the case herethe biggest problem that i personally had with the movie was the fact that 50 of the action in the movie happens on what appears to be a spaceship that is reminiscent to those of the start trek franchise i mean an invisibility cloak come on now is this a joke because im pretty certain that the quinjet didnt have this feature in the comics last time i checked anywayin my opinion they should have simply titled the movie attack of the spaceships because thats the only consistent theme in the movie spaceshipsalso all of the main protagonists acted like little children throughout the majority of the movie and then at the end they miraculously got a hold of themselves movie logic furthermore the hulks development was completely unrealistic at first he is this uncontrollable mess that cant be reasoned with but then at the end he has absolute control over his alter ego  movie logic such a learning curve is unrealistic to say the leaston a side note the new captain america suit looks goofy what were the costume designers thinking a helmet  remove the helmet and give him his protruding wings on his headpiece back for the love of godinstead of aimlessly pumping out movie adaptations marvel should take it slowly and try to focus more on the quality of their movies quality  quantityps im not even going to rant about the fact that marvel had to introduce yet another universe just to make the movies work because they are acanon by nature ergo noncompliant with the original marvel canon and the respective origin stories of the pss the reason why im so passionate about these types of movies comic book adaptations is because most people dont really care about the franchise for them some fight scenes and explosions are completely sufficient not for me thought i genuinely care about the franchise and would like to see movies that do the genre justice after all people like me nerds were the ones who made the comics a success to begin with long before there were any blockbuster movies about super heroes,fantasy
the youngest of marvel heroes iron man first appearance in comic format 1968 leads the way into a science fiction spectacle of superlatives robert downey jr portrays tony stark aka iron man with ease and occasional sophistication in times of crisis this is exactly what happens when the shield facility led by nick fury since 2010 given face by actor samuel l jackson is under attack by a mediocre villain loki who remains just a puppet for supervillian thanos to be one of the major action confrontation in part three 2018 and four 2019 of the marvel movie seriessoundtrack by hollywood veteran composer alan silvestri and digital cinematography by seamus mcgarvey only excellerate this hollywood blockbuster ride of summer 2012 directed by passionate director joss wheddon who had been trusted enough by marvel studios and operating executives at paramount studios to fulfil a cinematic vision of pace whoa and joyful acting beats avoiding any moment of this picture to be dulla standing strong contribution for the ultra high budgeted decade of professional filmmaking in the 2010s in hollywood,fantasy
such a great introduction to the first movie loved every minute of it,fantasy
well the movie was kinda good and bad it just wasnt all that great,fantasy
this one has changed the way superheroes movies are made,fantasy
the highly anticipated came to theaters when i was 12 and to me it was amazing the characters all interacting with each other were amazing thor was hilarious with  petty and tiny line being one of my favorite lines in the movie also iron man was just as great as always hulk was badass in this movie with his  im always angry moment being my favorite moment in the movie also him punching thor away and dragging loki and smashing him into the floor dozens of time just showed how strong he could be something that infinity war and endgame lacked loki was a better villain in this movie than he was in thor as he wasnt an avenger level threat physically but mentally he teared then apart the new york fight was one of my favorite fights in the mcu and it even mixes humor in the fight that showed us that they are still human beings then the end credit scene perfectly sets up the next movies as we see them eating shawarma  but for real seeing thanos smiling was chilling and still gives me goosebumps to this day overall a great movie with amazing characters action and one of the best villains in the mcu,fantasy
all 4 stars just for black widow and her tight suit storyline is 6yearold fans of marvel,fantasy
after seeing all these characters in previous mcu movies we get to see them all come together it was so cool loki made a fabulous villain and we got to see how smart this villain was this movie will always stick out in the mcu and will always be remembered,fantasy

iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor captain america the first avenger the is the ultimate culmination of all those movies which ranged in quality from slightly aboveaverage to excellent in my review of the first iron man i called it the pinnacle of marvel cinema it has now been topped the story goes that after captain america the tesseract ended up at the bottom of the ocean and nick fury samuel l jackson and shield pulled it out now loki tom hiddleston wants it due to its inherently unlimited power which will give him the ability to rule with an iron fist over all of earth unless the can get past their differences and stop him i have recently come to the opinion that director and screenplay heavily influence acting this may be a bit late to realize this but whatever it certainly seems to be true in this case joss whedon is apparently great fun to work with and his writing talent is wellknown both of these might be reasons why each actor performs better in this movie than in previous marvel films the highlights are chris evans robert downey jr and mark ruffalo each playing characters with hidden emotional depth that boils to the surface in the most commendable of ways especially the latter actor for obvious reasons though this trio leads the pack said pack is composed entirely of very strong performances something not usually seen in ensembles but which whedon pulls together with the greatest of ease joss whedon originally signed on for this project in april of 2010 he threw out former writer zak penns screenplay and replaced it with his own no disrespect to mr penn but i sincerely doubt his version was betterwritten than this whedons script shines brightly in nearly every conversation each one punctuated with his trademark nevermiss humor another thing he is known for is the characterization he imbues his writing with from buffy to the cabin in the woods whedon has never created a character that is anything less than compelling a rule that still applies even to a cast as large and starstudded as this interestingly and wisely this doesnt feel like joss whedons the this really does feel like marvels the with josss cherry on top the characters still match perfectly with their prevous cinematic versions the character development is so strong in fact that in battle none of the characters feel like more superpowered thugs they are actual people fighting for their lives and humanity of course superhero movies arent usually known for their characters the special effects department really outdoes itself in this film from the nether regions of outer space to the showdown between iron man and thor visually the film never fails to dazzle the action sequences are filmed and edited with a sort of grace with whedons signature shakycam and midshot zooms thrown in occasionally for good measure unlike most movies the action scenes are not edited in quick shots the camera rotates around our heroes as they kick extraterrestrial ass and various other techniques are employed to keep action shots as long as possible though unconventional this ensures that the action is just as absorbing as the dialogue and works well to this effect allowing both of those aspects to support each other this attribute is extremely hard to come by in movies but where you can find it treasure it upon leaving this film which i only did after the final credits had rolled many of those leaving with me were laughing and talking animatedly about this film recalling various scenes and how the quality fared in relation to other comic book films my opinion is that this is the secondgreatest one of the bunch second only to the dark knight story and thematic depth beat witty banter and numerous explosions any day however for those simply looking to be entertained right now you simply cant do any better than this,fantasy
810  a fun teamup that helped set the modern superhero genre into motion,fantasy
the is the definition of a perfect superhero film as it ticks all the boxes when it comes to humor action drama and even emotion not only did joss whedon understand how to tell any interesting superhero story but he added weight to it by giving each of the main characters a reason to be there the plot might seen simple at first but in reality gives you more than what you asked for the interactions between the characters are amazing and is the reason why i love these big superhero team films loki is one of the best comic book movie villains as he not only gets under the skin but also is able to tear them apart which leads to internal and external conflicts robert downey jr is the far the star of the movie as he maintains iron mans personality through out the film at a consistent level if youre looking for a really fun and exciting blockbuster the might just be that film,fantasy
this film will be a good buy or you can stream it the 7 years its been out it has aged very good the opening scene is how you open a movie buy it now,fantasy
well after my second time watching this so i can see all 4 films it was a little bit better than when i saw it the first time im not a guy for pg13 movies and im not one for marvel movies i mean ive seen almost all of the movies but im not a die hard fan i mean when a new mcu films comes out i do want to go see it but end up never seeing it im more of a john wick action kinda guy but i can take this and who know by time i see them all i might change my mind i feel like this is for kids and teens and i like movies that are for adults and rated r gore not all the time but most of the time this film was enjoyable for the most part and all the did as they were expected to a couple cool cinematic scenes during the final act which is clearly the only great part of the movie there are other good parts in the movie in the beginning and other times but not as good as the final act the middle part of the movie is kind of boring but i feel like they were saving the budget for the end i mean my eyes were on the screen the whole time so it wasnt like it was a bore i cant wait to see age of ultron because ultron look bad ass overall the movie did a good job representing the and i wanted to see al mcu movies in order but its all mixed around so that kinda makes me sad but im not a big fan of these movies but these movies will stick with me forever and i will never forget about these avenger movies i mean im 14 and this is the only avenger movies ive seen so far because i dont watch these movies ive seen all the hulk and spider man movies though anyway an mcu classic,fantasy
this film in essence is a fan boy film and hits all the spots you couldve asked for as a marvel fan most the negative reviews ive seen of this film pull on aspects like too cgi dependent and compare it to films like dark knight or watchmen although films like watchmen and dark knight are superhero flicks like its a very different ball park is a fun ride with enjoyable characters a great villain good action and it manages to do what no film of its time was able to successfully pull multiple main characters into a shared story which doesnt feel like overkill the cgi element wasnt that big of a problem for me either i do love practical effects and they trump cgi for me most of the time but when youve got such a heavy scifi story like this one you cant dream of using practical it would be way too expensive and would take something away from the film for me if youve never seen and you love action comedy and colourful costumes i urge you to check this out,fantasy
how 7 years had been flying since the 1st movie this a mans dream coming true,fantasy
after introducing us through the characters via solo movies this movie now teams them up in a highly enjoyable and fun movie highly recommended,fantasy
the first one to pull it all off the unites all our favorite heroes for a fun thrill filled blockbuster that some how was able to work because of joss whedons smart and quippy dialogue also love how human all the characters are because they never fully get along yet they make it work as they pull off one of the best third acts in movie history very iconic movie,fantasy
this is one of the best films ive ever seen not just because its a fun action film filled with characters that ive grown to love but because it was the first of its kind setting the bar for other multiplecharacter franchises its a first and because of this it absolutely has its flaws but its definitely a game changerdespite having seven lead characters counting all plus loki everyone got at least a few moments of screen time devoted to their development with seven leads thats pretty amazing we have the quiet moments the little gestures and phrases that have been picked apart time and again by the fans that have granted a depth to the film that wouldnt have been possible if this were the first time we met any of these characters and thats the real beauty of its a teamup flick but its a teamup of characters weve all been introduced to before even if you hadnt seen any of the previous films there was a sort of pop culture awareness around most of them by the time it was released that youd be hard pressed to go in blind about anyone except the characters who didnt have their own film yet and were however regrettably less important because of itcombine that with a wellloved director who isnt afraid to sucker punch his audience and youve got a perfect mix for a film that doesnt just thrill audiences with fight scenes that are largerthanlife but gets people to invest emotionally in a fictional world was released more than two years ago but the film is still being picked apart and very much alive in the hearts and minds of the fans because of marvels expert worldbuilding in every show every film you see threads that lead back or forward to other events in the universe and its this sort of continuity that the fans love they pick up on every little reference read into every word of dialogue every prop placement every choice that the creative team makes and this is what has made so successful it stands up to that test and even with ten films under marvels belt theres still very few inconsistencies especially when you compare it to the next largest marvel franchise xmen which has some major timeline problems around wolverineall in all this is a film that should be in every collection because its not just great its revolutionary,fantasy
some of the best action in any movie ever very funny great intensity entertaining to the max great villain a superhero landmark movie 6 viewings,fantasy
the is everything you would want from a superhero team up movie the characters are well written the story is phenomenal the action sequences are amazing and loki is one of the best villains in the mcu definitely one of the best superhero movies of all time,fantasy
this movie took four superhero franchises and created one of the best crossovers of all time the movie excels in almost everything the acting is amazing and all the actors of each of the superheroes will continue to be the faces of those superheroes for years to come the comedy is also a lot better than a lot of comedy movies loki is a really charming and likeable villain and he steals a lot of the scenes he is in the music is also pretty damn goodthe plot however is a bit predictable but it works and the movie isnt terrible as a standalone movie the character interactions in this film is pretty good and does display the personalities of the characters quite wellthis movie is a lot of fun to watch and definitely worth rewatching id consider it one of the best superhero movies and one that has revolutionised the genre as other studios such as dc are trying to replicate the success of these movies,fantasy
this movie started off the big budget franchise we loved for 7 years by now ok let me get into why i liked this film starting with storythe story is interesting as it kept my attention from beginning to end and it was so exciting for us to have our heroes come together to fight against loki but the doesnt have much of a story as it doesnt have layers to its story and its very simplistic compared to the complexity of the other films they told a cohesive and understandable storyline in this first filmsecond lets get into the characters of this filmthe characters have really great banter between them as you have really good chemistry between each member of the the main characters have backstory established in the previous mcu solo films that built up to the and the characters are elaborately written cap as an example is a brave soldier as established in the first avenger and his character sees in tony a man who wouldnt sacrifice himself or any kind of character inside the suit tony sees a man who got all his powers from a bottle who isnt worthy but they both prove each other wrong in specific mcu films such as tony who almost killed himself to stop the chitauri invasion on earth tony is a great character whos trying to do good and has guilt over his mistakes that hes done but i wish they had gone more into this backstory the only character i didnt like was loki the villain who you couldnt understand and you didnt know why he was invading earth hes just a big threat who wants to invade earth because he just wants to but all the heroes have arcs until they cooperate with each otherthird lets explore the themes of this movie theres deep themes of sacrifice teamwork and heroism the mostly are working as a team and from beginning to end they learn to cooperate with each other so they can defeat loki all the heroes are saving the world from loki an example of sacrifice is tony who almost sacrifices himself to save earth from the chitauri invasionfourth lets explore the acting the cast is amazing robert downey jr is the best actor here as you cannot imagine anyone else in this role and chris evans shows the bravery of his character here scarlet johansson is attractive and shes a fun female character whos a interesting spy mark ruffalo has more charming humor than the other hulk actors and hes always having fun in this role for me the cast was great as everyone did a good job on their performances and rolesnext let me analyze the visuals the special effects here are stunning as they all look realistic and the visuals are overly authentic as theres never a look at really fake looking cgi or special effects the movie did well in this category therefore i like the movie and rate it 810,fantasy
how is that this movie is so good even after masterpieces of phase three i rewatched it two times in a row which makes it a total of 6 and still loved every moment of it if i have to guess its the amazing chemistry between the actors and a great writing unlike awful game of thronesseason 8 which makes it tick there are no grade a actors in it  aside perhaps robert downy jr and sam l jackson yet in this one every one is a star both evans and hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and arent just a pretty face they are captain america and thor respectively and i cant imagine anyone else in that role a typical acting of mark ruffalo actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of hulk even better than ed norton whom i personally consider to be one of the best though notoriously known difficult to work with actors scarlet johanson gave a superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever not to forget everyone else who gave an outstanding performance this movie is not without its flaws yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides makes up for it i will give it a 1010 rating as this is a movie that started an craze for me so all the other movies even the bad ones fall into their place in this epic movie series,fantasy
i dont believe there exists a perfect 1010 movie but this one is the closest i could find to it it delivers on the big and the little the spectacle and the quiet moments the epic action sequences and the character growth even now with the larger roster movies like infinity war and endgame the og holds its ground as a masterpiece among not only its genre but of all other movies it will be very very difficult for another movie to replace this as my favorite film of all time,fantasy
the is all characters we have met trying to figure out how to be a team all of the consistent personalities conflicting with each other and then coming together hulk is a surprise beat highlight loki is a suitable villian and we finally got our set up with our main evil behind the curtains thanos and iron mans sacrifice is a worthy one 85,fantasy
thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces the lives up to its hype and raises the bar for marvel at the movies,fantasy
despite its oversized running time the is populist entertainment at its finest all the elements that make up a crowdpleasing blockbuster are here there are the lovable characters played by charming movie stars the snappy rattattat dialogue the truly breathtaking special effects and the sheer size of the entire project from beginning to end this feels like an event unfolding and its hard to accomplish that kind of exciting bombastic tone and extend even to nondevotees like myself luckily joss whedon is in full command of the medium here deploying a truly impressive array of allaround technical and filmmaking talents that are wellmatched by a superstar cast blessed with both acting chops and movie star charisma for most of its running time its a lot of fun but in the last half hour it becomes a downright floorshaking spectacle that showcases extraordinary cgi and sound effects in every frame,fantasy
theres not much to say about this movie other than thiss a great movie thiss the superhero movie we all wanted all of our favorite superheros coming together to take down a common enemy in the form thors adopted brother lokitom huddleston who wants to rule earth and will do whatever it takes to accomplish his goalsin addition to that they also have to learn to get along with each other if they want to save the world the acting writing action and effects are awesome the jokes always hit the cast have great chemistry and the actions just cool to watch the fight scenes are well choreographed and really get your blood flowing i wont give away the final fight scene but its epicthats the best way i can describe this movie epic thiss a must see for superhero fans,fantasy
the team is finally togetheri will admit that going into this film i wasnt sure that loki was the correct choice for an antagonist but he astoundingly does an amazing job i mean he was the bad guy in the first thor and for him to be the carryover villain in the seemed like it would be stale but he does a fantastic job i will admit that i felt like the crew sort of come together with a little more ease than i thought they would im not sure that the death of someone would have been enough to have them all come together in this way but clearly im wrongbecause thats exactly what happenedfantastic movie will definitely watch again,fantasy
this movie is great start of serise it is better than 2,fantasy
the marvel adventure could only go one way after the dismal captain america and thankfully things have got better the combination of superheroes actually seemed to work for me and the storyline was better than i expected clever that theyve used a villain from another world and another moviebut does leave me wondering where the next avenger film can go from herethe most pleasing upgrade for me is the incredible hulk from ed nortons boring and dull portrayal of this green monstermark ruffalo has transformed this beast into an integral character with all sorts of edginess that keeps the viewer hooked ultimately though once again the stand out actor is mr downey junior himself who just seems to get better with every marvel film he is in the witty lines and the persona which he displays as iron man is a joy to beholdwith the storyline needing to be a little farfetched marvel have done well to keep it just this side of the line of reality whilst recognising that something extraordinarily and extravagant would be needed to bring these superheroes together there are times in the film that its in slight danger of crossing that line stillnot bad at all in my bookj boss reviews gives8310,fantasy
this has been one of the best films that marvel has ever made great watch for anyone who wants to get into the marvel movies great watch would recommend to anyone wanting to have a good time,fantasy
was really super impressed with the story line sound effects were awesome loved everything about this movie hope they make something similar to this,fantasy
of all the movies this is the best one why because its the introduction to the team its raw its magic its new shiny and beautiful yes the other movies can be considered good except ultron of course  thats just bad but they absolutely dont have the magic of the first one at this point theyre just going thru the motions notching every box to say hey were superheroes first ones seem to be the winners  cap although the 2nd one could be argued as being better thor iron man and,fantasy
i think the title says it all i enjoyed every second of the movie worth watch and all other marvel movies im not a fan but when the movie is great its great,fantasy
this was probably one of my first super hero movies and it brought me into their world a wonderful story about a team of superheroes working together to fight evil the humor action plot and characters were all enjoyable and was a worthwhile experience,fantasy
i liked how met each other and how their relationships started building its perfect first chapter,fantasy
endgame prep began with me deciding to rewatch the three films starting with 2012s assemble as it was called in the uk i cant believe it was only 7 years ago it seems like so much longerthanos inexplicably given whats to come lends an infinity stone to loki so he can head to earth and conquer it in return loki will acquire the tesseract use it to transport his chitari army across the galaxy and then presumably hand the stones over to thanos following the loss of the tesseract nick fury instigates his initiative program pulling together some of the exceptional people known to shield to form a response unit to the threat of intergalactic warhappily aa still holds up really well the effects are still strong only one little scene of captain america outside the helicarrier clearly looking like a cgi stuntman and some weird scaling on hulk in the final stare down with loki there are some awesome scenes in it iconic even hulk chasing black widow down the corridor before leading into the fight with thor the puny god moment and essentially the whole chitari showdown battlecharacter wise its strong too starting some relationships that continue to pan out in the series friendships between romanov and banner and stark and banner the immediate antagonism between the opposites of stark and rogers but also starting caps distrust of organisations that would pay off in the winters soldier the character whose probably least like he is now is loki much more vicious and condescending in this than he becomes though even there there are moments between him and thorits not a perfect film though it does have quite a large block in the middle between the capture of loki and bartons attack that feels a little draggy again theres a lot of good character work here but compared to the later films its a little slow though it has funny moments its obviously not as referential as the films could become later when there were a few more of themthough its been superseded in quality over the years assemble remains a high point in the series and a real indicator of what a combined cinematic universe could offer,fantasy
this movie isnt given enough credit anyonethe was a huge gamble back in 2012 and although it may now feel quaint given the achievement that was last years infinity war joss whedon was able change the landscape of blockbuster cinema and make this whole thing possible almost every plot point in this film has since become clich whedon and feige laid out a blueprint for success that no one else has been able to copy since the joss whedon humour and snarky dialogue helped to pave the way that these characters would interact in the future and his unique approach to utilizing an ensemble cast makes this film worth revisiting over and over again,fantasy
thewhedon is much better a writer than he is a director on a scale of mcquarrie disappointingly joss whedon the director wouldnt even qualify as one for when it comes to map the ever longed battles by the fans he takes things lightly a lot whatever glory that bedazzles you on the screen is a pure feat of bravery on paper not on screen too much cheese and too much sweet his selfearned jaw dropping moments are spoiled by him by the bitter afterbirth of his fandom fortunately these battles are here as the starters the main course is the buildup to that battlewhether then you watch gleefully these characters argue egotistically or see a train of awegasping moves by them to overpower each other on screen there lies a profound poetry between these moments where you can see 8 year old whedon playing with his toys in his room creating banal engaging scenarios between captain and tony this crowd pleasing franchise saw the maybeexpected uplift from this chapter as it managed to bring out every adored content from humor to drama to juicy visual effects the dollars were written in the script and so it was visible on screenamong all the triumphs of whedon his biggest is combining these behemoth figures and weave out a compelling conversation that is worth ten times any battle shown downey is the singular actor that comes out with a sigh his performance isnt interfered by the intertwining of multiple plots which it seems like it did to others if aligned the priorities of the makers the characteristics of the characters that evolves into an essential element in the storytelling is their way in for this safe formula wasnt inscrutable enough to convince us that these guys the can avenge,fantasy
initiating the first crossover of marvels cinematic universe as well as for the the first installment brings us more than action and a whole solid story like iron man could bethe film tells us an alliance of supehroess that unite to defeat loki thors evil brother which the latter had to defeat in his solo filmthe film has a wellcarried narrative the cgi does not feel that it clashes during the film it is intelligent to bring us an antagonist rather than entertaining as others of other films and has a coherent reason why it does evil while the performances they are still cool as in their films the characters have these characteristics which make it more realistic and nothing flat which is half questionable is the soundtrack i mean this is not very important in this genre but placaras it was necessary to repeat the same music sequence like 12 times although out of it it remains in baundcrrack and is not distracting or annoying but prestandole attention questionablewhile in other sections it feels pleasant and serves tony is still arrogant but aware of everything that is happening and saves the world carrying the missile that was going to destroy ny sending it to a kind of portal where the   henchmen  of lokithor is still arrogant as in his film but this one concentrates on the same loki and what he can causewhile the hulk has a bigger role than normal now does not destroy things because if or destructive things now is right and does well without feeling genericmuch of this battle takes place in midtown manhattan where the sharpest sequences involve the huge snakelizardwavy snake dragon machine from loki which seems to have a mind of its own and is backed by countless coils at any given moment a avenger flies into the mouth of this leviathan and penetrates its full length emerging at the end of the business you wont see that in the human centipedecomiccon nerds will have multiple orgasms predicts critic david edelstein in new york magazine confirming something he had vaguely suspected about them if youre right its time for the desperately needed movies to reeducate the nerds in the joys of sex the is well done by joss whedon with style and energy it gives your fans exactly what they want if its exactly what they deserve its mootanyway its a good movie anyway 355,fantasy
im writing this with only a mothe till end game comes out and i hope it is as good as this it was the base of many films to come like iron man 1 it is amazing if you havent seen it i would recommend it i cant think a reason not to,fantasy
i dont know how this could be any better the whole team coming together each a standout contributor and add to that joss whedon great characterizations performances tone cgi action humour interpersonal interaction just the top of the line in its genre i give this film a 10 at its best out of 10 marvel action adventure,fantasy
i cant think of anything to do to make this movie better the writers and director nailed the tone perfectlyi know there are those who rate infinity war higher but that movie didnt me away like this one after seeing it in the theater i immediately wanted to see it again i love iw and have seen it numerous times but i love this one more if they didnt do this one right there is no phase 3 and phase 4 team up movies hardly ever work but this set the standard,fantasy
the was awesome it should not have been there were so many characters that writing a coherent screenplay and doing each character justice should have been impossible but nevertheless joss whedon managed to write an awesome screenplaymy only flaw because lets get it out of the way was that the first act was slightly slow but it needed to be slow to give the characters motivations and bring them together convincingly i was also surprised at how funny the movie actually wasall the character be it iron man or black widow were given sufficient screen time nobody look out of their depth everyone was in the movie for a reason and in the final battle all the characters proved to be usefulalso this movie gave us the best version of the hulk technically the movie was flawlessmarvel has always suffered with its villains i am happy to say that loki is one of the best villains ever he was manipulative cunning and charming at the same timebefore this movie so many superheroes coming together seemed like a dream marvel was betting everything on this movie and this movie succeeded it has changed hollywood forever whether its a good thing or a bad thing is a debate for a different time but this movie succeeded in everything it set out to accomplish,fantasy
this is the best mcu film ive watched yet i liked the combo of everyone even though some of it is a little silly hawkeye and black widow are kinda silly characters that you wouldnt think would really be that effective fighting off the alien invasion but you can look past it because its a superhero movie thought sam jackson was a really good character loki honestly wasnt the best villain and it felt like either thor iron man or the hulk could beat him alone hed beat captain america and the rest of the crew but he wasnt the toughest villain although he did have that army with him which made him more dangerous and he could convert people to his side pretty good though,fantasy
joss weadon perfectly balances comedy and action with an ensamble of greats tom hiddlestons glamorous and styleous loki is brilliant and a joy to watch its sad that this movie didnt get nominated for best picture because it really really did deserve it,fantasy
i loved this movie i dont mean this is a masterpiece because it has some mistakes like the plot is bit simple and predictable and also i think hawkeye is very missed but overall is a really good movie very funny spectacular and very well made this is a great definition of a quality blockbuster,fantasy
one of the greatest films of the century it still surprises me how joss whedon managed to give every hero something to do which is something i kinda feel infinity war didnt do as well but what do you expect from a movie that crammed over 30 main characters and still make what is in my opinion the greatest movie of all time this movie is a prime example of a movie that gets better as it goes along the battle of new york is arguably one of the greatest action sequences in film history this also has the added bonus of being the first mcu movie i ever saw back in early 2014 all in all this was the film that really sparked the mcu to its full potential,fantasy
experiencing the origin marvel movies my excitement couldnt be any higher but a thought of combining the feelings into one has never crossed my mind however the mesh up of the universe founders blasted all the barriers and i got trembles of eagerness all over me iron man teaming up with captain america thor measures strength with hulk so many childhood dreams are flowing in the air and i want them fulfilled nowthe start gives a cold push to the plot in attempt to set up the main line but then also without any rush users us individually through every hero to finally make that eruption of boiling joy upon seeing marvel iconic creations together the pace after that runs down like a mountain river and your brain engorges the evens demanding more and morethose who expect some twists or mindbending storylines would be disappointed cause this is obviously an attraction to boost the popularity of this particular comic world to the global recognition instead of exercising your brain just relax and try not to jump from all adrenaline that fills you constantly during the whole sequenceevery character either old or seen for the first time builds up a pretty solid reputation and furthermore tries to look better among others that predictably gives us a peculiar showcase of abilities that increase a desire to meet with them closer in their spinoffsfinally through masterful visuals covered by supreme score by alan silvestri we get what was expected and even more a big bold statement of marvel that shows the ability to bring comic books into life in a jawdropping manner and along with samuel l jacksons promise we get our own one that the bottle of marvel has been just opened and all that champagne fizz is inevitably coming to impress us,fantasy
one of the best crossover superhero movie i have ever watched just one word for it masterpiece though i saw many people giving it 410 or 510 in the review section let me tell u same people gave justice league 101,fantasy
a really good movie you see enough of each of the characters with a great end battle,fantasy
6 may 2012 few ensemble movies especially superhero movies offer the balanced cohesive narrative that make for a well edited rich character developed and strongly compelling storyline unfortunately for the though recordbreaking at the box office not withstanding the can at best be considered entertaining but is more aptly described as a rather forced piece of movie scriptwriting and directing that attempts to corral a rather disparate bunch of superheros with mixed results unlike the more acceptable and appealing television series ensemble of super people in heroes 20062010 or even the more enjoyable animated feature film of super family members in the incredibles 2004 and the funny team of disparate members including the straight man female sigourney weaver and rick moranis in ghostbusters 1984 the awkwardly introduces its superheroes almost in sequel form some with even chaotic brief flashbacks that results in an uneasy alliance that feels quite uncomfortable as if the jess whedon himself was having trouble with his dialogue between the superheroes as an example gwyneth paltrow unlike rick moranis in ghostbusters 1984 is never given the opportunity to really have a solid place in the movie and even the highly praised performance of mark ruffalo as the hulk even this bipolar identity is left in doubt as the hulk is presented as two different personas earlier in the movie as this beast and then later somewhat more questionable as this conscientious animal which as an animal is quite unlikely a transformation there is an apparent imbalance in the presentation among ironman and captain america and thor xmen 2000 fantastic four 2005 and star trek 2009 all have a much more polished setups between their disparate ensemble characters instead joss whedon has introduced dollops of solid standup comic oneliners and humor that seems pretentious clever coverups even as they hit home unlike his own previous ensemble work in the well received buffy the vampire slayer 19972003 and angel 19992004 series here joss whedon is seemingly unable to recapture the same smooth but edgy magic as those earlier television series the storyline also seems to veer in several isolated superhero scenes that make the overall rhythm and flow of the story rocky in its depiction on the screen there seems too many characters and too many simultaneous events going on at the same time almost more the actor script contractual obligations of screen time rather than for the integrity of the story itself inception 2010 probably includes some of the best integrated separate story lines that are presented simultaneously in its unique movie within and movie within a movie technique or pulp fiction 1994 traffic 2001 and the air i breathe 2007 interweave several plot strands in a nicely enriched presented fashion it is apparent that some efforts at making this movie stand out with a few enhancements in special effects like the destruction scene shot from the perspective of one of the vehicles being hurdled in the maelstrom and several minutes of dialogue of lofty sounding metaphysical and emotional depth yet the overall impact is more superficial without the emotive and intellectual probing found in even more singularly focused superhero movies as green lantern 2011 elektra 2005 spiderman 2 2004 or spiderman 3 2007 of particularly note it almost seems like the news media has been influenced by overreporting the critical acclaim of this movie as metacritic rates it only a 69 which while good isnt really outstanding by any means contributing to a rather false marketing effort in itself suggesting that some movie critics are in league with the movie industry itself,fantasy
when the world is threatened by loki whos determined to bring an army of evildoers to earth a couple of superheroes are gathered together in order to form a team and defeat the upcoming invasion the only thing that apparently stand in the way is their ego each one of them having an idea of his own while teamwork is a word which apparently they dont understandits a movie which features a great invasion of earth while ironman thor captain america and a couple of others must fight back to defeat it and at the same time struggle to work together as a team its one of those movies which amazes through its visuals presents a good but overused plot in which marvel superheroes show off their powers while saving the world as i said before it looks astonishing the characters are well described and put into picture also very well played by their actors the fighting sequences are topnotch and almost everything is very good of course except the plot which simply wasnt enough to make it a masterpiece it is good enough to make such a movie entertaining and sustainable but not good enough to make it truly great i like these kind of movies where very popular characters with superpowers fight their way through saving the world but it tends to be a bit boring to see how the world is attacked by a not so impressive force of evil this time led by loki very well played but not so impressive as villain over and over again oh and as a result the ending is very predictable something with a bit more depth could have helped a lot in terms of story yes they tried to add a bit of additional suspense and even comedy through their opposing characters almost making them fight each other but it isnt enough from my point of view to make it a truly great movieoverall its a must see for marvel fans for superhero fans and for everyone looking to have a good time you wont be disappointed by any aspect of it just dont expect a breathtaking plot as there wont be one,fantasy
the is one of these rare movies where it lives up to all the tons of hype it has gotten it has made over 15 billion dollars and it has received high praise from both fans and critics and the success of this movie is very well deserved the really great thing about this movie doesnt come from all the action humor or visual effects it is to see all these characters interact with each other in one room joss whedon truly was the man for the job and he impresses once again with his ability to portray each character as meaningful as the other everybody counts there isnt one hero but six of them and they are all relevant and meaningful plus all their character development is superb all of them whedon has my full respect the visual effects in this movie are out of this world it really is spectacular and a joy to watch the cinematography is likewise beautiful in this movie but in the technical department all my praise and full respect goes to alan silvestri his score for this movie blew me away especially the assemble tune no gripes from me in the technical departmentas for the cast they are all terrific robert downey jr is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie mark ruffalo makes the best bruce banner aka the hulk to date with a serious and human yet comedic performance chris evans is still quite good as captain america as far as performances go this guy is probably the weakest but hes still an awesome actor chris hemsworth isnt a remarkable actor either but he has nice charisma and fits the role as thor scarlett johansson is smoking hot and sexy and much more relevant than she was in iron man 2 jeremy renner was agent clint barton aka hawkeye samuel l jackson was epic in the role of nick fury tom hiddleston is really strong and serious villain stellan skarsgrd and cobie smulders is also good in their supporting rolesive chosen to judge this movie with what it is a fantastic superheromovie and for that it has to get a 9 for me,fantasy
so i watched the trailer for the it has loki bragging he has an army to which tony starkiron man replies that they have the hulki supposed that maybe if i didnt know absolutely anything about the hulk from the comics i wouldnt have predicted the ending of the film with that i mean they had the hulk so what considering the cool and calm way mr stark said that i could conclude that he thought or more likely had it for granted that the socalled hulk was so powerful that anything even a whole army thrown on it wouldnt even tickle it just happens thats the case in the filmunlike most superheroes the hulk has no achilles heel apart from himself the more things you throw on the hulk the stronger he becomes infinitely and exponentially that piece of information is not presented on this film as far as i can remember and not even in any of the hulk films but i dont remember most of them so i cant be sure but it wasnt necessary the morons that cut that trailer should have known better than to put that robert tony downey stark jrs oneliner on the it yes it spoiled the ending for me and no i didnt watch the trailer on purpose it was shown when i went to the theatre to watch something else i was so shocked by the spoiling trailer that i cant even remember what i went to watch thenthis film is boring uninspired overhyped so badly scriptedplotted that it cant even be called pretentious is that good or bad for a film of this genre and the visual effects are so exaggerated that everything looks fake even so it has one of the best lines of all superheroes films ive seen it comes like this the film starts there is a lot of boringannoying blablablah and after mr stark tells loki that they have the hulk bruce banner reappears someone says him that it would be good if he could get angry to which dr banner replies sorry even with spoilers on i cant force myself to tell you this if you dont want to watch this film if i hadnt i wouldnt believe me its really that boring go to a search engine site and look for the hulk angry secret and watch a clip of the scene because its the only piece of all of it that is worth watching i cant say that that alone would be worth the price of admission but it surely put a smile on my bored face10 stars for dr bruce banners one line 7 for all the rest,fantasy
nick fury brings the gang together in a quest to fight evil but its just the beginning the hulk is recast with mark ruffalo who continues for subsequent films the marks the end of the first phase of the marvel universe although it isnt revealed until later the introduces a second infinity stone with lokis staff containing the mind stone he uses its power to brainwash characters like hawkeye you may like this movie if you are fan of marvel comicsyidioo,fantasy
the whole movie is easy to understand but outstandingthe heroes all have their personalitiesespecially robert downey jrhe expressed the character really wellalsotom hiddleston has amazing acting when phil coulson died the union of the touches peoples heart the mostthe description of the whole story is delicate i like the movie a lot go watch it people,fantasy
solid movie yes by the numbers absolutely not daring original or unique story wise in any way this is not a classic but glad 80 of people think its the new godfather apparently good for them but not for the future of film making which is now more about cgi wowing  explosions behind cgi superheroesacting is solid characters are interesting enough but they did not bring anything new to this franchise that we already know so well from previous films generic bad guys who all die at the same time like its star wars episode i are you kidding me and a bunch of hardcore superheroes anda woman with a pistol and a guy with a bowarrow who wears a leotard this is laughable but apparently our current audiences take this s h i t seriously whatever seriously,fantasy
ive just come back from the movies and i dont understand whats the hype all about i seriously want my money back the trailers showed lots of action scenes with fights and everything so thats what i was expecting what i get 1 hour and a half of pointless dialogs and discussions among childish iron man and captain america just to say the ones that are worseafter this 1 and a half hour i was actually rooting for loki even though he was a very poor character with not much of a personality or anything that can differentiate him from the clich villain towards the end the movie gets a little bit better with lots of action plus the fact that i love the idea of the superheroes together but thats all and its nothing really different from other films that ive seen latelythere was one last problem about the movie and all its hype the movie theater was crowded and everyone was laughing so hard at scenes that werent funny at all they should really decide between an action movie or a comedy and make a good onethe ending scene right before the last credits makes a reference to a possible sequel i presume i can just imagine how bad itll be if they follow the same pattern as this one,fantasy
i wouldnt recommend it to a friend but i wouldnt try to persuade them not to see it either i usually find imdb ratings fairly accurate the current rating of 89 suggests this movie will be something special unfortunately all i saw was something very typical very hollywood and very predictable as more people vote and the hype dies down this movies rating will fall below 8dont get me wrong you will be entertained if you watch it the special effects are  well special there are even several instances where you will laugh out loud there are some genuinely funny parts that i wasnt expectingthe problem is the story line is very unoriginal and youre never gripped by what is unfolding think transformers there are just too many clichs and many instances where things are simply not plausible even for superheroes i know its not meant to be realistic but you will be muttering under your breath yeah bull   at some of the outrageously unlikely feats ironmans midair ship repair is one particularly bad scene you should watch out forthe acting was acceptable given the script they were working with its hard to deliver a line well when its a god awful clich its the kind of thing where the actor just about looks at the camera and says lets get these guys or youre going to pay for that it sounds like an overly negative review but that has a lot to do with my expectations given the imdb rating see it if you want some thoughtless entertainment 610,fantasy
i have seen iron man 1  i like the moviebut iron man 23 are mere waste of timewhen i heard abt a movie which contains many super heroes i expected something goodand iwas by seeing it is rated 89 in the first dayi had expected a good story good actinggood actions and vfxsbut i could only find the last thing in the moviei downloaded a hd print of 25 gb within 8 days but after watching the movie i realized that i wasted my whole timei dont like captain america in his own movie toohe is not powerful and the actor is completely disappointing in the role 56 superheroes to fight against a halfly retarded villainonly hulk did provide some entertainment spent a large portion of the film wondering where hawkeye kept getting arrows from i understand that this was a summer blockbuster that alone makes me cut it a little slack but honestly i just dont understand how it made a billion dollars i also dont understand how the black widows presence in the final battle a largely aerial one wasnt like bringing a knife to a gunfighti dont like captain america in his own movie toohe is not powerful and the actor is completely disappointing in the role 56 superheroes to fight against a halfly retarded villainonly hulk did provide some entertainmentloki had something to do in thor that was a better movie than this,fantasy
i used to trust imdb scores but if this movie achieved to get a score above 8 stars than it is just a reasonable conclusion for me to move onwithout sounding mean has nothing not one single original idea the script was probably written by a bunch of marketing professionals and a mindless script writing machineif you find pleasure in having your daily coffee in the mccafe if you like to buy things on the tv shopping channel if hanging out in a shopping mall is the ultimate sunday plan for you than go for this movie you will not be disappointed,fantasy
this is dumbest and most boring movie i ever seen imax 3d didnt make it better the primitiveness of the plot and dialogs between characters is probably excusable for the movie built based on comics book couple of flat jokes and tons of trivial visual effects  that is a movie cheap fast food type of movie wo a soul and template based product for mass consumptionactors  the actors were acting well huh its their job after all scarlet was charming as usual  but unfortunately character she was playing didnt give her much area to reveal her actress talent i must admit her russian accent is very very awful  sad to see that so many people really liked that stuff giving high rated exited reviewstheres somethin wrong with the world today aerosmith,fantasy
i think disney must have hired a couple of hundred people to fill up the internet with glowing reviews because this movie is not worth all the online awesomebest movie ever quotes im seeing everywhere when i give it 5 out of 10 i think im being generous i was bored and disinterested at least at 2 or 3 different times in the movie so waste your money if you want at the theater but i suggest you wait to see it at home at least youll have a couch to fall asleep on to get through the middle part even the actors seemed disinterested captain america had no passion the king loki character was awful mottling feeling sorry for himself no fight i mean come on hes supposed to be a king bruce banner was flat flat flat at least when he turned into the hulk he had some passion,fantasy
i was really looking forward to the and i have to say i was disappointed lousy acting samuel l jackson whos usually reliable was wooden and had no real take on the character robert downey good thing he wore waterproof mascara for his closeups scarlett johanssson who needs to go back to acting school mark ruffalo what was his take on the part he just looked confused and lacked confidence dead spots that almost put me sleep some very cheesy fx using miniatures particularly noticeable in 3d lousy photographythe 3d glasses made everything seem dark and drab i found myself taking them off and seeing much brighter scenes im sure if youre a 12 year old sadly im not this movie is the best thing youve ever seen but there are so many other movies of this genre that are so much better on every level x men and the batman series in the capable hands of christopher nolan to mention two captain americas padding in his shirts was laughable did they run out of cgs because he looked much better in his own movie im comparing this movie to avatar because i was also disappointed with that one too as it relied totally on on special effects weak story line to make its success oh well ill look forward to the dark knight rises because i know christopher nolan will not let me down,fantasy
only scarlett johansson as black widow and jeremy renner as hawkeye come off as actors playing dressupbut despite the assured performances the is unconvincing the illusion doesnt stick the story ties itself into knots to rationalize why these disparate superheroes would ever band together under the supervision of nick fury samuel l jackson to thwart the villainous loki tom hiddleston right from the opening scene a belabored set piece boasting one of the most listless car chases ever filmed the movie feels off everyone talks too much the pace lumbers extraneous characters eat up screen time you hunker down in your seat and shrug it off patiently waiting for the film to kick into gear by the end youre still waiting,fantasy
introduction after watching both ironman movies all hulk movies thor and captain america watching is a sensible thing for me to dowhats hot great casts majority of them carry their parts well its nice to see all the familiar faces from previous moviesgreat action scenes and impressive visual effects the final new york scene is awesome so many things to focus on sensory overload ironman on the field steve rogers may be the unofficial leader of the team but it is tony stark who performs most of the important lifesaving duties the backbone of thescarlett johansson and cobie smulders enuff saidwhats not loki i understand that sometimes a couple of jokes here and there can be good but when some of the jokes come from the result of the main villain being stupid weak being thrashed around thats not good what makes a good superhero movie is among other things the villain his or her onscreen presence should instill fear uncertainties and in some ways respectalien soldiers there is no doubt that ironman hulk thor and capt america can kick aliens ass anytime anyday but black widow come on i understand that this is a comic book movie therefore any logic should be thrown out of the window but black widow beating many alien soldiers without much difficulties is way too much no doubt that she is a formidable fighter and can overcome many human opponents as we have seen in ironman 2 but to be on the front line during an alien invasion is a nono she is more suitable for espionage covert intelgathering kind of dutiesblack widow same as abovefamiliar story lines using a space portal to send alien soldiers and ships to attack earth we have seen that in transformers  dark of the moon huge alien attack craft that looks like fish also seen that in the same transformers destroying alien mothership using a nuclear warhead seen that in independence daypolice  army i know this movie is about a team of superheroes saving our world from alien invasion but the apparent lack of support from the police and armies in fighting the aliens is so glaring the freedom of 6 billion people under threat and yet you rely on less than 10 persons the results are our heroes performing less important tasks such as saving civilians cornered by weak and easily defeatable alien soldiers as evidenced by black widow in a bank and rescuing people trapped in a bus delegate those things to the police firemen or ground troops and focus on the bigger task of defeating loki and closing the space portalconclusionan enjoyable movie i had a good laugh on some of the scenes mostly involving hulk in my opinion the dark knight is still the best comic book movie and maybe the title will go to the dark knight rises in 2 months time,fantasy
so finally out but is any good no not good not bad but not good is movie that plays to lowest common denominator only stupid people like film it go too far makes comic fantasy into very silly comic not this silly comic in my country have adult themes and messages but this is punching and more punching few funny things mostly funny punching there is lots of punching first it gets silly then stay silly then feel like blaming you for being silly too with punching script make sense only if you hang on toilet wall not make sense in film people say film awesome batman awesome has story makers assume you smart enough to feed yourself this one assume dumb enough to chew off own fingers if try to eat hotdog is ok just not good iron man was good he good character funny and engaged with reason why he punching captain american not bad but too silly this one just too silly liked hulk a bit but was there hulk film dont think so hawkeye rubbish heros are legend god monster and funny armour man who drink a lot and hawkeye he has a bow and arrow he not scary my kid has bow and arrow used to he shot cat made him eat it only way they learn why they call they not avenge anything they should call something else maybe call them justice league that has nice ring and cute girl in tight clothes nice touch was ok and approve so not bad film like watching poor version of iron man or good version of captain american bit disappoint recommend for people with nothing better to do maybe people with little brain for big brain wait for batman instead or read book they are paper things with word sometimes picture if liked film you might not know this,fantasy
i finally watched this film after much anticipation and this movie is nothing but overhyped overpraised garbage imdb you should be a shamed by letting all these obviously underaged virgins that wouldnt know true filmmaking if it bitchslapped them in the face all you people are concerned with is special effects and unnecessary action if those two elements are in a film for you the character development creative ideas acting script and cinematography doesnt matter which is very sad and leads me to worry about the misleading rating system for the future of filmmaking this amateur film is currently rated 101 on imdb so you suggesting that this film is better than batman begins heat pans labyrinth blade runner rosemarys baby the deer hunter jaws warrior let the right one in and the list goes on if you think that the is better than the small list of films i mentioned then i feel sorry for you because you are mixed up in that group i mentioned earlier all the other truly brilliant films that are being unappreciated you still have one true film aficionado that will always separate the great from the garbage,fantasy
huge rating on imdb woaw really  well the movie must be good sobuthum finally after 2h and something well it has nothing to do with a 87 movieseriously like it is mentioned in several occasions in other reviews there is almost zero carachter developments zero plot zero reason for these heroes and villains to do what they are doing who is behind loky why the invasion whats at stack on the long run nothing but a series of pointless discussions and arguing between characters nothing morethe scenario is ten times viewed before the hole in the sky with monster coming to manathan i mean how long ago was ghostbusters made  the kind of flying worms are super close to the transformer 3 same type of monsters the screenplaystoryboard work are just average just a few stunning moment not epic developments no just a basic movie for kids thats all i can see hereto be fair and honest if the rating of this movie would have been what it should be around 6 to 7 i would have given a 4 or 5 rating but as obviously some marketing companies are pushing the rates up i must deliver a simple 1 to contribute to balance things for readers who keeps on looking at the rating before watching this in theatre or buying an expensive blue ray 3d dvdreally a below average action pack movie nothing more,fantasy
so glad to see that this movie did basically nothing wrong i had my fears and doubts about it i mean so many big superheroes in one movie isnt that like having too many captains on one ship but no everything i feared for got greatly and cleverly handled in the movie and i liked it even far better than expectedthe movie simply made all of the right choices it seemed it used the best elements from the iron man movies thor captain america the first avenger and the hulk movies not only that it also used the best of its main characters everybody of course has their own set of skills powers and specialties which greatly get used in the movie everybody gets to do something and gets about as much screen time as the other many people thought that tony starkiron man played by robert downey jr would steal the show and get most of the screen time since his character is the best and most fun one but no every hero gets their moment of glory in this movie and their moment to fully shine even those without the superpowers such as black widow hawkeye and nick fury played by scarlett johansson jeremy renner and samuel l jackson but if you would force me to point out one person that gets to shine the most in this movie it would be the hulk played this time by mark ruffalo you have never seen the hulk do so much awesome stuff and he also definitely comes across as the most powerful one of the bunchits so awesome and a true accomplishment that they actually pulled it off to get all of these characters and actors together for this one movie lots of characters from the iron man movies thor and captain america the first avenger reprise their roles in this movie which makes all of the movies feel more connected than ever beforeits also a real accomplishment that they managed to keep the same style and tone throughout the entire movie this also caused iron man to not take over the movie for instance with his wisecracking jokes or thor with his old fashioned shakespearelike dialog the entire movie feels like one big whole even when its purely focusing on just one of its main charactersi also really loved the interaction between all of the characters they dont all like each other and some are even somewhat suspicious of each other a true egoclash if you will which also results at times the different superheroes battling each other this is the sort of stuff that im sure of lots of fanboys and girls wanted to see it also was a great move to make loki the main villain of this movie he was the best villain in all of the marvel superhero movies in my opinion so personally i was very glad to see him return in such a big role again and yes every superhero has a go at him at one point in this movie which again is something that fanboys and girls will be drooling at especially since its all something truly great and spectacular to watchand it really is a spectacular movie basically its being like nonstop action fun and the movie its final perhaps is the best and most spectacular one you are ever likely to see truly some intense and awesome stuff to watch when all of the superheroes for the very first time truly work as a time and battle side by side with each other stuff that will give some people goosebumps for sure also because its filmed so extremely well with the help of some great looking special effects as wellbut how about the story well its nothing too great or original but this hardly harms the movie its all about its main characters coming together and teaming up for the first time on film really the story is totally secondary and most of the time you wont even pay attention to it since there is so much else good stuff going on screen joss whedon did a more than great job with directing this moviethis is basically how great fun spectacular big budget entertainment should be like810 httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,fantasy
 is a movie i have been waiting to see for 30 years with the style of the xmen  spiderman films in addition to the hulk iron man thor and captain american films it was pretty clear what type of movie this was going to be big loud slick exciting and light on story joss whedons influence has made for a much better movie his witty and sometimes intelligent screenplay lifts this from a middle of the road marvel movie to something that is a great popcorn movie all the performances are spoton and the photography and cgi beautiful this is very much a movie for the fans but anyone can enjoy it dont expect a complex interwoven plot but a classic good guys v bad guys movie loads of fun so leave your brain at the door and dive in,fantasy
the by marvel received high ratings from several movie sources and although the film attracted audiences it didnt leave the audience with an impression if you want a simple actionoriented flick with decent characters laughs good cinematography and some small levels of character transformation this is the movie for you however if you are looking for something that speaks to your soul entertains shocks and leaves you with an unyielding catharsis then forget about it the was rated in three fields cinematography story structure plot  theme and characterization of these it ranked highest in cinematography and store structure although it ranked fairly evenly in all three  a balanced and organized film however it lack focus and import regarding the theme and the plethora of characters makes it difficult for the audience to connect with their trials consequently when iron man undergoes his ordeal the audience feels disconnected and cannot experience the catharsis intended overall it was a good film with good acting organization and appeal but when it comes down greatness it doesnt fit the bill,fantasy
to start with i cannot understand how anyone can give this under 5 out of 10 stars let alone the ridiculous 1 star ratings we watched this movie knowing it was going to be a superhero flick so was basically going to have a lot of action scenes and naturally its going to be full of cgi also i expected some one liners that would be witty and corny if you expected anything different then your previous superhero movie experiences may of been categorized a little wrong all up it was a great movie and lived up to my expectations which is usually not the case it was a longer than expected movie and probably could of been shortened a little in the first half but all was forgiven once the heroes started showing off their skills some great witty humor some lines a little corny the storyline was not too predictable either unless of coarse you feel the superheroes saving the day is too predictable i left the cinema wondering when the bluray release date will be and debating who the ultimate superhero really would be,fantasy
ive seen it in 3d and im afraid to say its adding nothing to this film in fact like it happened in so many other films boosted for 3d the lighting is too dark for the rest the movie is as funny as the first iron man movie its made with serious but tongueincheek humour the cast in incredibly laughable all the main characters are played by great actors which is helping to support all the nonsense parts of the script the craziest one is certainly mark ruffalo whos playing david banner aka the incredible hulk the man is always angry and it takes a long time before we could see the deepness of his anger but the waiting is good the first part of the movie is just too slow it takes too much time to start as if the authors were trying too hard to explain every links with all the other marvel movies made before its not always useful its nice to see some more great actors like jeremy renner mark ruffalo and scarlett johanson to join this team,fantasy
story nick fury of shield assembles a group of marvel superheroes to stop loki from using a device he stole to inevitably destroy the world this really isnt treading any new ground as far as storytelling goes i dont know how close it is to the comic yes the superheroes are all pretty cool but thats why they each have their own film i feel that having all of them there didnt really allow for any development of the characters who all seemed to be competing for screen time it was fairly unoriginal considering the films out there an invading alien army comes to take over the world by which i mean an alien army comes and invades america the only place aliens ever seem to attack i feel they tried to fit so much in that the story in general was entertaining but also seemed a bit rushed and not very original as far as i could see it was something straight out of hollywood 255execution the film was directed in the same way you would expect from this type of film it had the epic explosive feel of a michael bay film to be honest i thought he may have directed it until i saw the credits at the end there were some pretty impressive action scenes which do enough to keep you watching right the way through it was never boring for even a minute however it was all very formulaic and the whole point of the film seemed to be to show off epic fights and to allow for cheesy lines from our heroes which come rapidly about every 5 minutes the acting was actually pretty good im not usually a fan of robert downey jr but he played his role very well samuel l jackson did what he does best playing the badass hes known for the acting was definitely the best aspect of the film 355verdict it was okay i went to see it with friends and we all thought it was a fun solid action film i just dont see what all the fuss is about everyone seemed to think it was spectacular i dont know if this was due to the hype or if it was people who read the comics i just cant say i thought it was anything special which was disappointing although i seem to be against the world on this one so dont just take my opinion see it if you enjoyed the second and third transformers films or if you fancy unwinding with an above average action film 255  355  610,fantasy
okay im expecting a fullpacked action film but instead i get a more drama than action film im not saying its bad its just not as i expected in an ultimate superheroes movie ultimate as more superheroes  more awesomenesshowever most of this film is more about battle of ego than saving the world actually their ego are the real threats to this world except hulk which seems there purely for action the others need some push and a good person must die like saving the world is not enough cause and a retaliationrevenge gives better reason so some reel time is waste for this superhero drama instead for action i kind of disappointed with these selfish superheroes luckily hulk gives several comic relief and save the moviethe action is slowly build up towards the end too slow for me but it pays off in the final battle not as spectacular as i expected but in the end it provides just enough reason why there must be a team like in this marvel universe the thing that disturbed me the most is those americans those people who happen to be in the wrong time at the wrong place  well not only in this film but also others like the transformers series etc the city streets has become the battle ground and those mortal ordinary people still there in the streets watching very closely like its just a parade or a flash mob and deliberately provide themselves as collateral damages whats wrong with these people is every americans so stupid or have suicidal tendencies audience can except the collateral damages the panicked citizens people runs for their life in the 1st 3 minutes of the battle but after that the filmmaker should simply have a scene of these people watching from afar behind road blocks with police guard peeking from a secure hideout etcthe execution is good but the script could be improved we already know they are superheroes and there are already prequels for each character so instead of taking lots of time talking out of their differences let these characters solve their differences in battle over battle before the final one lots of battle lots of actions awesomeness therefore my grin could last for days they also failed to explain why hulk can transform from an uncontrollable destroyer into a cooperative teammate in no time which feels like i miss some important scenesthe use of cgi  after several heavy cgi films  is starting to become dull its like the film maker has no other choice to awe audience than using bigger explosion more fatal destructions film like chronicles provide better use of cgi for enhancing the story while not as grande as this so overall i give it 6510 sorry for my english,fantasy
let me start by saying that i did in fact enjoy this movie however 8whatever is farrrrrrrrrr from accurate youre meaning to tell me this ranks up there with films like the godfather and shawshank redemption come on nowthere were some really good parts there were some almost unbelievably bad partsfirst 1020 min was like watching another flick entirely acting was up and down but overall it wasnt bad by any means dialogue was spotty but had some good lines and few laughs loads of cgi but the action was intense af so at the end of the day its entertaining i couldnt watch it 56 times but none the less entertainingnow for those who cant seem to understand how ratings work was it the best movie you have ever saw no ok dont rate it 1010 was it the worst movie you have ever saw no ok dont rate it 110 simple and for those expecting some original new fresh plot and amazingly moving dialogue seriously go somewhere else with that sht what could they have possibly done thats creative with superheros especially ones that have been around for 60 yearssorry ranting a bit conclusion if you like superhero movies you will likely enjoy this,fantasy
first off id like to say that the was a good movie however it was hyped up way too much and after reading some review online i think i know what my problem with it was a lot of people are calling the the antidark knight while i agree that these two movies are completely different they are easily compared and the dark knight wins by a mile i was never really into comic books but batman has one of my favorites anyway after seeing the my only favorite was iron man and only because of his own movie and of course robert downey jr but getting to the point the hardly had a plot it was by far the coolest movie i have seen a while but some of the things were just too annoying to get past first transformers 3 much next many people say that tom hiddleston was fantastic as loki maybe i wasnt watching the same movie because he seemed to act without motivation and indeed a bit shallowly before being defeated he reveals everything to the black widow one who has clearly revealed her ploy already for being a guy powerful enough to bring a massive army from another planet he and his army were sure beaten pretty easily also was anyone else perturbed by hulks sudden ability to control the other guy a stupid name to begin with at the end its details like these along with the lack of plot and themes that make me give this a 710 however still a very enjoyable film and i highly recommend seeing as long as you dont claim it an 88 or 30 on imdb,fantasy
ok glad to start doing reviews on imdb the what a movie seems to be the line on everybodys lips well i am going to say after seeing it both 3d and 2d that i can make an honest objective opinionthe special effects which whether you like it or not is one of the movies highlights yes they are good and nicely done but why the 3d why did i pay for a 3d movie where the 3d was never used in his pure awesomeness yes its cheesy and cheap to see boulders pieces of buildings tires arrows explosions and all sort of stuff flying towards you but its also fun  thats why you go to see it in 3d well let me tell you this movie has none of that no sir its just simple digital 3d shots of new york and other stuff nothing specialsad to see that after 34 years avatar still holds the crown it should give you an idea about thisacting is good all the way to great and yes tony stark robert downey jr steals the show which can be good if your a fan like me but can also be bad for the rest of the crew he is great the others are ok hulk is amazing but then again he is cgithe story and here is where it starts to get annoying guys some of these characters did not have theyre own movie so its hard to relate to them get to care for them especially when you wont have enough time to do soso why so much black widow then again why no drama no connections between them i honestly expected to see captain america fall for black widow as the comic books say still its the 1st part so there is time but makes you feel like you havent been treated with the whole cake but a cookiegoing to the action scene is where i get disappointed alien invasion where in the middle of new york with no real damage to the city what happened to the big booms and explosions where the hell was the army where were all those special weapons stark created for so long where the hell was war machine as the air force commander no sir here you will only see a bunch of cops fat ones also fighting alongside our 6 fellas to protect the city and the only idea the government has is to nuke the city 10 minutes after the invasion very original it was one of those sad moments in my life as a movie enthusiast where i actually did missed michael bay and his explosions and action scenes again you can make an idea about the war sceneending this review with my last disappointment i know i know ita a pg movie but please stop making it so if you going to loose every bit of drama left in the movie yes you wont see swearing in the movie or blood or naked women or at least people dying no no this is a kids movie with superheroes that is no where near as good as imdb score is now i felt cheated because my expectation for this movie were hugefinal conclusion both the new spiderman  batman are going to swipe the floor with this movie so please stop calling it the best superhero movie of the year,fantasy
i had been waiting for this movie for a long time but it wasnt what i expected i was a little bit disappointed the first hour was great but then the movie turned in a comedy movie and it wasnt taken seriously like the batman moviesloki was supposed to be much more powerful it was supposed that a team was needed to capture him but hulk just took him like a ragdoll by himself the aliens are supposed to be powerful but they die just with 1 gunshot i was waiting for the moment loki vs it never happened the just surrounded him and he surrenderedthe movie has very good special effects explosions etc but i expected something different i liked the movie but it could had been much better,fantasy
i went to the premiere quite apprehensive on several counts a will robert downey jr ever get back to the brilliance of iron man 1 or have cocky dialogs won over a cool plot b mark ruffalo as the hulk why not edward norton c hawkeye  not a superhero but just a guy with good aim black widow  no powers againis she just for eyecandy d will hemsworth get more screen time and a better plot than what thor offered him e loki the main villain  is this going to be yet another thor vs loki battle with the others just chipping in f will too many superheroes dilute the plot  will they be eating up each others screen time g is technology going to win against a good storyline once again ref all the other transformer films except the 1st h so many of themwill iron man hold fort in the teamhonestly i didnt even care for evans and captain america as much as i did for thor  iron man and i must say with the runtime being 145 minutes i wondered if it would be a dragthe verdictthe movie takes time to settle into the plot  setting up the characters unlike thor were i felt the movie just rushed through and could have been so much morethe film is larger than life unlike iron man 2 or captain america which left me wishing they had done moreloki does a great job of portraying the villain thor delivers black widow  hawkeye are manageable but nothing can compare to the fact that ruffalo actually fits this version of hulk way better than norton could have done and of course iron man rocks rocks like he never didby the time you reach the second half the story has built in enough punch to make you wish there was an epic battle to follow and not a lame effort and it does deliver great action lot of mayhem every superhero getting his screen timehulk  iron man indeed steal the show good dialogs  well timed comic quips here and therea perfect start to the 201213 tentpole league now if only the hobbit  dark knight rises keep up to this level its gonna be a great year ,fantasy
for those of you who are looking for more than just action sequences this is going to be a very long film for you my advice is visit the restroom as often as youd like dont torture yourselftake away the very predictable first 45 minutes of team assembly and the final 45 minutes of predictable onesided manoamano theres still 50 minutes in the middle to put together a decent story but when all is said and done youll find its impossible to describe what the movie was really about after all no one ever promised its a movie about anythingworry not though no one is ever going to ask you about the storyline your sole responsibility is to remember the details of the special effects eg how the smoke coming out of a broken rotating blade is sucked back into it abandoning that and youve just wasted a good chunk of your lifeso choose wisely if youre like me who can think of a million other ways to spend 25 hours of weekend time you probably should choose one of those instead,fantasy
when i was twelve i was so excited about the coming together after seeing ed norton in the incredible hulk and then iron man even captain america 1 chris evans was good in it i saw it once and was thinking this is it i saw it again and thought why the first half has lame jokes extremely boring fights and a whole twenty minutes dedicated to tony fixing a oversized fan the second half is even worse theres no depth in these characters once you see that the push by nick fury was fake and col son is alive so the come together over a lie which aggravated me so much one of the biggest gripes i havewhere is ed nortoni mean mark ruffalo was ok but seeing edward norton was the most exciting thing about the and then hes not even in it and the hulk looks like arnold schwarzanegger overdosing on steroids i cant stress enough how much hawkeye sucks he was a pawn for half the movie his character was dull and boring and then this movie is hailed as the best marvel movie ever what iron man the incredible hulk the goddamn spiderman movies marvel is just disappointing left and right and i love marvel the xmen and spiderman movies are the best ones and then the second was better but still lacked a lot of the things the first one was missing give marvel to talented directors gosh christopher nolan is already with dc so why not get talent like brad bird matthew vaughn danny boyle neil blomkamp just ugh no more joss wheddonthis movie just sucks,fantasy
loki is looking to unleash hell down on earth and make people bow at his feet nick fury is forced to assemble the worlds greatest superheroes in hopes of saving everyone the must put their egos aside to make everything right again and stop loki im hoping to see age of ultron later this week in preparation for it and to get myself more pumped i decided to watch the again for the fourth time this movie has almost everything you can possibly imagine ever wanted to see thor face off against the incredible hulk how about thor fighting iron man youll get that here and more if youre not fond of some of the superheroes in this movie there is plenty of others to choose from it really is a marvel fans wet dream its one thing to make great action its another to combine that great action with nearflawless storytelling joss whedon manages to pull this off this must have been an incredibly hard script to write whedon manages to deal with the pressure to give us a thoughtful script i loved how the first 30 minutes or so focuses on introducing each character i thought it was really neat how they delved into what everybody was going through at the time the action scenes may take your breath away im what you call an adrenaline junkie ive seen tons of action movies but there arent many that make my jaw drop like this one the last 40 minutes or so are filled with mind blowing action it rarely gives you a chance to breathe the performances are excellent these superheros may have incredible abilities but they have flaws the character development was superb robert downey is awesome as iron man his obnoxious behavior tests my patience but he is perfect for iron man captain america isnt my favorite by any means chris evans is great at playing him though he even manages to make him somewhat likable chris hemsworth is tremendous as thor mark ruffalo isnt the best hulk but he does a really good job nonetheless scarlett johansson was my favorite she has a lot of depth to her character her checkered past and reluctance to be a heroine made her character all the more interesting she also has some great fight scenes wait until you see the stunts when shes tied up in a chair tom hiddleston is amazing as loki he is so manipulative smarmy and i couldnt stand him if you hated loki in thor youll hate him even more here what a job samuel l jackson is the epitome of coolness jeremy renner is very good as hawkeye i wish theyd have delved into his struggle a bit more but i wont carp too much clark gregg cobie smulders skarsgard paltrow all do what they have to do well this movie is the closest thing to perfection i cant see marvel topping this this is one of my favorite movies of all time and it never fails to blow me away im so pumped for age of ultron1010,fantasy
the is a great movie and i think its because of what they wanted to do with this film in phase one of marvels cinematic universe and this movie pays off quicklythe action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just topnotch you already know what the plot is about so i dont have to go over it but i will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor the ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this filmrobert downey jr is great as iron man and he does get a lot of screen time chris evans plays captain america and he does an amazing job chris hemsworth and jeremy renner were both good as thor and hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters mark ruffalo was cool as bruce banner  the hulk and he does motion capture for the hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero scarlett johannson plays black widow  natasha romanoff and she could not done better in this film but the one person who really was great is tom hiddleston as loki thors brother and he makes a good villain james spader is gonna do better as the title character ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 marvel studios film age of ultron which will be released this friday on may 1st 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as ultronaaron taylorjohnson is going to rock as quicksilver but i think mary kate and ashley olsens sister elizabeth is hot as scarlet witch and shes gonna do great in that part but samuel l jackson as nick fury is good in the screen time he has in this film but he only has a cameo or small part in the new movie which i will review on friday may 1st 2015 and i think its going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie seasonthe visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie especially the hulk in this film the music by alan silvestri is fantastic and amazing i could not believe the music that i heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it the films running time feels like its three hours long but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long so the movie moves on very quicklyoverall i love the and i am giving it an 8  10 marvel has outdone themselves with this film and they will continue to outdo themselves with other future marvel movies and its not like every day that a fouryear plan pays off with such praise and hype but this paid off wonderfully,fantasy
okay is good the dialogue is witty and the action is action not a movie so much around telling a story as it is telling jokes i like that style but going by the director joss whedons quote make it dark make it grim make it tough but for the love of god tell a joke well you got that last part right but wheres the build up and im not talking about the boring beginningi guess i just feel like the characters got to wisecrack each other but they didnt really demonstrate that they got each other i feel like im missing something we didnt get that one moment that was serious something that i feel like joss said himself was important to the build upas i said i find the beginning to be rather boring it doesnt grab me with a defining character moment i dont feel like is one of the great movies i dont even feel like its the best of the series they did better in the winter soldier they did a better ensemble in guardians of the galaxy it wasnt as passionate as spiderman 2 it doesnt compare to the writing of the dark knightthey built up to this film with five other character flicks which i guess is the reason why this works i just feel like something more meaningful could been done i feel like we could have seen how the characters relate to each other guardians of the galaxy could be accused of having the same problem but i feel like they at least joked about relating doesnt do that hawkeye is there and he does nothing iron man attempts a sacrifice and we dont feel much cap is there and he doesnt offer as much american spirit as he could thor has some good remarks black widow is hot and badass and if there is something i like about life its a badass hot femalewhat im doing at the end of the day is nitpicking i mean what i say about this film but it is fun it is a good comedy dont let a couple flaws distract from this i actually feel like in some ways this film was a build up we have them all together and they know each other so perhaps they can accomplish more in the age of ultron,fantasy
im not exactly sure i get the hype but this movie felt pretty sub par im not an extremist that think films should have a cult format i do enjoy big production though blockbusters have seen better days they basically put together some comic book heroes of some sort and tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for having them all participate in the newest worldnew york savingnot a good idea the rushed pace to make every character fit the length is easily noticed im no superhere expertquite the opposite but im pretty sure scarlett johanssons past doesnt involve two parents made of stone so id argue her acting is not at its finestnot that the script helps hollywood makes amazing stuff but its stigma of being shallow focused on silliness can be entirely summarized in this particular movie the cheesy lines aiming for climatic humor the grand scale explosions lots of known names in the cast nothing really stand out because nothing has sufficient time to shine everything feels crampeddestruction on this scale demands a villain with capital v loki is never that guy with the exception of a scene that turned out to be faked with johansson he never looks threatening its hard to tell where everyone came about as well as loki himself because every few minutes a new superhero pop up on screenthe biggest problem in having that many unworldly people together is the fact that everyone comes from different imaginary worlds hulk seems to be the top dude on the street while thor is portrayed as a god theres also a guy that shoots arrows scarlets character also seems to have a gymnastlike elasticity and a way too harsh personality for having just that the desperate attempt to make everyones role slightly equal is absurdthe effect are topnotch after all expected from a blockbuster of this magnitude this might appeal to hardcore fans of comics but i cant see how anyone would enjoy it beyond that at being a dumb action movie it does a pretty awful job,fantasy
the ironman captain america thor the hulk black widow and hawkeye have come together on the big screennow before you watch the its important that you watch ironman ironman 2 the incredible hulk 2008 thor and captain america the first avenger so you could understand and follow the story line that plays out in the since the five movies i just named play into thethe plot centers around loki played by tom hiddleston looking to raise a army with the power of the tesseract once he takes it into his hands this leads shield director played by samuel l jackson along with agents phil coulson played by clark gregg and maria hill played by cobie smulders to enlist the help of the with captain america played by chris evans ironman played by robert downey jr thor played by chris hemsworth bruce banner hulk played by mark ruffalo natasha romanoffblack widow played by scarlett johansson and clint bartonhawkeye played by jeremy rennerbut things dont go exactly as fury hoped as ego and pride begins to take hold of the teamnow to be honest with you it took me two watches before i could give it a better appreciation because normally when you have a lot of characters from different movies in one crossover it doesnt take one watch to understand it all since you have them in one filmbut now that i have watched it quite a few times i have to say the film did a very good job with giving each character equal screen time as well as their own scenes before they would have to be introduce together for the rest of the filmmany fans of marvel will be happy to see their favorite heroes united into one film which is not something you see everyday and it is well appreciatedand i like how the film choose loki to be the main antagonist and when you see the film you will understand fully since loki is thors brother it helps the plot and story of the filmthe action in the is very well thought and well done with each hero getting their own spot at making it big on the film it goes to show what imagination and lot of luck will do for you if you take the timethe plot in the film is very good as well with strong performances by each actor who wanted to make sure the got the respect it deserved so good job everyonethe music also is very good and each score in the film tells the story of the scene in the film so very good work on the music for the filmwith everything the has going for it it is worth noting that some things could have been better but overall nothing too much to complain aboutmany fans have been waiting for this crossover for some time and they wont be disappointed with thor hulk captain america and ironman all joining forces for the big screen so marvel delivers pretty well on this oneoverall the is a well deserved movie for marvel fans and doesnt let down the fans what so ever if youre looking for a good comic book movie with many legends this is your filmi give the an 8 out of 10,fantasy
in a late scene hulk beats the daylight out of the one credible supervillain in the film  loki  and you realize having a team of superheroes  even one that spends a lot of time bickering  does tend to unbalance the scales of justice to the home team the superheroes also include an indestructible beast  the aforementioned hulk  and an immortal god  thor like the old jerry seinfeld line about superman  why would he needs the rest of the superfriends  hes superman why do you need for example hawkeye  essentially katniss everdeen with piercing blue eyes  or black widow whose superpower seems to be looking good in leather this leaves robert downey jrs ironman who by contractual arrangement with the 25m a picture actor gets all the good lines two in particular when he calls out an extra for playing galaga and refers to thor as point break are instant film classics unfortunately whedon like the rest of us is slave to rdjs ego so hes left to give just dull exposition dialog to the boring and largely obsolete captain america theres only one god and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that and onenote samuel l jackson hey you guys we need to fight back having said all that although a little talky the film presents expensivelooking prolonged and noisy cgi action sequences which distract if not entertain the movie understands its nerdy male audience by lingering on the backsides of the female characters whenever they exit the shot for a meaningful but not creepy length of time gweneth paltrow runs with this trope by only achieving ambulatory movement by strutting at all times an excellent cast actors fees only must have hit the 100m mark also contributes to a worthwhile outing in short this confused story of overwhelming good versus one overcompensating pasty evil younger brother with bad hair staring at for its 2 12 hour run time,fantasy
dont get me wrong i liked iron man the incredible hulk and captain america the first avenger iron man 2 and thor were disappointing in my opinion but i was still anxiously awaiting the now after having watched a couple of times i can soundly say that the is a disappointmentwhile the isnt all bad it fails in many departments for starters loki is a terrible villain he never felt like a threat and neither did the chitauri army which appears in the films final act without explanation there is lack of suspense and the film suffers as a resultmeanwhile the plot is also contrived and clichd the death of agent coulson kind of fails to evoke any emotion as he isnt fully developed as a character for some strange reason mark ruffalos bruce banner can now control his powers for the sake of the story the main heroes fight among themselves before finally realizing that theyre all being selfish the story here is nothing more than the good guys versus the bad guys something that has been seen countless times beforethe performances meanwhile are passable but not commendable robert downey jr has the pleasure of saying some of the films best lines but at times it feels like the movie revolves around him mark ruffalo does an okay job as bruce banner but i dare say that i wouldve preferred edward norton meanwhile the two chrises do the best with what their given compared to scarlett johansson who merely serves as eye candy and jeremy renner who is largely forgotten as hawkeyethe movie ends with the same actionpacked explosionfest that has ended so many past hollywood blockbusters yet despite the caliber of the people involved with the the finale feels like something out of the transformers movies which isnt really a comparison to be proud ofall in all the is a disappointing entry in the marvel cinematic universe although it offers some witty dialogue every now and then along with the occasionally exciting action sequence it is bogged down by clichd storytelling and a remarkably weak villain considering this film cost 225 million it couldve been much better510,fantasy
its like marvel comics heaven i am seeing characters i have not seen since childhood capt america and thor and some i have never seen black widow hawkeye there are favorites like iron man and the hulk toothey are all there in an action packed adventure that challenges the eye and the earwriterdirector josh whedon brought his consider experience creating strong women buffy in his creation of the black widow played by scarlett johansson and we have robert downey to thank for making sure we get to see pepper potts gwyneth paltrow in the film seeing gwyneth is always a treatbrilliant action film,fantasy
i did not envy the mammoth task that joss whedon had in front of him some seriously good characters had been developed in some very impressive comic book films already so he had to tread very carefully in order to not destroy what had been carefully created he then had to bring them all together into one film and make sure that they all had a purpose and that one did not outshine the otherso did it work well the answer is yes beyond anything we could have expected toookay the plot is not original in anyway and it was fairly predictable but i wasnt going to see the usual suspects after all what do comic characters do they fight bad guys and save the world and that is exactly what we get what really surprised me is how some of the characters that only had minor roles in the previous films rose to the occasion and held their own the black widow and hawkeye really played their part which before i had seen it i was sceptical about captain america never really over impressed me in his own outing he was good but thats it in this he shone through becoming a vital leadership role coordinating the throughout the end battle thor did his bit probably the only character that didnt bring us anything special loki was outstanding clever funny and likable something that bruce banner amusingly points out of coarse iron man steels the show did we expect anything less from downey jnr however a close match was the hulk who delivers some of the best moments in the filmthe end battle is everything you expect it to be and if you are seeing it in 3d you are in for a real treat the humour is absolutely spot on what whedon does best with all of the characters no matter what world they are from they are very human in nature which i think is the biggest key to the success of the marvel comic book films everyone has a sense of humour and through major life threatening situations they still keep it nobody is too seriousthere are a few people that feel they have to go against the norm and put a film like this down maybe they feel that by becoming a simon cowell and are very hard to please that makes them feel powerful and respected but the truth is that it is very sad that people behave like this the bottom line is that all films are really supposed to be is entertainment if you want to cry you go see the green mile if you want to laugh you go see american pie if you want gore you see hostel and if you want to see blockbuster action you go see assemblea film should be taken for what it is and if you go see this film for oscar winning performances and clever plot twists then im afraid you will be extremely disappointed and quite frankly you should keep your opinions to yourselves people are relying more and more on reviews to decide whether they should bother to go and see something and a good film reviewer should be flexible enough to see through the eyes of the audience it is aiming forignore the bad reviews if its big scale action with vibrant characters and great humour you are after then you cannot miss this gem the last time i was buzzing like this after a film was when i saw jurassic park on the big screen for the first time when i was 13 years old bring on the sequel,fantasy
marvels the is a 2012 american superhero film produced by marvel studios the beginning of the movie focuses on the rebuilding of the team in the nick fury director of the peacekeeping organization shield recruits iron man captain america the hulk and thor to form a team that must stop thors adoptive brother loki from overpowering earth loki with his long and flowing hair had teamed up with the alien race together they tried to steal the tesseract which in turn could destroy the world captain america was the first to be introduced he started in world war ii and was awoken in 2011he was the first member of the team each member of the team had a unique characteristic the hulk had enormous strength captain america in bravery iron mans had ability to fly thors unbearable hammer black widow in sexiness and hawkeyes unbeatable arrows the biggest challenge happened in the beginning of the movie when the had to face each other the argument of how to approach loki turned the members away from each other whedon the director forced his heroes against one another to get them to bond this movie was mainly classified as action and adventurethe hulk played a huge role in the making of this film having lived his life previously to fighting and not having the ability to control his body he moved to india with the thought that he would be able to live a normal life bruce banner was happy with his decision unfortunately the needed him to become the hulk again now not only does he have to deal with his anger management problem but also with depression and selfhatred overall the movie was well put together between the graphics and the 3d realization one would feel to play a part in this movie although the 220 million dollar film had a plot line that will leave viewers breathless it could also be confusing to others since it is a continuation some people who havent seen the previous five movies or know the storyline of the could get lost however whedon does an excellent job at trying to catch new viewers up will the recover from lost time and defeat loki or will the earth be destroyed from the comic books to live film the is an excellent movie for all ages,fantasy
this movie my favorite i am glad that spiderman isnt in it my favorites are hulk and iron man the special effects are cool and its a neverbefore seen movie the rocks thor is the one that really takes action captain america is there leader iron man trys his best to avenge hulk and hawkeye are making things all blown up and black widow is shooting and hitting this is one good movie do watch it if you want a good movie i also say its the big huge fantastic cool blast of the year now would be a good time to go to the theater and enjoy the includes cool powers special effects and its a big blast,fantasy
i was reluctant to go to see this film i thought the latest batman film would be better it was pantshowever apart from being a cinematic treat the story entertained toothe film was a veritable plethora of a list actors and the action was unceasingtruly a great filmespecially with whatsherface in the tight gearsunfortunately the review guidelines require 10 lines all i can say is what a ing pain that was fucking btw,fantasy
i dont usually comment on a film for which im completely neutral but this film deserves a neutral comment as its such a waste of time and money it exhibits the typical american obsession with violence and little or no character development after fastforwarding through all the crash bang wallop scenes and still keeping track of the plot i still didnt care what happened to anyone including the planetscarlet johansson is completely miscast as the black widow she should be tall and willowy mark ruffalo is perfectly cast as the hulk as it suits his style of acting which is usually dumbi really am a fan of joss whedon and own the entire buffy collection but i counted two  maybe three  snappy lines of dialogue in this very disappointingi was going to give it 5 out of 10 but decided it deserved 6 towards the end  barely just too corny for words and silly in the extreme,fantasy
the theatre in the town where i live isnt exactly pleasant so i decided to wait until the came out on dvd to buy it now understand i am a huge marvel fan  ive seen all the preludes ive read comics ive watched cartoons i had the action figures as a kid this movie meant a ton to me and i was hoping it would be great and as i pressed play and the villain loki appeared i knew i was in for an eventthe exceeded my expectations by far cementing it as one of my favourite movies of all time instantly you could say that im shallow  that the is nothing more than a cg extravaganza that pales against the likes of the dark knight but youre wrongthe has a heart that other superhero movies or even other movies dont its funnier than most comedies ive seen it succeeds in not taking itself so deathly seriously that it loses what makes a superhero movie a superhero movie  it relishes the implausibility of whats happening at the same time however its technically fantastic its wellacted the characters are wellfleshed out likable and receive a lot of development and joss whedon expertly juggles every single hero marvel threw at him everyone feels like they belong on the team even black widow  who i was worried was going to be the female character ended up being a standout in the movie the dialogue is fantastic and i was very impressed with the pace even when the team was on the helicarrier for quite a while i was completely engrossedat one point i stepped back from the extreme battle going on and i realized that i was smiling during the entire movie up until thenabsolutely fantastic 1010,fantasy
i was anticipating this film so much i am not one to rush to see a film the day of release as id rather watch it alone in an empty cinema a few bated weeks past and i decided it was time to see the film everyone was describing as the best film they had ever seen unlikely i began to watch the film in an almost empty cinema and found myself bored i laughed at parts that were not meant to be laughed at and the supposed comedy just left me confused i made a decision and walked out of the film half way through unsure as to whether the huge hype had just made the film a complete letdown i decided to give it another chance when it was released on dvd i realised where the film had gone wrong as a marvel fan i knew the back story the characters and previous movie plots however the failed to explain any of this no character development what so ever and although i was aware of the story i found myself having to wrack my brain to remember things from the comics the film is just another generic superhero movie nothing new nothing special i realise this is an unconventional view but i feel that a lot of people would have enjoyed it because they felt they had to i guess die hard marvel fans couldnt claim to dislike the biggest superhero film of all time ,fantasy
saw that movie only a week or two it came out waiting for my friend to go to the mall with and it was is  amazing i was never a superhero fan but the blew me away with black widows kick butt moves tonys constant sarcasm and spoiler alert if you havent seen the movie dont go on thor and captain america little battle over who understands 21st century phrases its entirely amazing if you take all that away you still have the plot line and action honestly if you havent i really recommend you to see this movie when it comes out if you liked the before they hit the big screen youre gonna go hay wire now,fantasy
this was a highly anticipated title for me and may be for everyone else as well but when i actually saw this movie i dont think this movie deserves this type of rating its so much over ratedi dont mean this move is bad the movie is good but so over rated and you will only find kids stuff in there i think this one is really made for little kids dont watch this movie expecting something like iron man 2 or thor it is not very well written and the plot is not very strong not a serious movie i think having this type of budged and all the great actors is such a waste and i believe only the kids have rated it so highif you want to enjoy this movie then do not expect anything like iron man or thor you will be disappointed if you will have those expectationsthe major issue with this movie is its script and weak plot the antagonist is incredibly cheap and stupid as well they could have used some better ideas although there are a lot of special effects and a lot of actions which is good but it just do not fits it to an 8 it is an average movie which deserves something 610 so dont believe the hypethank you khurram saeed,fantasy
one of the best super hero movies i have seen but it is only that it isnt supposed to have any deeper meaning or advanced plot this is a movie mainly for comic fans im not much of a comic reader but i still enjoyed itthere was a couple of things i couldnt quite ignore though i thought the invasion was pretty terrible the aliens sent in only a couple of worm things that contained a few alien cgi soldiers and bumped into a couple of buildings it was not exactly an effective way to take earth the second thing that kind of annoyed me was the aliens just to keep it pg13 there is no gore and the aliens are nothing but cgi bad guysi was worried there wouldnt be enough screen time for each of the super heroes considering there were so many but i was pleasantly surprised to see that they all had their roles and input what really annoyed me though was cobie smulders what an unnecessary character to throw into the movie she did nothing of importance at all i dont know if cobies character is in the comics but its still just annoying to see her on screen its just a cheap business trick to have more stars in the movie and of course adding a fine movie to her resume every time she was on screen it just reminded me that the film industry is just a business like everything elseid give it 80,fantasy
this is basically a movie thats here for a purpose as a viewer youll certainly have some fun even though the movie is too long for my taste it should be 20 min less in duration especially at the beginning where all the unnecessary dialog is taking place other purpose is for a hollywood to make a quick buck  you have all the well known characters from their previous movies that are just here in one place all together screenplay is weak as well as the basic idea and main villain if you can kill those aliens with guns and arrows you dont really need super heroes now do you and the final and maybe he most important purpose is to make more cash for the upcoming movies that will feature all of these characters individually well known hollywood formula milk the cash as long as you can,fantasy
it is quite unfortunate that after iron man and the incredible hulk the marvel films switched from being serious films to complete jokes i was expecting the to be a really bad film however instead of being painful to watch like iron man 2 captain america and thor the is really entertaining as a wholeit is certainly an interesting film it is sort of like the movie machete except much better it has a bmovie feel to it but is extremely entertaining the villain is so clich it is hysterical part of what really makes this movie shine is the horrible acting and dialogue by several of the actors and actresses the three worst actors in the movie are loki the villain played by tom hiddleston nick fury played by samuel jackson and agent maria hill played by colbie smulderswhile the idea of watching a movie with horrible dialogue may not be appealing to some there is another side to the movie that works well in an admirable fashion and that is the super heroes particularly iron man the hulk and captain america these actors really add some emotion and movie star pizazz to the movie in the same way that liam neeson did for the phantom menace which is probably the worst movie of all time the effects and action scenes are all top notch though some of the action scenes with the black cat and hawkeye are a little unconvincing considering they are just normal humans with no super powers or technologynonetheless it is fun to also see robert downey jr make fun of the campiness and unbelievable other,fantasy
the has been one of the most anticipated movies of the year arguably of the decade when so many super heroes are in one movie the fans and nerds will flock and thats what they did i would say that it did not disappoint mostly looking back on the experience i have to say that the quality of the was surprisingly poor the acting really didnt stand out with the exception of guess who robert downey jr completely overshadowing the rest of the cast the dialogue much like the acting was really skimpy most of the general conversation felt like it needed more time spent on it and it seems most of the work went into the multitude of witty jokes that actually ended up working in their favorthe story much like the dialogue felt familiar and at many times i couldnt help but feel a sense of deja vu in the plot twists and the action scenes the pacing in the story was also off and in between the intense and exciting action sequences i felt bored of the cheap although sometimes hilarious dialoguethe characters were actually quite shallow individual character development was pretty much nonexistent with the movie focusing more on the relationships between the characters and even that was shallowhowever all of this aside the was actually a good movie the plain fact is that this movie is absolutely everything that fans wanted and with that was able to bury most of the problems it had under romping good fun something that many other movies have tried and failed to do the hulk smashed iron man blew stuff up captain america bashed the badies etc if there was any analogy to describe the it would be that it is like ufc its kinda cheesy and doesnt take itself too seriously however when the good guy slams the bad guy everybody cheers when hulk smashed the crowd erupted when loki says some snide comment there was booing and hissing the was not a good film it was merely an exhibition of the superheroes power and that was exactly what the fans came to see and i can appreciate that,fantasy

let me just cut straight to the main point joss whedon has made the impossible work not only has he made it work but work well marvel assemble is just as good as the hype would have it though fails to surpass itto avoid confusion this is the same film released in the us which is titled marvels the but has been renamed in the uk to avoid any confusion with the classic 60s television series the despite its awkward title ill refer to it as fulfils its very goal in bringing together the characters of the marvel cinematic universe and making an incredibly entertaining action movie the greatest challenge of this film no doubt was bringing these characters together and giving them all a fair amount of screen time whilst trying to make their relationships work not only does director joss whedon do this but he manages to include a nice level of believable character development and emotion to a film that is first and foremost and action movie whilst the action scenes were undoubtedly entertaining it was in the films smaller moments in which the characters share the screen particularly the chemistry between tony stark and bruce banner that make the film such a success when these characters have their individual movies they are learning how to deal with their personal problems in this movie they are learning how to deal with working together as a team this being the main purpose of the film it really is a marvel sorry that whedon has managed to make this work let alone being as entertaining as it is the film packs in humour emotion and tension without becoming a clustered messthe special effects were all impressive especially on the motioncapture used to create the hulk and the iron man armour the final battle did admittedly remind me of transformers 3 but unlike that film this never regresses into chaos and the film feels very incontrol of itself and you always know exactly what is going on the action itself is nothing special but its watching these characters work together as a team that is so much fun the film is a little biased towards iron man action containing more iron man than the last two iron man movies put together but fear not this is a good thingperformance wise all performances were on top form even from scarlet johansen who has vastly improved her blackwidow character from the wooden acting we saw in iron man 2 for me the standout performances were from tom hiddleston as loki and mark ruffalo as bruce banner hulk i was initially biased against replacing edward norton as bruce banner but can safely say ruffalo is the best bruce banner we have seen to date and i love the fact that ruffalo did his own motioncaptured performance as hulk tom hiddleston steals every scene as the villainous loki evolving his character from the lost prince of asgard we saw in thor into an utterly unstoppable and menacing force of hatredunfortunately just making a film work well doesnt raise it to instant classic status but what is really incredible about is how utterly flawless it is theres nothing particularly special about the film but its just fantastic watching these characters share the same screen when appreciated for what it is is an entertaining ride not taking itself too seriously whilst focusing on thrills and fun incorporating emotion and character development into the mix i look forward to rewatching it,fantasy
this movie is getting immensely good reviews universal critical acclaim id hate to be the sore thumb standing out giving the movie an average review or what sounds belowaverage compared to all the other reviews but i was having a hard time enjoying this movie part of the problem was an overwhelmingly distracting midnightpremiere audience i liked it better the second time a few weeks later when the theater was much less attended but not a whole lot because of reasons ill explain nextthough this is a combination superhero movie the idea of which i really like and though its likable how the interactions between the heroes was important i wasnt so completely sure the relationships between the heroes was very believable sometimes it seemed so but not really i expected there to be more time devoted to the heroes getting to know each other as if they were actually unaware of each other before the start of the movie but instead they all knew each other pretty well pretty early it seemed the heroes showed a little less respect to each other than they probably should have in fact in several parts heroes got into fights with each other which i really dont like seeing in the movies i would have liked to see captain america my personal favorite of the heroes in more of a leadership role than what he was given but would the captains shield forged by mortal muggles back in the 1940s really be able to deflect iron mans or lokis power beams which is maybe just a minor complaint speaking of loki he and his brother are back from thor and loki seemed to stand out a little more as a good villain than he did in thor but then there is the awkward situation that those characters as gods or demigods or whatever you call them contribute to the story this combination superhero movie makes the point that a team of superheroes can do more than what one superhero could do by himself but because loki a god was the main bad guy i spent most of the movie believing that thor also a god would have been the only hero capable of stopping lokii would also have liked to see more of the supporting characters from the pre movies show up in this movie erik selvig from thor and pepper potts from iron man were good showing up and it had to have been hard bringing back most or all of the captain america characters what with them being from the 1940s but i wish we could have seen don cheadle or terrence howard as rhodey from the iron man movies william hurt as general ross from the incredible hulk anthony hopkins as odin from thor or the heroes girlfriends liv tyler as betty ross from the incredible hulk natalie portman as jane foster from thor or hayley atwell as peggy carter from captain america pictures of jane and peggy both appeared briefly so that was okay the existing supporting characters were good for the most part particularly nick fury and phil coulson though i dont know how nick furys apparent lack of superpowers puts him in a rightful place to lead shield or a team of superheroes but i also have to say it was awkward that natasha romanoff black widow and clint barton hawkeye were on the team though romanoff is pretty good at spying and kicking butt shes not a superhero im sure that some showbiz news story reported back in 2009 or so that black widow would be a villain alongside whiplash in iron man 2 but it was a disappointment to me watching iron man 2 that she never turned out to be a villain shes still not a villain in the her name natalie rushman as used in iron man 2 seems to be completely fake and her name black widow was used a couple times in the which was infinitely more than the number of times it was used in iron man 2 and why is she called black widow shes not africanamerican she doesnt have a dead husband that i know of and she was never bitten by a radioactive spider hawkeye doesnt have any interesting or significant name either and his superpower is nothing more than notable skill in using a bow and arrow and though he appeared briefly in thor which i didnt notice the first time i watched it i couldnt tell how his involvement made the movie much more interesting so describe this movie as being about four superheroes not five or six or seven one supervillain a supervillains army of evil baddies and four muggle supporting heroes maybe im just not familiar with the comic books these characters are based on and maybe im just overthinking this a little too muchon the other hand the action was marvelous and if i was to judge this movie entirely by its action it would be the best or almost best action movie ever made while still sitting in the theater my first time i was a little bothered by how pessimistic about this i seemed to be but walking out of the theater i felt a little more optimistic that im sure ill like this more when i see it more times,fantasy
couldnt stop laughing for its witty humor the whole cineplex was just quivering with the clapping sound in each flash of action p though the starting with introduction part was a bit shaky quick entrance of superhero conflict action just swabbed that flaw p initially iron man dominated over the screen but hulk utterly stole the show after his unleash p hes always angry and thats the little secret of him p his wrathful countenance furious attitude broad grin turbulent smash and punch the way he thrashed loki repeatedlyahaaaaaaa  beside the appearance of hulk and iron man other heroes of seemed as only some effective sidekicks loki was well enough to trouble all with his villainy specialeffects and action sequence demand applause desiring keenly for its sequel ,fantasy
the is a good film and a never done before movie of an assembly of heroesnothing like the batman trilogies it is a good enjoyable film that is clever of how the heroes struggle to work together and end up helping each other towards the conclusion of the filmthe film is very well done until the end of the film that is pretty upsetting of how iron man was the only one who ends up saving the day and how the hulk is made to quickly end loki villain by just slamming him on the ground the problem also was where iron man was dead and the hulk quickly revives him by just slamming the ground and roaring and that is how iron man is savedthat was probably the most upsetting endings to a goo film but a horrible ending and a film that i was truly looking forward to that made me upset and angry not to expect great from the next that is the rumours,fantasy
there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people so when we needed them they could fight the battles that we never could after the god loki finds his way to earth steals the powerful tesseract and is close to fulfilling his goal of destroying the planet there is only one group that can stop him after years of recruiting nick furys jackson team is ready this is a movie that people will pretty much just watch without any prompting or reading reviews because of the hype and build up but ill do one anyway i have to start by saying that i never was a huge comic book movie person when they first started being made it was pretty much just how much stuff can we explode and how cool can we make it look over the years they have been getting better and better and i think the success of the batman movies by christopher nolan has raised the bar he has shown that a real story plot and great acting can make a typical popcorn movie into a legitimate movie all the years of honing the genre have led to this not only is this a fun movie to watch but it is also a great acted movie and everyone is perfectly cast downey is the leader but is in no way overpowering and this has the feel of a real ensemble cast movie in the way that crash did after years of movies like the fantastic 4 and spiderman they finally realized the key to not just making a good comic book movie but a great movie period good acting and writing are needed both are on display here i have said for years that i am not a comic book movie fanthis movie may have changed my mind overall not just a good and fun comic book movie but a good a fun movieperiod i give it an a,fantasy
the was exactly what i thought it would be loud funny actionfilled and fun it was a blast watching all of the superheroes weve come to know so well fight together and with each other hulk vs thor yes please the hulk definitely stole the show in an awesome way you probably wont blink once during the actionfight scenes you wouldnt want to miss anything all the greatness being saidthere just could have been a little bit more to the story all the fighting and loud noises distract you that there isnt too much of a story going on other than teamup and save the world from an alien race we dont know much about this is where i think i have been spoiled by the dark knight the dark knight set the bar for storytelling for superhero movies it was deep and really touched a nerve if you cut it it would bleed i also wanted hawkeye to play a bigger part all of that being said you get what you expect from watching the a really good time where you dont have to think too hard to really appreciate it,fantasy
the what to say what to say that the millions of other people havent said already i know exactly what they already said i really enjoyed the im not a big fan of allout action films but this one impressed me it tied all the characters well and provided a few laughs the action wasnt over the top but there wasnt too little of it either as you would expect from this genre of filmthe directing and cinematography were very good and the acting was great from everyone especially downey who is wooing me into liking him because i usually dont like his films but as of late hes been some good ones any fan of superhero or action should defiantly watch this film,fantasy
i wish there were 20 or 30 more of these movies its really fun to watch superheros interact especially when their back stories are so well done via previous movies other reviewers are correct saying that these actors are choice to play these characters my only complaint is that hey  the super villain loki was never really very threatening he was always a sort of weakling in thor though interesting in this movie his only trick is tapping a cane against your chest to control your mind and being a ruthless jerk i guess scary practically speaking but its not an equal match to four or five movies worth of enemies that we already know the good guys can chew through individually the bad guy aliens came through the hole in the sky at a rate of about 1 every 3 seconds kind of trickled through id say we didnt even need the to dispatch those flying motorcycles  the us air force could have handled this whole bunch pretty neatly though ny would have suffered a bit more so then why were the necessary i dunno it just seems like the big terrible event that had everyone so worried wasnt that bad i want a really really scary threat like the new spider man has to defeat not some whiny loser like loki,fantasy
now im always getting a ton of hate for my opinion on the so im prepared for many people to disagree with me to start off i am a huge marvel fan have been since i was young so im not someone going in without a clue is a solid superhero movie with superb acting from much of the cast its fairly unanimous ruffalo and downey jr stole the show great visuals and terrific action choreography but i still believe it to be overrated and that is when people jump out at me im not saying its a bad film i definitely enjoyed the viewing especially in theatre i couldnt really see myself caring to see it again though not to say i would never i just dont have a strong urge to i am still excited for the sequel theres no doubt about that it will most likely be more of the same and enjoyable the thing about and all of the other marvel studios productions thor captain america iron man series is that i dont feel they do what christopher nolans batman series has accomplished  and that is transcend the superhero genre there is so much emotion and depth to both batman begins and even more so the dark knight that could not even hold a candle to them i suppose you could argue that would be due to the fact that the source material might be better for the batman films but i still feel the overall atmosphere of the marvel studios movies are less character development more poppy in your face action sequences and quirky one liners again that is not to say that is a terrible thing it just doesnt bring or any of the others up past good for me they do not reach great some people argue that the character development is great and although i will agree that its much better in the than any of the other marvel films  because it had to be  it still doesnt reach compelling to me just entertaining,fantasy
heres a simple fun wellmade summer movie its not great by any measure nor does it ever try to be what it does have is a director who understands that the source material is essentially comic book fluff none of these characters have the depth that batman or the xmen do but they do have cool powers and cool personalities that make for a decent story and some great action set piecesthe most epic of these sequences takes place in  youll never guess never not in a milllion years  new york city while the scene lacks originality in location it does make up for it in sheer excitement iron man goes rocketing around town in spectacular aerial battles with the chitauri who are as disposable as the foot soldiers from teenage mutant ninja turtles hawkeye sits on a perch on top of a building and casually snipes more chitauri out of the air with his bow and arrow the hulk well he smashes his chaotic leaping and random crushing of the puny aliens is spectacular to watch oh and a few of our good guys end up battling loki at random points as wellgo to httpthethreeactswordpresscom20120511the to read the complete review,fantasy
i am really disappointed by imdb it cannot be that a movie is rated with 9 before it actually goes to the screen i did not want to watch this movie when i saw the trailer unfortunately i read reviews and got misled by this high rating on imdb i expected much but i got an average action movie the movie was not entertaining by profoundness it was an 2 12 hour orgy of visual fireworks this may be awesome for under aged persons but this definitely is not satisfying an audience that wants a story good character description and most important a movie which is not completely foreseeableimdb should consider that their rating system lacks crucial information about the age of the reviewers i give 6 of 10 because the visual effects were great but thats not what defines a good movie,fantasy
i didnt think this movie would live up to the expectations that surrounded it but luckily it did whoever hasnt seen this movie yet what the heck are you waiting for this is a great movie for comic book fans kids and anyone who loves some good ol action i really didnt think this movie wouldvee been as good as it was without iron man hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america so i loved everything about this movieacting action plot special effects the only problem i personally had was just that hulk wasnt in it as much as i wanted but when he was there it was just epic also that the hulk really reminded me of a a gorilla at the end of the movie which i found just funny but other than that i can ignore the fact that odin just sent thor to earth the chintari just dying after the mother ship blew up and the excessive comedic relief i found it quite strange that the world was in danger of being taken over and all the characters took it so lightly and making jokes but still this movie was just awesome 1010 best movie this year,fantasy
this movie is a lot better than i expected at first when i heard that they were making this movie i was quite exited as i love super hero sort of movies i thought that this movie would probably be like other marvel movies where they had a load of talking at the start and then the action comes in a bit later but unexpectedly this movie got on with the action straight away i loved this movie it is truly one of this years must see films because it had breathtaking effects with a really funny side to it alsoif i were to recommend this to anyone it would probably be every one who likes these sort of movies with all the characters coming together to make one massive blockbuster seems like they did it this would have to be one of the best films of the year and is a must see for any marvel hero fan i saw this movie in imax and it was awesome,fantasy
i was quite worried about the early trailers and storyline behind this film after continuing a story line based on the cube in the movie captain america first avenger which was an atrocious movie i was also worried about the casting of captain america i was afraid that he would ruin the entire movie for me if he wasnt given good lines and action sequences but i had faith in joss whedon having been a fan of the firefly i believed if anyone could make the it would be himand he did the movie was a complete both in pleasing the viewers and the an earning millions of dollars profit already it has beaten harry potter dh part 2 and avatar in both opening nights and weekends and box office records alright now to the movie itself the acting was fabulous in most parts robert downey doing showing us once again what a great choice it was to cast him as ironman delivering hilarious lies and portraying tony stark brilliantly chris hemsworth loved him not much credit goes to this young star but i think he does thor brilliantly mark ruffalo was great as the roll of bruce banner though i probably prefer ed norton the lines were specifically chosen to fit mark ruffalothanks to joss whedon the hulk itself was quite cool though at parts looked fake was a good cgi impersonation of mark ruffalo the hulk was sensational character and hilarious at parts as well tom hiddleston the villain loki was sensational as well he was a well crafted villain from the start though i wish at some parts they made more of a confident bad guy who feared nothing rather than a crazy villain at parts chris evans finally came into the roll of captain america due to good lines and development of his character the other characters fitted in there part not overly special though ok fight scenes wonderfully crafted and directed hulk vs thor was an epic fight scene which it should have been having the two most powerful marvel characters in a fight against each other the thor vs ironman was very good except that ironman would not stand a chance against thor in the comics however nothing compares to the action sequence at the end with this epic action scene comes some cool and lines and comedy moments the must defend the city against an alien attack beautifully directed again and incredible graphics come together to make this awesome fight which was one of the best action sequences iv seen so dont sit around get 10 bucks and go down to the cinema and watch this movie and enjoy the action scenesthe wonderful script and comedy,fantasy
this film was great it had everything heroes villains a good story and smashing special effects if you are into comics and marvel this is definitely for you if not this is still for you there is something in it for everyone no matter age or gender it is definitely a film to watch this summer i will not give away any spoilers but it is a must that you stay after the credits as is custom in every marvel film it will be worth your waiti cannot wait for a sequel the only improvement i would give ismore superheroes,fantasy
okay what can i say that has not already been said this movie is brilliant it has everything action great acting a fantastic cast mind blowing effects humour suspense in shorteverything i had seen all the movies leading up to this hulk 2 iron man 1 and 2 thor and captain america i knew the were going to be good but this just blew me away all the original actors were back in their roles except for edward norton but mark ruffalo did a fine job chris hemsworth robert downey jr chris evans scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston clark gregg cobie smulders stellan skarsgrd and samuel l jackson were all spot on i loved the interaction between the various characters the clash of egos the tension it was not just put there because the writers thought it would move the plot along it was there because all of these guys have very specific personalities and at times they clashed samuel l jackson was very much in charge that man is perfect as nick fury its as if the role was created for him the exchanges between captain america and tony stark were amusing and at times downright clever chris evens and robert downey jr were perfect none of the actors hit a wrong note but special kudos to tom hiddleston as loki he made the film what it was he was the perfect antagonist that smile of his was enough to chill yet the scene between him and the hulk had the entire theatre roar with laughter i am not going to go into a real description here as many of the reviews already have but i will say this the is one of the best comic book movies to date it ranks up there with batman begins and the dark knight v for vendetta and watchmen thank you joss whedon for understanding the medium of comic books and having the vision to be able to bring the to life i just hope we see more film like this in the future,fantasy
i went into the with no expectations im not really all that big on the super hero movies but i dont dislike them either i have at least seen all the newest spiderman batman iron man and hulk movies being a teenage boy however when i heard about the i just thought it sounded stupid then when it was released i kept hearing great things so i thought maybe then when some friends invited me to go see it in imax i thought scarlett johansson on a screen the size of my house heck yes so i was pretty open minded and it was greati dont want to give too many spoilers so ill just break it into sections acting 810   robert downey jr gave a great performance as the narcissistic billionaire tony stark i thought his lines were very well scripted some of the best in the movie and he delivered them well   chris evans did well in his part as the confused captain america who is still used to living in the 1940s you will be slightly confused unless youve seen ca i watched it afterward and it cleared things up i do think he was slightly out shined by rdj who really stole the show but they both did a great job playing off of each other to show the tension between them  it is a little hard for me to pass judgement on scarlett johanssons performance as i was slightly distracted and by slightly i mean very by her hotness but i think she did well   mark ruffalo did quite well as the tortured bruce banner he managed to create a complex layered character with what was possibly fewer lines than any of the other super heroes in the movie dont quote me on that   chris hemsworth did surprisingly well as thor also i watched thor last night and was very underwhelmed with his performance it doesnt even compare to the  jeremy renner did ok as agent barton though i felt he tried to play up the bada mercenary guy a little too much   tom hiddleston did very well as loki once again i was impressed with him in thor as well he was just about the only one he portrayed a bad guy that was without a doubt a bad guy but that maybe was just a little misled and misunderstood as well he managed to make a lot of little as his character was one aspect where i felt the writing flopped a little bit   clark gregg did fine as agent coulson though his character was different than in the previous movies   cobie smulders was just ok i think perhaps shes more suited for comedy   samuel jackson did great as nick fury as expectedplot 710 it was much better than i expected very few plot holes if any unlike certain other summer blockbusters cough cough transformers the only thing i was ever really confused about was some of the backstory with thor and captain america since i hadnt yet seen themspecial effects 1010 amazing nuff saidconclusion 910 overall its everything a super hero movie should be,fantasy
best movie ive seen this year so far i saw it twice even though im a poor college student its awesome the characters are great and there are so many hilarious lines i was dying of laughter and im not usually one to laugh out loud while watching a movie unless its really really funny the acting is pretty darn good and graphics are amazing as well i cant wait to get this on dvd although i have to wait until like what september xd i also cant wait for the second one to come out and for captain america 2 and thor 2 to come out i watched captain america hulkthor after watching twice i wish i saw them beforehand but you dont have to oh and i wasnt too into these kind of superhero movies beforehand anyways you must must go see it ddd,fantasy
with each subtle hint at a future collaborative effort of various marvel superheroes it seems now that the entire worlds anticipation was growing to an immense level now that the has shattered various box office records and is on pace to top the 1 billion worldwide gross mark im sure anyone bothering to write up a review is doing so simply to state his or her case for how they enjoyed it not so much to tell others what to expectas far as that goes i was incredibly impressed with the my initial expectation of an actionpacked sfxlaced adrenaline rush were met with ease and nothing less would have been satisfactory for any decent superhero picture i also expected a movie with a hefty dose of comedic relief mainly because of robert downeys lighthearted take on iron man in both of his solo pictures this also turned out to be true and added just what the film needed in between extremely heavy scenes of fastpaced chaotic actionone of the strong dividing lines throughout recent years has been the casting choices for the various superheroes that have gotten both their own pictures and inclusion in the avenger initiative going all the way back to the newer incarnations of the hulk fans were unable to come to any semblance of a conclusion on who would be best for what and why why chris evans as captain america is a commonly heard question as is why didnt edward norton come back as the hulk unfortunately you cannot please everyone with so many pivotal casting decisions but i tend to feel that overall the characters portrayed in the are properly matched up to capable actors mark ruffalo does an excellent job as the mildmannered bruce banner jeremy renner and scarlet johansson are easily up to their respective characters hawkeye and black widow the rest of the team has experience in their roles from downeys iron man and evans captain america to chris hemsworths thor and samuel l jackson as nick fury but when combined on screen you cannot tell the rookies from the veteranssimply put the is the best superhero movie youre likely to come across in terms of sheer entertainment while i personally wouldnt rank it as my favorite a reservation i still hold for watchmen its without a doubt worth the price of admission and the incredible amount of hype its received an incredible feat of film production and merging talents the is destined to be remembered as a highwater mark in superhero cinema,fantasy
what can be said about this movie not much only that it is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time i personally thought this movie would fail simply because there are too many people heroes to follow along with in one movie how can the director please every fan especially if they all have different heroes i am very happy to say they pulled it off very well i have no favorite hero but i was pleased with how every character was introduced and developed the action was amazing the destruction was epic and the acting was very impressive with very few flaws here and there this movie is a perfect 8 i can safely say that this movie exceeded my expectations and i would recommend it to anyone that is into destructive realistic and well acted movies,fantasy
the i cant believe how impressed i am by seeing this movie the first scene in which nick fury gets demeaned by loki was awesome the 3d content was good but not very good in other words the movie was a heck of a goddamn ride completely awesome robert jr as iron man was at his best but for me the hulk stole the show the film was one of the best actionadventures i have ever seen and surprisingly their was a lot of comic content in it too there is a scene when the hulk punches thor in such a comic way that you tears come to your eyes as you laugh thor was better in the than he was in thor but hawk eye and black widow too did a heck of a job to me the film was an outstanding performance by all of the actors and loki did his best as the villain still the hulk ruled the movie mark ruffalo at his best awesome,fantasy
i appluade joss whedon for by achieving what seemed the impossiblethere is many moments in this film that i couldnt believe was going on like bruce banner and tony stark collaborating fanboy things like thatwhat surprised was this film doesnt loose its pace at allthe introduction of the characters into the felt smooth and naturalthe two big actors were mark ruffalo who is the new guy and has to fill in some big shoes and tom hiddleston who i thought was a wonderfully charismatic lokiim not discounting that the two chrisesscarlett johansonrobert downey jrjeremy renner and samuel l jackson didnt do a great jobthe action in this movie is filled with summer movie galorebut joss whedon knows how to develop and create characters you can actually care formichael bay which i really appreciatedi believe this film is a great start to the summer movie season,fantasy
awesome awesome awesome i have been a fan of marvel characters since i was a kid and nothing even comes close to being as awesome as this i was however a little disappointed in the 3d at my theater the projector music have been set on darker or something i only saw about 12 of a 3d effect i cant wait for more marvel films to come out the marvel characters were in full form i did however miss black panther his character is such a strong one of course the ladies in this film were hot as ever in their black spandex if you are thinking about skipping this one you are really going to miss out,fantasy
the movie  i dont really know what to expect massive disasters huge rescue team at first i dont really like the team up of thor captain america iron man hulk hawkeye and black widow in a squad against the naughty god of loki it is very true for a fictional movie to be irrational and illogical in some part of it but the combination itself seemed weird especially they came from a very different time and dimensions though it was explained very briefly in the movie i still cant find it successful to convince me with it i quite excited with the first 60minutes when the team was built up again with all conflicts and funny stuffs thanks to mr tony stark robert downey jr for his sense of humor actions were of course as expected you could never get enough of it though i might afraid you gonna find it somehow too easy somehow some part of it my favorite character certainly goes to miss natasha romanoff scarlett johansson with her witty techniques of interrogation the cast was used very wisely they played a very beautiful role in this movie storyline of every superheroes movie wasnt really worth discuss for good versus evil justice win over the bad guys plan and etc two things i like the most are the enough time 141minutes with no boredom and when the teammates were scattered all around but i dont really think when the superhero music played and they assembled with capt steve rogers took the lead was the climax that we really wanted to watch oldfashioned and too usual and i believe the ending wasnt that satisfying too it was very entertaining though worth every penny and i dont know may be its still one of the best movie in this year should get almost 5 almost,fantasy
flawless is a heavy word for a movie these days and coming from a pure comicsuper hero fan it adds even more weight to it but yes this movie exceeded all my expectations by far didnt have a single mistake or awkward moment and i have already watched it 2 times and i am planning for a 3rd soon from the dialog to the cast choices to the fight scenes it was a celebration of marvel comic books that only a guy like whedon could achieve but what about people that dont read comic books or just dont like super heroes that much well for them the will be one of the best blockbuster movies this year and they will leave the cinema in pure exhilaration go watch this movie now if you havent already for some strange reason,fantasy
we never quite expect good for reunion movies this time well marvel did everything okay and assemble their team in a surprising wayloki steals the cosmic cube and abducts 2 characters including hawkeye nick fury from shield must assemble his most trusted members even if at first there might be ego frictions thor joins in later in the movie especially that he is after loki the final battle takes place in the middle of manhattanin this movie loki tony stark and the hulk steals the show black widow is not bad either on martial arts battle the hawkeye character could use a movie of his own especially would be good to share the bill with the widow herself and stan lee has his momentwould not be bad to see an 2 but lets see the other sequels first,fantasy

this is is it this is the movie fanboys have been hyping ever since we got a glimpse at nick fury at the end of iron man the is marvels very ambitious attempt to bring their alistersat least the ones they possess the rights to all into one movie where they team up to fight evil to accomplish this momentous task marvel brought in joss whedonbuffy the vampire slayer firefly serenity to both cowrite and direct this film of sky high expectations whedon whom has proved himself to be excellent with ensemble casts has not directed a theatrical film since 2005s serinity which may have left fans scratching their heads when he was announced on top of the wildcard director the film also has to bring in all of the stars from the past marvel cinematic universe films into one movie without taking away from the other casts members as cool as the epic teamup sounds on paper is it really possible to bring all of these elements into one movie together under one visionread the rest httpwpmep1tyjdag,fantasy
this movie easily did even more than i expected it to do and i expected a lot bc i am a big fan loved the recent captain america iron man and hulk movies and i think joss whedon is maybe my favourite recent writer and director of anyone else out there ive been waiting for this movie since sam jacksons character from the government agency said stark knows hes not the only superhero in his world the avenger initiative is action packed fun just a superbly entertaining and well done movie i never would have believed it could be possible to put all of these characters in the same movie and do them all justice at least not unless the movie was more than three or four hours long what a fantastic fun movie this is i highly recommend it and already want to see it again,fantasy
this is one of the films me and my friends were dying to see this year the others are prometheus the dark knight returns the hobbit when it came to the theater i was completely out of my mind finally we bought the tickets and the show was about to start the idea of making movies about comicbook heroes one by one and then mixing them all in one film is a genius idea economically and sociologically iron man hulk thor captain america were great movies but this was beyond great this is what a comic book hero film should be 1 the acting all of the actors are so comfortable and relaxed that one has the feeling they truly are those characters most of them are oscar nominees some of them oscar winners mark ruffalo is the best bruce banner hats of to norton but he was not banner and he gives the best dramatic performance in the movie robert downey jr is i believe no longer acting he is tony stark cris hemsworth i had the feeling never really stopped playing thor and gave the exact same performance as in his own movie the greatest surprise was jeremy renner he was mind blowing as hawkeye he got the very essence of how stan lee imagined him scarlett johansson gave a slightly different role that in iron man 2 probably because she had a bigger and more important role here but it worked just fine the only one that was a little off track was captain america a young actor such as chris evans just couldnt break through on the screen with all the other strong characters and of course the almighty samuel l jackson is the master the student and the god as nick fury its really a shame he had so little screen time as he did 2 the story an amazing idea of creating a super villain that uses an alien army to conquer earth is something new a fresh idea the fact that it was loki another great performance makes the idea even better because of the relationship with thor the movie is divided in three parts and the first and third are the best the problem is the second part of the movie that was a little too long 144 min is a bit to long everything that was said could have been said in 15 min time less the end battle is so nervebreaking that i literally had no more nails to bite off quite a long story that concentrated 23 of the movie on the heroes themselves is great because every story that deals with people heroes or not is a good one 3 the music alan silvestry can do a good job but here he did a little less good in my opinion some sequences should have had better musical backgrounds the only sequence that the music fitted perfectly was the very end of the movie all in all a marvelous movie with magnificent performances a great story with many layers of emotion humor drama and psychology if you havent seen any other movie of these heroes you might have a problem understanding who is who and the relationships between them but in the end you get it all and that is a sign of a great script ladies and gentlemen this is the best superhero movie ever made,fantasy
some sad news and some happy news sad news so far it looks like we can expect an overall sour year for the movies just like 2011 was oh well happy news there will be at least one great film to remember at the end of the year and next year and the year after that the is the movie that comicbook fans as well as the entire world have been awaiting for a long time take me for example im one of a handful of people from my generation who has never read a comic book so i know nothing about how this movie or the films that predated it follow their source material i saw this film with a crowd of folks many of whom undoubtedly were familiar with the comics and i think i cherished it just as much as they did it is one tremendously smashing movie one not to be missed i need not report that the film brings together the heroes of recent hollywood extravaganzas what i do need to report is just how seamlessly and smoothly that transition is the movie brings together the characters of the iron man movies captain america the first avenger thor and the hulk pictures while paying idiosyncratic respect to each of their characteristics and personalities none overshadows or takes away from the other hard to imagine since it features tony stark robert downey jr one of the biggest egotists in recent movie history yet he does not steal the show from the mostly personalityfree captain america rogers chris evans the same applies to the inbetween characters such as nick fury an eye patchtoting samuel l jackson who seem to bind these sagas togetherthat is the key to this movies success the way it brings these characters together and allows them to play off each others personalities the casting is also perfect robert downey jr is no stranger to praise from me and he shells in another solid performance without i must reiterate taking away attention from his costars which is something he would have done if he were as egotistical as his character chris evans as captain america has more to do than he did in his source picture a movie i was not too enthralled by the same applies to chris hemsworth as the extraterrestrial being thor who before i thought was just a triple b big blond bore keeping his equally boring love interest out except in a brief reference in the middle was a smart choice on the filmmakers part and scarlett johansson proves james agees theory about casting in the movies its about finding the right people not the biggest talents miss johannson is not the biggest or more versatile talent in the movies today but she is deadright for the part of black widowa testament to the strength of the characters i will not reveal who but one beloved figure is bumped off now a supposedly important character died in captain america the first avenger and my emotional response to that moment was zip because i did not feel i understood that character as a human being the death scene in the is so strong and the director gives it just the right amount of time to play out that it left the entire auditorium silentafter a big gasp of disbeliefwatching the i was constantly given a sensation that ive always adored the impulse to sit back eyes wide and say wow that is really cool there are sequences in this picture most of them actionmoments that are so jawdroppingly strong and brilliantly executed that they really do make you wonder just how much effort the makers of the movie put into them it was not all computers i can tell you that much yet there are parts done exclusively with computers that truly are impressive and great to look at the highlights are giant alien worms which fly over and through new york city in the final sequence the movie was directed by a promising talent by the name of joss whedon and he demonstrates his discipline as a creative artist in the movies thirtyminute final battle as some folks in hollywood michael bay in particular need to learn it takes discipline and restraint to make a lengthy battle keep going without losing its edge mr whedon has both at the same time there are laughs in this movie so strong that i found myself still giggling by the time the next scene was up i am really tempted to give a few examples but i dont want to spoil them for anybody who has not seen the picture alreadydo i have anything negative to say about the well both of the epilogue scenes were utterly pointless ill admit that and some of the oneliners placed in the middle of the climax seem out of place and distracting from the carnage going on around them most of my gripes are nitpicks key example the director uses mirrors in several scenes and there was one regarding black widow and some interrogators where i wished he had toggled in instead of out i think you can tell i have to get desperate to shell out any complaintsi know a young woman who has seen this picture a total of three times now i am really tempted to go and see it a second time myself the which clocks in at two and a half hours is entertaining from beginning to end it also features some truly memorable music by the underrated alan silvestri this is the kind of music where you find yourself humming after the movies over not just ignoring during the show the is worth every penny of the 207 million is has earned thus far i hope it gets more it is one of the best moviegoing experiences ive had in a long while,fantasy
let me tell you now scarlett johansson chris hemsworth and chris evans were amazing i saw this movie opening weekend and i couldnt get enough i plan to go back and see it again this upcoming weekend natasha romanoffblack widow is my favorite character she is by far the best spyassassin ever if you havent seen itgo see it it is a must see movie i cant wait for there to be another one you will be sad if you dont see it scarlett johansson portrays her character so well if you want to see photos of the cast follow me on twitter mckenziecarter8 i am in the proses of creating an fan site if you follow me on twitter mckenziecarter8 i will inform you of when the site is complete there is not one thing wrong with this movie if you read the comic books the comics and the movie have a lot in common even if your not a fan of super heroes you will enjoy this movie greatly you will not regret it this movie is rated pg13 during the whole movie they only say about 1 cuss word if you like scarlett johansson chris evans chris hemsworth and robert downey jr then go see this movie do it you know you want too,fantasy
after years of insides jokes cameos hints and calculated introductions its finally led to this the pays off a promise made in 2008s iron man bringing together marvels greatest superheroes and two question marks for a battle to save the earth after theyre done pummeling one another a mildly clunky but largely soaring presentation of citywide devastation costumed hero neuroses and flamboyant evildoing the feature gathers all the details and character quirks fans could want from a supersized outing such as this and who better to direct than a man with practically his own religion in the realm of geeklandia joss whedonloki tom hiddleston has returned to power aligning himself with a fierce alien race known as the chitauri hoping to use the power of the tesseract to invade earth and enslave humanity while his early efforts to secure the power cube involved hypnotizing shield agent clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner into service loki finds himself blocked from further mayhem when

mark ruffalo steve rogerscaptain america chris evans natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson and thor chris hemsworth despite tensions and secretive motivations dividing the group the must learn to work together to thwart lokis devious plan of global conquest using combined powers rage and intelligence to rise up and defeat their powerful enemy and his relentless army of alien aggressorsas to be expected when dealing with a multitude of iconic characters the is one stuffed burrito of a motion picture not only must an original plot be established to introduce a worthy conflict for the heroes but most of these figures of justice require an update since their last adventure this leaves the opening half of the script sprinting forward with lokis rise to power as he clears a power cube runway for his space overlords while the rest of the time is devoted to dissecting sensitive superhero headspace catching up with the likes of the recently thawed steve rogers whos having trouble acclimating to contemporary society theres tony stark too growing domesticated with assistant pepper potts gwyneth paltrow while working to perfect a sustainable energy plan using arc technologyevery major personality receives time in the spotlight as whedon and cowriter zak penn make a herculean effort to bring together these forces of nature with a clean understanding of trepidation finding each member of the team greatly unnerved by lokis scheme bruce banners journey is especially interesting with the rebooting the good doctor for a third time since 2003 well played by ruffalo hulks second banana position is ideal for such a tragic figure challenging the production to articulate the doubt and turmoil raging within banner without the need to stretch simplistic internal instability over two hours here the doctor is a troubled man housing a dark impulse while hulk is displayed as beast of fury gradually finding an attitude of heroism with plenty of hulk smash action worked into the viewing experience a few of his scenes are sure to elicit standing ovationsits rather remarkable how well whedon manages the chaos establishing a crisp story of alien invasion while massaging conflicts within the group staging a few hero vs hero fight scenes that highlight the notsofriendly competition between these strangers thor is particularly troubled in this script displaying the god of thunder as a conflicted man torn between the defense of his adoptive home and his commitment to the safe return of loki back to asgard for a proper rehabilitation its an emotionally loaded subplot that doesnt exactly get its due yet remains tangible due to the hiddleston and hemsworths snarling commitment to the toxic reunion with so much to juggle including the interests of shield personnel cobie smulders and clark gregg costar its a wonder anything gets accomplished in the credit must be paid to penn and whedon who knit a fresh adventure out of dangling plot lines creating a distinct comic book tone to the effort with largerthanlife acts of bravery and transport the good guys take refuge in a flying aircraft carrier punctuated by distinct superhero charisma radiating from the majority of the castthe finale takes to the streets and skyscrapers of new york city a tired setting for the ultimate showdown where the begin to exercise their teamwork abilities to successfully repel the chitauri invasion the sequence is enormous with a few bravura shots providing a sense of scope to the superhero resistance sold with incredible visual effects  the hulks attack blasts are worth the price of admission alone joining the fray in a comfortably exaggerated manner the action is intense and extended keeping track of the as they unite and scatter hitting such thrilling notes of unity its easy to forget the films occasional faults and true to the marvel universe a few seeds are planted for further development in future sequels and personal adventureswith such a highflying spirit and big screen heft its difficult to imagine anyone walking out of the unsatisfied whedon and his team have pulled off an impossible task juggling ego and backstory with flair introducing the world to a united front of superheroes while most of these characters are still in the midst of their own individual narratives its an enormous picture supplying requisite jolts of courage and contemplation with panache,fantasy
i think this is the best super heros movie ever created ever what if someone breaks this record but it will never happen was this movie satisfied all super hero lovers oh yeah when the movie started i was thinking iron man will get more applause than others but hulk got more response than iron man especially climax scene when hulk came into the battle field in motorbike wow he came just like that about the story same old story saving the world from the destroyers but the screenplay and dialogs are very casual and especially humors are really good movie starts with loki has joined with enemy of asgard and planning to acquire the blue cube then what he came to earth and got that cube from nick fury director of shield then as usual nick fury wants that cube because it will destroy the earth so he has to assemble the super heroes because loki has the aliens army rest of the story we all know i told about the response from the theater for the movie from the six super heroes iron man robert downey jr hulk mark ruffalo ca chris evans thor chirs hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner loki tom hiddleston and nick fury samuel l jackson initially ironman got the number fans but the end of the film some of them were changed to hulk not me  i like hulk too apart from the i like loki he got a great stylei think all credits should goes to stan lee creator of the avnegers and joss whedon for the making of the finally 1010i mean it every super hero lovers and non lovers should see the film,fantasy
go see this movie like right now just drop everything and go see this movie it is 100 worth itwhen loki the god of mischief who we saw in thorplayed by tom hiddleston threatens the safety of the world shield director nick fury played by samuel l jackson brings together a team of superheroes most of which come from the last few marvel superheroes movies iron man played brilliantly once again by robert downey jr captain america played by chris evans the incredible hulk played by mark ruffalo taking over for edward norton thor played by chris hemsworth black widow played by the beautiful scarlett johansson and hawkeye played by jeremy renner together they must stop loki from initiating his planlet me just say this as my starting point for the review a movie about a team of superheroes is always risky to make the risk being that perhaps one of the superheroes will get the short end of the stick well i can easily say that each one of the get their own scenes their own stories and their own moments in other words thank god for joss whedon and his team for coming up with a script in which everyone plays a good part of the story in some waynow the actors each one of them does a very good job in their role samuel l jackson as always is very good as nick fury tom hiddleston really knows how to deliver the bad guy character especially when it comes to the norse god of mischief jeremy renner is great as hawkeye as is scarlet johansson as black widow you can tell that there is something between the two characters chris hemsworth is great as thor and mark ruffalo proves that he is one of the better actors when portraying bruce bannerthe hulk chris evans is great as captain america and of course like i said robert downey jr brilliantly plays the iron man character well just seeing someone so noble like captain america argue with someone really arrogant and cocky like iron man is always a pleasure to watchas for the action sequences and the special effects do i really even need to comment on this part this is the reason why you are seeing this movie or at least the main reason you want to see these guys battle it out in awesome battle sequences which they do the 3d believe it or not is actually pretty good in those sequences specifically when something blows up and debris is flying everywhere and when hawkeyes arrows go toward the screenall in all a really great movie joss whedon we trusted you and you did not let us down buddy if you want ill get you a beer and we can talk about the sequel speaking of which stay after the credits the lives up to the excitement with a script that never loses the heroes compassion and with great action sequences a 1010 for me,fantasy
i had my reservations about avenger assemble for a long time it is not my sort of film the only previous films in the saga i saw before this were iron man which i didnt like and captain america which i did what made captain america for me was that it was interesting that is was set against the backdrop of world war ii and the redeeming feature of iron man was the witty dialogue between robert downey jr and gwyneth paltrow so the task is how do they make a film with all of these stars with so much backstory set in the modern era without it turning into iron man 25 which it does in places that lives up to the massive hype lets face it since the film has been building up peoples expectations for that long and with so many huge stars competing for screen time and the best dialogue it was never going to be anything but a little bit of a mess what it is though is an enjoyable mess they dont go down the route of the transformers films revenge of the fallen in particular and just spend 2 hours making 2 dimensional robot characters smash each other up assamble is enjoyable because of the characters involved it is to its advantage that the backstories for most of the main characters have been established already it means that we can just get on with the film and not spend to much time discussing the wherefores and the hows it is also good that despite having only seen 2 of the previous 5 films i was able to understand perfectly well what was going on the film the story is very simple and not at all confusing unlike transformers rotf and requires very little thinking if you do take anytime to actually think about the film it is clearly just a slot a into tab b affair very predictable and formulaic but if you take it for what it is and enjoy the ride it is very entertaining it is the characters that make the film unlike the transformers films the characters are all unique and well rounded they all seem to have their own part to play apart from black widow who aside from looking good and being the token female seems to have nothing to do and no real superpowers it does turn a little into iron man 25 at times after all it is clear he has the best powers and robert downey jr is the biggest star so it is hard not too some of his lines do get a little less witty and a little more silly at times but it is never really too much of a problem each character does have their part to play and it was interesting watching their interplay on screen the film as a whole was nothing more than a formulaic affair going from confrontation to confrontation without much to link it together but this is not really a problem it relies heavily on special effects which is ok since they work well in the context of the film the final huge cgi fest that was the end battle was done very well with each character getting a similar amount to do with the exception of black widow and it was consistently interesting unlike the climaxes of the transformers films which were just dumb smash em ups for an hour i do take issue with one thing though a tiny amount of cgi in the climax battle was quite poor scarlett johansson flying on the hoverbike thing almost unforgivable in a film that relies to heavily on special effects and which has such a big budget the actors do a great job for me mark ruffalo stealing the show with his unhinged unstable banner though tom hiddleston was great too it is this that makes the film so watchable without such interesting characters the film would just be a big dumb mess in the end the film is nothing more than formulaic but a very well done formulaic film the director whedon clearly knew exactly what he was doing at every scene of the film i think it is very commendable that with the amount of hype surrounding the film and the number of stars competing in the film that he has formed anything other than a complete mess when it comes down to it assemble is an enjoyable film made so by the characters and the actors portraying them it is very funny at times and surprisingly never boring its not particularly clever but it knows how to appeal to a wide audience and fans alike and it is an achievement,fantasy
it all led to this back story after back story of super heroes that included a billionaire playboygeniusarms merchant who invented a powered suit a physicist whose accidental exposure to gamma radiation created a monster a norse god of thunder who landed upon earth and a patriotic soldier who froze through a generation after fighting a world war these marvel characters were approached by nick fury of shield in post credit scenes to join him in an initiative that would form a team of superheroes who would protect the earth from its nemesis director joss whedon manages to assemble this team of distinct combative and snappy heroes who pounce upon the opportunity to take each other down so far undermining the threat from asgardessentially as a sequel to thor the revolves around the tesseract a cosmic cube that opens up portals and possesses unlimited energy evil brother loki tom hiddleston arrives through the portal and steals the cube from shields headquarters leaving trails of destruction and havoc in a desperate attempt fury summons the superheroes to save the day from lokis malicious plans of dominance it is then upon the films most spectacular visual effect shields aerial aircraft carrier base where the assemble within its confines is lokis looming threat of destruction with an alien army doctor banners angermanagement issue and the everconfrontational superheroes who yet have to come to terms with sharing a room and an objective no sooner had they settled their issues does the alien army arrive through the portal opened by loki over the manhattan skies the will need leadership teamwork and relentless power to overcome their countless enemies and hereon begins the absolute mayhem that one would expect from such an assembly of heroes reminiscent of the carnage of cities as seen in the transformers movies manhattan gets bombed shot smashed and almost nuked in the climax battle but what makes whedons destruction unique is that it has our superheroes having fun while doing it starks humor and hulks raw awesomeness will overpower the usual exploding and flying captain americas disciplined mature understanding also makes him an efficient leader chris evans provides the composure to the leader and while his gunfistshield defense is mediocre in comparison to the likes of his contemporaries he does well in his stunts and brings credibility to his powers black widow is played by the stunning scarlett johansson whose stealthy moves as a gymnast and effective use of martial arts give her a deceiving advantage hawkeye spends half his time on screen on lokis side after he was hypnotized in the beginning in the climactic battle jeremy renner looks better when he is a part of the team and his hawklike precision with arrows is fun to watch in the midst of bigger powers chris hemsworth was impressive as the norse god of thunder and he returns to correct his evil brother loki his confrontations with ironman and the hulk provide enormous entertainment while his place in the team with the inseparable mjolinor is vital when combating the immortal villains mark ruffalo proves to be an edgy anxious yet intellectual doctor banner whose angry side is the films most enjoyable action star the hulk smashes his way through his teammates through buildings aliens their transports and in what was perhaps the best scene of the film through lokis condescending remarks robert downey jr makes a mega action movie fun to watchits not that ironmans screen time dominated the but if youve just had a hearty laugh it was because tony stark said something beyond the entertainment value ironman delivers the awesomeness with his suits supercool evolution the most striking feature too is that stark embraces the idea of the initiative and understands the power their combined forces possess even with his ego he values teamwork to execute any plan with such a mighty force to defend the planet the villain had to be more powerful cunning and deceiving in order to make the movie work tom hiddleston does just that as loki with the malicious smile and unsympathetic attitude towards humans he makes a villain we want to hate even though his staff is a separable weapon it is his immortality that makes him formidable loki had to be ambitious conniving and audacious to overcome the earth in presence of the and hiddleston adds that credibility to the asgardian joss whedon takes his time in bringing the characters and plot together before heading into a fullblown battle his other big achievement is balancing the screen times for each of the characters because of that we realize that we are watching the and not just another superhero movie action and entertainment are abundant especially when these superheroes are confronting each other just as he builds up the tension he introduces a character in heroic fashion thus giving us those cheering momentscertainly there are aspects that can see improvisation in future but for all the buildup effort time and bigbudget that went into making the ultimate superhero movie the was well worth the wait and it smashes the hype in true hulk style no matter what format you watch it in theres just a lot going on to notice technical details so be prepared for repeat viewing one cant help but admire the initiative taken by marvel a few years ago with one idea of the they created a gargantuan ecosystem in movies that will garner billions of dollars for decades to come each of the superheroes will have sequels and the of course will return to save mankind from foes too powerful for our measly human forces if thats a lot of scifi fantasy we will gladly take all of it918 on a scale of 110,fantasy
absolutely fantastic as far as marvel movies come while i was not able to sit through captain america thor or the incredible hulk standalone this was a great tie in for all of them joss whedon pulled this off with stunning visuals not unlike ironman 1  2the good stuff being said i could not help but feel like comparing it to the transformers movies during the final action sequences im not sure why but it somewhat felt like a close attempt to a michael bay style action flick in the end its better than the other marvel movies with the exception being iron man by a long shot and as long as you can keep dark of the moon out of your mind through it you should be able to find a lot of fun with it,fantasy
as a major marvel comic book fan in my younger and more glamorous days i am by no means exaggerating when i say i have been waiting for an film to be made for the last 15 or so years at times the concept of having so many superheroes contained in one film seemed an impossible challenge but joss whedon who also made serenity a fantastic scifi film if you havent already seen it has attempted the challenge and succeeded with great resultsfocusing on a plan by loki younger brother of thor to destroy the world we see samuel l jackson as nick fury finally put together his initiative plan that has been referenced over the last few years throughout marvel films usually after the credits forcing people like myself to sit in the cinema for 10 minutes after everyone has gone and look like a complete weirdo to cinema staff waiting to clean the screen we thus see a crew of erratic and potentially volatile characters hulk iron man black widow thor captain america and hawkeye doing his best legolas impression reluctantly join each other for this major operation and what ensues is both action and hilarity and then more hilarityyes whilst being an action film contains more slapstick humour and oneliners than the majority of comedies made in the last decade notably from robert downey jr as tony stark who just seems like a naturally funny guy in real life the action setpieces are great and dont drag on for too long cough transformers cough whilst the flurry of different personalities at disposal in the film means that there is enough variation to make the 143mins zoom by personally the hulk stole the show for me a surprise considering the last two films about his character were so poor the majority of people watching the film will know what to expect so ill keep this review short but to sum up great film does what it says on the tin910,fantasy
okay first offif you are expecting to see an oscar nominated artsy filmyou are in the wrong theaterif you want so see a great action summer blockbuster moviethen go see theafter reading some of the negative reviews here i am left baffled i wonder if these reviewers were hoping to see some deep and anguish laden heart wrenching drama this is a movie about a group of superheroes and for what it is it was very well made it was funny full of great action sequences and tons of top notch cgi and stunts every thing that a movie of this genre should haveif you feel like have 25 hours of fun and some serious escapismgo see this movie if you want to see a movie that will tug at you heart strings and leave wondering about the injustices of lifego see another movie,fantasy
by the time this review is up most of us have already seen this movietwice the hulksmashed all boxoffice records and will undoubtedly become one of the most successful movies of all time  and it should the successfully brings together separate marvel heroes and their franchises by refusing to be overburdened with their separate backgrounds and character arcs the main plot concerns thors divine brother loki who was defeated in thor and is now in the service of some alien priestthing known as the other who promises loki an army of unbeatable alien warriors with which he can become ruler of earth in exchange loki must give him the tesseract a cube which is an endless source of energy simple endoftheworld type stuff right the movie has an infectious enthusiasm about its opportunity to put so many heroes in one film and this makes seeing each character in action fun in a giddy comicbook geek kind of way who needs to see captain america cry over lost love when we can have the hulk pummel a god of asgard through five different layers of concrete what are these aliens and why are they here who cares they all just get their heads blown off by a thousand stark industries rockets fired from iron mans shoulders so stop asking critical questionshawkeye and black widow these two members of the team are by far the least compelling  they dont even have their own movies or review paragraphs hawkeye is a superassassin with a quiver that can arm his arrows in innumerable ways to act as explosives grappling lines etc and black widow who was in iron man 2 is a russian superagent who apparently knows every martial art and thinks the best weapon to use against an alien horde is two small pistols these characters are the movies weakest point as they both make references to past missions they shared together and troubled histories but since their backgrounds are given no context these references leave us wondering what the hell theyre talking about the aversion to the other heroes emotionallycontrived backstories in favor of fist fights and sardonicism is abandoned here as it attempts to bring dramatic depth to the two members we care about the least lets get back to the heroes with actual powers no one cares about your ledger scarlett johansson iron man how would a movie be able to poke fun at captain america thor or the hulk without tony stark whenever the threatens to get serious and dramatic with its characters or scenes the man in the iron suit is there to save the audience from tedium with sarcastic wit and while iron mans sarcasm gets overextended at times yes we are aware that tony stark is irreverent robert downey jr always shows an underlying seriousness about the tasks that brings some actual poignancy to his sacrifices later in the movie along with the hulk iron man is one of the more complex and developed heroes that is shown to be more human than comicbook caricature having a robotic suit as a power also balances the more biological or divine powers of iron mans teammates as we get to witness supertech fighting along with superstrength how can we not love iron man the hulk surprisingly at least to me mark ruffalos hulk becomes perhaps the best hero of the instead of being obsessed with bruce banners childhood traumas and anger issues so that we empathize with a green rage monster the presents a banner that is much more focused in the present he wants to help those in need and wants to avoid turning into the other guy why wellbecause then people get hurt this also allows mark ruffalo to create a more interesting banner that is concerned with something other than avoiding the hulk alter ego and an american military interested in his power bruce banner initially arrives as a member of the for his knowledge about gamma radiation and his ability to tract the tesseract cube not for his ability to hulkout ruffalo brings a quiet sarcastic apathy to the team and also plays the hulk through motion capture which makes us connect with banner before we see the hulk  who thanks to johansson we sometimes fear and even wish to not appear banners condition is initially presented as something the team must avoid triggering which means that when he arrives in full control of his power which isnt really explained we actually move from fearing the hulk to rooting for him banners ambiguity extends to how we feel about his alterego which means that this is finally the hulk done properly so it isnt surprising that some of the more humorous and kickass moments come from ruffalos other guy from the moment that hulk is told to smash we watch him tear apart an alien army and everyone including the audience breathes a little easier knowing that hes on our side im actually hoping that ruffalo gets his own hulk movie franchiseoh and we of course have samuel l jackson as the coordinator nick fury who reports to a nameless human council that wants him blowing up new york to prevent an alien invasion instead of depending upon a superhero team plot device anyone jackson is fine in the role and like every other character in the fits in his proper place to produce a coherent and entertaining blockbuster,fantasy
it is appropriate that this film was better than the sum of the films that preceded it it is very close to be the best written film of its genre and it ought to be in the oscar running for best screenplay just a few redundancies from other films kept this film from becoming great and those redundancies may have been mandatory as this type of film has to be slaved to a legacy of comic history it was the first film of its type at least to my knowledge that generated appropriate spontaneous uproarious laughtercheers from the audience from brilliantly surprising scenes and you wont see them coming they will just happen the acting is uniformly excellent throughout a highly recommended film,fantasy
hyped as the greatest superhero film ever made 2012s the is an entertaining superhero team flick loki tom hiddleston introduced in 2011s thor comes to earth intent on an otherworldly invasion and total conquest nick fury samuel l jackson of the federal agency shield gathers together earths mightiest heroes to prevent the invasion  captain america iron man thor the black widow hawkeye and believe it or not the hulkthe films hype and recordbreaking success raises expectations that are letdown by a setup that goes on  on and isnt overly absorbing plus way too much time is spent on the shield helicarrier which creates a somewhat onedimensional vibe lastly although loki is an excellent villain the otherworldly army known as the chitauri are stereotypically eevil faceless villains who are way tooeasily slaughtered excepting the colossal mechanical snakecreaturesdespite those few negatives there are numerous highlights scarlett johannson as black widow straightlaced and oldfashioned captain america at odds with the overlyhip tony starkiron man chris evans and robert downey jr respectively chris hemsworth as the noble thor samuel l jackson as nick fury a touching subplot concerning the black widow  hawkeye jeremey renner and mark ruffalo as bruce bannerspeaking of bruce banner the hulk easily steals the show the best scenes and literal punch lines have to do with the hulk as much as i like both the 03 and 08 film versions of the green goliath this is the definitive renditionfinal word the is definitely an entertaining superhero team flick but it has its shortcomings a slow buildup the onedimensional setting and a weak army of foes work against the movie but its filled with a myriad highlights including the hulk and the witty dialog the third act delivers the goods as a wholly kinetic and engaging superhero team flickthe film runs 142 minutesgrade a,fantasy
as they say in comic books  bam kapow while thats not really what the superheroes of the have to say they are much more articulate their actions are fairly true to their comic book roots kids first youth film critics julianna no one and talia rashba each give the film a full 5 out of 5 stars and are quite articulate on their reasons for the top ratingtalia rashba httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvs78fik503mgthis movie is absolutely fantastic it is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad the story is about a group of famous superheroes that come together to defeat the evil loki who has stolen a powerful energy cube that he intends to use to take over the world the superheroes include iron man captain america the hulk thor black widow and hawkeye each with a unique and special supernatural power at first the superheroes fight about being a team but eventually they work togetherthe could have ended up being a typical superhero movie but it isnt because there are so many heroes it is much more creative and entertaining the is packed with fabulous actors robert downey jr plays tony stark also known as iron man just like he was in the iron man movie he thinks he is better than everyone else but luckily he is really quite funny so you end up liking him a lot captain america chris evans is strong and serious and he is always ready to get the job done actor mark ruffalo plays the ferocious green form known as the incredible hulk he really stands out and takes over the scenes he is in superhero thor chris hemsworth has some of the most incredible battle scenes and black widow portrayed by the beautiful scarlett johansson is the one who convinces the others to put aside their differences and work with each other an interesting fact is that actor lou ferrigno who has played the hulk in almost every film since 1978 is actually the hulks voice in the movie the is written and directed by joss whedon who does an amazing job he makes sure that there is a lot of humor in the movie and that the action scenes really grab your attention the special effects were incredible the superheroes change from their everyday selves into their supernatural selves in an interesting and fun way the fight scenes and explosions are unbelievable also there is a really neat headquarters for the agency that you just have to see for yourself even though it is rated pg13 i think kids ages 11 as well as all adults will love this movie especially if action is their thing i am giving this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommending that you see it right away julianna no one httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmet6petkfaqlooking for a hero well look no further because the is in theaters everywhere this actionpacked and comedyfilled film is a movie that appeals to comic book fans and all moviegoers with its great storyline and a strong cast the basis of this movie is the world is under threat from another world chitauri and there is a need for more than just all the worlds defenses to save it the world needs the avenger initiative which is a plan put together by shield an international peacekeeping agency which calls for shield to bring together some of the worlds greatest heroes robert downey jr chris hemsworth chris evans mark ruffalo scarlett johansson and jeremy renner nick fury played by the always intense samuel l jackson leads the shield agency i have watched all of the individual movie releases of the hulk thor captain america and both iron man movies and loved them all but as most was concerned whether they would work together to create a great movie well they have done that and more with a storyline that allows the main characters to at times shine on their own but at other times pairs them up perfectly to bring great balance to the story josh whedon director and cowriter and zach penn cowriter blend the action sequences in with very welltimed comedic moments i love how they bring so many different levels of conflict into the movie there is brother vs brother between thor and his evil brother loki tom hiddleston the films antagonist there is internal conflict each of the main characters has with themselves as we watch dr banner trying to control his inner demons and there is the overall conflict of our world vs the other world called chitauri there is also the conflict between the heroes themselves which leads to many of the funniest parts of the film my favorite scene is when the heroes first come together on the shield aircraft and are discussing the devastation that loki has brought to earth thor jumps to lokis defense and states hes my brother to which the black widow responds he has killed 80 people in two days thor responds hes adopted its one of the many laughoutloud moments my favorite characters would be the as a whole as they each have their own unique and likable traits i love the special effects particularly the touch screen computers that float in the air and the use of cgi in this film as it was worked into the liveaction sequences the cgi hulk was especially well done and was much more humanlike in this film and funny as well this movie is great for all ages and i rate it 5 out of 5 stars its a mustsee movie for comic book and noncomic book fans,fantasy
first of all ill say that im ranking this as a 9 out of 10 for an action picture maybe its an 8 across all genres i always ranked xmen and ironman as the top marvel movies ghost riderdaredevilfantastic4 as the worst i thought capt america and thor was ok as far as their own movies throw them all together and wow things i liked each hero was showcased in some form or another ironmans rocking arrival the internal conflict among heroes things i didnt like although scarlett played her role very well i do think showcasing black widow was a mistake those tiny pistols against the army ping ping it did look pretty pathetic secondly i realize that capt americas uniform is original but he stood out like a bad halloween costume perhaps a very dark blue would have been better best scene hulk and loki ive never seen 500 people erupt in cheers and clapping a few standing ovations as hulk responded to lokis rant id likely pay the 13 simply to see that scene againim curious to read the script i wonder how much of the film is choreographed in the script there wasnt a lot of dialogue but when there was it was excellent by far the best pure action movie ive scene that i can remember awesome awesome awesometo those that havent seen the movie make sure you watch the credits wink,fantasy
i know there were some concerns out there regarding the former creator of buffy and angel doing the screenplay and directing and there were also a few eyebrows raised when disney took over the marvel brand but everyone can relax because this flag is up the pole and everyone is salutingrobert downey jr is especially his arrogant self as tony stark and i loved the scenes where he and gwyneth paltrow are acting like a couple his interactions with chris evans and mark ruffalo set the stage for the internal conflicts with each other and samuel l jackson the dynamics of the characters could not have been any betterand speaking of the newest member of the marvel character crew hats off to mark ruffalo who took a role once played poorly by eric bana and somewhat better by ed norton and not only made it his own but made bruce banner come to life in realistic ways his persona as the more aggressive scientist with self control and determination lends to the idea such a being might be controlled or at least directedchris hemsworth and tom hiddleston play beautifully off one another which gives us the impression of the asgardian egos and the depths to which they extend scarlett johansson and jeremy renner are perfect as the bodyguards ne assassins who are as courageous as they are talented and clark gregg reprises his role from iron man and thor to remind us there are always dedicated men who are simply trying to do their job in spite of extraordinary circumstancesthe story is fast paced and wastes little time in exposition with smidgens of personal lives and assignments interspersed in the film overall the cinematography is exceptional the graphics are phenomenal and the entire film has the flow and character of the comic books okay graphic novels of our misspent youth i went in expecting an epic and was not disappointed rated pg13 for violence and a mild reference to drugs anyone who ever read the stories and those of us who love the prequels lets face it folks iron man thor etc were all prequels to this event will love this film ive already reserved a copy for my collection and you should too,fantasy
i have been waiting for a movie to finally come out that can make me laugh cry and just be amazed without overdoing anything which almost all recent movies have done in the past several years i am very hard on movies but there is no way i am giving this anything less than a 10 this movie holds up to all the standards of good movieism and i am extremely excited to see what comes our way in the future from this movienot sure if the next paragraph counts but spoiler here just in casethumbs up for all the actors as well who accepted to return continuity gets fishy there but you guys came back and that gives you all a big thumbs up from me,fantasy
i gotta say when i went to the cinema i had high expectations but this movie went over my expectations it has a good storyline and i like the idea of putting many known heroes in the same movie actually i wonder why no one has done that before in a hollywood movie recently it was fun to watch these brilliant characters come together and fight togetherone of the good things about this movie is that it has the humor from iron man which is excellent even though this movie is an action movie with a lot of explosions it has scenes where everyone in the cinema laughed so much you couldnt hear the movie anymore the action part is also great it hasnt got too much special effects and every single on of them is accurate in fact all of the computer work is brilliant the acting is very good too all the actors get their characters so well robert is so great at acting tony stark you could think he isnt actingi didnt see any fails or wanted something different and i had a real blast while watching so it deserves nothing less than a 1010,fantasy
the was a film with so much hype it was of course difficult to see it really living up to expectations the film absolutely does and then some wasting little time with exposition we meet all the characters fairly quickly making for an impressive feat in that the film ran at over two hours if you have seen at least some of the films starring these characters you will be more than aware of them but even if you havent it is not difficult to pick up on the characters that have had their own films in the case of the hulk it really doesnt matter so newcomers are welcome but some familiarity with thor may be of preference although personally i didnt have it in terms of the development it seemed as though there was an inevitability that some would get the upper hand namely iron man captain america and thor with some coming for the hulk the likes of black widow and hawkeye having less but still getting enough to get by even if black widows felt a little like it was produced in short bursts even early in the film i felt like iron man was stealing the show this felt like a strength as egos can become rife in the characters if they are not written properly luckily we didnt have to endure poorly written blanket egos on screen the hulk was probably the character that stole the show throughout the entire film at least outside of the villain loki the hulk was approached in a humorous manner devoid of complete seriousness from eric banas and semi seriousness from edward nortons the character is played in some way for comedic effect and once the hulk is on screen he has the largest presence out of all of characters and mark ruffalo played it brilliantly knowing exactly what he was there for back to loki where he worked as a strong villain never quite making for a hammy comic book villain tailored for a family audience or the dark interpretation that has become typically associated with christopher nolans batman films in terms of action it was excellent earlier parts of the film were lacking light at all so it may be worth missing 3d however the action later in the film worked brilliantly in 3d especially for a post conversion for some viewers it may bring back memories of transformers dark of the moon but at no point was it a cluster of images the works as a film not requiring multiple things happening on screen and unlike the transformers films the action always stayed exciting and left you wanting more it also utilises humour in a brilliant way using it fairly frequently without reaching gag territory all in all it is a very fun film and should you not like superhero films because if you do you dont need me to tell you to see itthen you should just see it as it works as just a fun and sometimes epic summer blockbuster,fantasy
i can say you must absolutely watch this movie visual effects are fantastic and this best movie ive ever seen so my vote is 10 of 10 while i was watching moviei excited every minutes from the start to the end the movie was really goodthats why you must watch the movie if you carry heroes of marvel comicyou will watch this movie at the end of movie you mustnt go anywhere you must wait some minutes and a scene will come it is about other movie will comein the scene you will see bad character of the other moviefirst you cant understand i guess you think who is he  i am here for answer the question d he is thanos i say again watch this moviewatch this moviewatch this movie,fantasy
im one of those fans that was extremely hyped up about the possibility of an actual movie coming to the big screens however when production started i was terrified it seemed to go by so quick and i was afraid that giving this huge and potentially epic movie to whedon couldve back fired i mean i know that he was up and coming and this his previous work was good but for something of this magnitude i was fearful all i have to say is thank you for giving whedon the vote of confidence he absolutely nailed this movie it was not only a homerun in my eyes it was a grand slam he was able to bring all of these different personalities onoff screen and make it work the story line was solid the vision for this movie was vast and whedon along with the writers producers and fx crew exceeded expectations this movie blew me away it had a great pace to it and the actors deliveredmy only critique would be captain america to be honest i was never really sold on chris evans he did a decent job in the solo movie but i dont know hes just not captain america to me it seemed like he followed orders more than taking control of the team with the exception of that sequence towards the end i understand that this is all a build up for another cap movie and ultimately 2 i think that its just chris evans he doesnt demand that onscreen presence that youd figure captain america to haveaside from that this movie was absolutely excellent great story awesome acting especially from the loki character amazing action unbelievable fx and they have a hulk how could you beat that 95 out of 10 in my book and alls i got to say is avatarwatch out the are coming for the record books,fantasy
marvel studios has finally brought the whole team together after years of hinting at the initiative coming to fruition to fight united against evil they have done it the was not only a reunion of marvels best loved superheroes but it is a fun and funny actionpacked blockbuster movie to kick off the summer movie season as it opened to an astounding 2074 million the single biggest grossing domestic film opening weekend of all time it topped harry potter and the deathly hallows  part 2 by more than 38 million the previous record holder why has this film done so well everyone loves it the critics love it 93 rotten tomatoes rating and marvel fans love it and the average moviegoer has loved it the film is almost completely devoid of romance and sex which hurts some of the draw of female audiences but its nonstop action fastpaced storyline and awesome special effects keeps viewers engaged the odd joke thrown in here and there is a brilliant touch that does irritate but instead adds to the experience check out my full review here httpreelstorymoviesblogspotcom201205marvelshtml,fantasy
this is a well done comic book superhero film for everyone special effects even in the 2d version are definitely worth the price of the admission ticket we all thoroughly enjoyed the film the film does get off to a good start and then it does slow down a bit to construct the plot and the character interaction to make it all work but when that is done the film becomes a roller coater ride of special effects and action that is a treat to watch good humor good plot build good character development and just plain well done the only reason we didnt give it a 10 is because we did not see the 3d version and the slow build in the center that by the way is totally necessary that makes the film worth seeing be sure to see this while its in the theaters first film in a while that is worth every penny,fantasy
i went to see this with a few friends and one of them described it probably as well as can be he called it probably the best comic book adaptation hes ever seen of course what its adapting is one of those all out action issues so theres not a whole lot of depth and significance to what happens this is about good energetically punching evil in the nose while joss whedons style of comedy flows in and out like a rapid tide but while you cant put this on the same narrative level as the dark knight or even batman begins or superman ii this is one kick ass thrill ride of a motion picture it is stuffed to the gills with so much great stuff that whedon deserves some sort of award just for keeping it all from collapsing in on itselfloki tom hiddleston the asgardian god of mischief who was lost to the void at the end of the thor movie returns here in service to an alien horde he comes to earth and steals the tessaract the glowing blue box from the captain america movie and seeks to use it to open a portal that will allow the alien army to invade and conquer the world to stop him superspy nick fury samuel l jackson assembles a team of thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr the hulk mark ruffalo and black widow scarlett johansson loki meanwhile uses his power to seize control of the minds of professor selvig from the thor movie to construct his portal and shield agent hawkeye jeremy renner to assist him a whole lot of fighting ensues particularly on the incredible shield helicarrier and the streets and skies of new york city as the try to defeat loki and repel the alien threatlet me say again joss whedon does a tremendous job hear managing all the moving parts in this script and the production theres a very large cast of characters and theyre all put to some use and there are a whole lot of special effects and action scenes nearly all of which are spectacular theres also likely more humor here than in any marvel superhero flick to date and while some of it is a bit much in that way whedon always goes for a laugh just as the tension or drama is kicking into high gear most of it is simply damn funnyunsurprisingly robert downey jr and tony stark pretty much owns every scene hes in but chris evans and mark ruffalo prove to be excellent sparring partner for rdj in their scenes together scarlett johansson is also very effective in a surprisingly large role whedon is known for his female characters and hes taken jonhassons window dressing role from iron man ii and remade her into a tough smart woman who still blanches a bit at being normal amongst geniuses superhumans and extradimensional gods i do have to say that large doses of samuel l jackson as nick fury turns out to a better idea in theory than in practice sort of like mace windu but cobie smulders does a nice job as shield agent maria hill and clark gregg is wonderful as agent coulsonif youre looking for a good time im not sure theres any way youll be disappointed by the if you are maybe you need to stop going to see this kind of films i wasnt that impressed with either the thor or captain america movies and felt iron man ii was burdened with having too much stuff crammed into it i am impressed with this film even though its packed to the brim with even more its made me excited about a possible black widow movie and hopeful of seeing ruffalo in yet another hulk film as long as whedons involvednot that you need to hear this from me but dont miss this,fantasy
in the recent decade marvel studios has triumphed over several competing movies with a wide variety heroes or antiheroes all with different skill sets and abilities but never has it been decided to make a film that unites the greatest marvel characters of all timeuntil now its an interesting concept because ideas this massive can either fail without recompense or it moves beyond the status quo its a high risk but with the right balance things will pull through as for this movie the whole execution plays out well but there are still some things that could have been done differentlystarting off with one of the bad things is that this movie is a super sequel its not like marvel studios just decided to go with this idea from the blue this whole movie was built up through the story telling of all the marvel characters that are at the center of this story the problem with this is that if a moviegoer is one who doesnt like skipping films and watching sequels out of order this could be somewhat frustrating because then the viewer will want to know how all the other characters came to be and not focus on what is currently happening in the movieback to the good all the actors in this movie are phenomenal robert downey jr still keeps his charm as the smart mouthed but yet intelligent billionaire tony stark chris evans is still cool as captain america in some ways he reminds of the rocketeer 1991 because of his hairstyle and clothing that he wears it screams out cliff secord every time captain america was on screen mark ruffalo was great as bruce banner even the hulk was given some comedic parts in the film which was great because it shows hes not all brawn chris hemsworth is also fun to watch especially when hes whacking his hammer into everything i will not say what every other actor does in this film because in the end it can be seen that every one of them superhero or nonsuper hero gave it their all in this film and it shows one thing i wished was added in this movie character wise were some other antihero marvel characters such as ghost rider and the punisher i know they dont belong to the but it would still be fun to see them beating up the baddies tooas for the action id say that there definitely was plenty of it and it wasnt overdone either which is good too it truly is a sight to see how the coordinate their moves on how they take out the villains and its not like every scene was the same either every character had their own special moment to how they took out soldiers of lokis army the one that is the most fun to watch in my opinion is the hulk just because it is a situation like this where banner can run amok and tear apart anything he wants at any time the musical soundtrack was composed by alan silvestri which does not surprise me at all silvestri is good at this kind of material and theres nothing else thats needed to be saidthe only other flaw i have to confront with this movie is that the whole concept of allowing an alien race to come and take over the earth through a time portal is almost an exact replica to michael bays transformers dark of the moon 2011 even the flying behemoth gunships that come out of the time portal resemble the decepticon gunships too closely seriously who hasnt seen this whole plot device before but what makes this worth seeing is that the heroes in this film are not running from their enemies cough cough sam witwicky and screaming like a woos again though these flaws are so minor no one will really care or probably even make the connection there really isnt much to not like about this filmeven though it bares a small resemblance to other major blockbuster films the will hold its own as one heck of a comic book ensemble altogether the action comical dialog music and special effects help this movie excel to big heights that no other marvel franchise has achieved,fantasy
if you were into comicbooksmanga as a kid or like me still are you remember that feel you gotget when your favorite character does something just incredibly awesome like knocking the villains block offthat feeling is what this movie is built upon seeing your favorite heroes just doing awesome stuff upon awesome stuff over and over again the actings great the effects and feel you get when watching the movie in a theater is close to unmatchedthis movie does just about every kickass thing and more however this movie is no watchmen and no dark knight it doesnt establish a dark feeling and its far from deep storytelling and characterdevelopment it is all about capturing our inner 12year old fanheart and bringing them to light for a whilewatch it enjoy it,fantasy
this was an excellent superhero movie i personally dont believe that the rumored justice league movie of 2013 starring superman batman the flash wonder woman and green lantern will have an easy time living up to this film the special effects were great and the 3d was very impressive i think the hulk was an amazingly animated character and defiantly stole the show with his comedy action and overall awesomeness this film is defiantly worth the watch especially in 3d i so hope that there will be a sequel with many more heroes joining the such as antman black panther the fantastic 4 spiderman or wolverine,fantasy

ever since marvel studios started turning its properties into films with the release of iron man in 2008 the was always going to be the endgame in one of the most ambitious blockbusters projects in recent times fans have been dying to know  is it worth the wait in the thors brother loki tom hiddleston has set his sights on the conquest of earth and makes an alliance with the alien race called the chitauri to give him the army he needs to bring the chitauri to earth however loki needs the allpowerful tesseract aka the comic cube breaking into a shield facility loki steals the tesseract which forces nick fury samuel l jackson to reactivate the initiative uniting earths mightiest heroes tony starkiron man robert downey jr bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo the recently defrosted captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth the deadly accurate archer hawkeye jeremy renner and deadly thighs super spy natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johannson to stop this new threat they must all use their physical and mental abilities  and work togetherby allowing all the major characters their own films we have presumably gotten to know them so the film doesnt have to waste time with introductions and can jump straight into the action in the first 10 minutes loki breaks into a shield facility with plenty of gun fire magic blasts and car chases although an early fight scene involving black widow was a bit weak using too many quick cuts and closeups the rest of the action ranges from good to fantasticthere are three big action highlights a three way fight between our heroes a battle on the shield helicarrier and the climactic battle of the new york they are all wellshot perfectly edited sequences even though there is a lot going on like the helicarrier sequence in which many of the characters are fighting in different areas it is still easy to follow thanks to the editing skill the massive battle of new york has a very similar feel to the battle of chicago in transformers dark of the moon but unlike bay whedon knows the focus needs to be on the superheroes battling alien invadersas you fantasised about the are finally together and they all have great chemistry downey continues to show off his quick wit but tony stark has finally found a intelligential equal in the form of bruce banner both talk enough techno babble to put star trek to shame downey keeps a reckless side to stark as he tries to taunt banner into becoming the hulk stark is distrustful cocky and unwilling to work with others but he learns and when push comes to shove he becomes a team player who shows what a true hero isevans was an excellent captain america bringing out all the nobility resourcefulness and willingness to step into danger that makes the character famous he stills has his values and despite being arguably the weakest of the main four hes willing to stand his ground when the battle of new york starts he shows his leadership skills as he helps civilians to safety despite the fact he should be adjusting to the modern world he answers his call to dutyruffalo offers us the best performance yet as bruce banner making him a stoic and reserved character not the dower being he has been in the past banner is a brilliant scientist who is more agreeing of the hulk he offers some darkness as he reveals his past but it does not linger as he tries to be good as the hulk ruffalo gets to kick alien butt and provide us with some great action set pieces and he even provides a lot of comedy through this physical actions and expert comic timingthor does not go through any character growth but that is because most of it happened in thor 2011 it is simply a continuation of what happened previously showing thor has matured hemsworth continues with his grand performance as the norse god and even has an odd joketom hiddleston continues to show he is a great and compelling villain hiddleston keeps lokis oily charisma and the aura of mystery that his plans and actions are never clear until the last moment he has a bigger thirst for power and hes more menacing and threatening he kills a man in front of a group people just for purposes of an eye scan hiddleston offers a very theatrical performance and he more than holds his own with jackson and downey in his villainous deliveryjoss whedon was an inspired choice to write and direct because of his knowledge and love for the source material he was able to blend together the different elements seamlessly whether it was scifi technological fantasy or espionage and makes sure all the previous films were recognized the characters were balanced no one is sidelined and everyone has a moment to shine in some form the dialogue was witty with some keen observations such as captain america not understanding a modern reference and other instances of humour in their general interactions when the action was not happeningthe is a very entertaining film that continues marvels excellent track record in filmmaking despite the long running time the film is never dull and only people with the biggest aversion to superhero films would dislike marvels latest adventure this film has set the bar

ive been waiting for this movie since i was a kid reading 177 where theyre all defeated by michaelkorvac and thinking hang on theyre not supposed to be all defeated i was hooked on these guys since then 1978 i thinkanyway i was more than worried about this film because it was to be very much my film id invested a lot of myself in these characters i wouldnt be at all pleased if it didnt live up how awesome i know these characters have been written over the years the battles scars and losses theyve had to endure i thought it was going to be a kid flick pure and simple that it wouldnt round the characters personalities enough and the script would be too simple plus joss whedon was under my radar as a director i hadnt gotten into buffy or firefly and anyway lets just say i wasnt overly keen on the director nothing personal or derivative of his craft and skills but this was a boyhood dream taking form people i spoke with about it all rated him though so as per usual i tried to keep away from as many clips interviews rumours etc as possible i like to go into the show knowing as little as possible i only watched trailers anyway i went to see it in 2d on wednesday 25th with a friend full of expectation and dread heheh all i can say is whedon has made an movie we fans can be so proud of the dark knight for me is a monumental film and easily was the best supe movie project ever executed until now that is the best supe team is now all together in a live action film and they have been drawn together beautifully by whedons script the mind boggles as to who else they will bring into this universe respect is due to the research and his interpretation of how these characters work together he nailed it im not sure anyone else would have maybe not even nolan himself whedons view of them was almost exactly how i have interpreted their relationships over the years ive seen the twice now already and will probably go again before the bluray release that will be an occasion too im sure ive got to give the score a mention too its on repeat in my headphones at the moment because its bloody great you hardly notice it during the film because of the awesome visuals and dialogue but i recommend having a listen to it alone alan silvestri is a master of action cinema he did predator for gods sake he delivers royally here check it out i couldnt be happier about the when iron man came out downeyjunior was perfectly cast and to top it all a great movie was made i thought maybe it could be the time when a really cool movie would be made and so it has transpired a huge bravo to all involved assemble,fantasy
this movie is now released in egypt i just found out and decided to go watch this blockbuster as a big fan of marvel movies this a very successful blockbuster first of all you find the bond between these characters and how each of them has his way of dealing with the big event the actors played the characters perfectly each of them the old ones who are used to the characters such as robert downey and chris evans  and hemsworth and of course samuel l jackson they know the characters well they are the real characters on the big screen also the new actors especially mark rufalo was a perfect choice for the hulk which is considered very special in this movie and i can say he is my favourite  you will really like him seeing this interaction between these characters didnt feel awkward at all they where very convincing showing up and teaming up together with their different backgrounds and powers and directions it was a hell of a team up and cant wait to see them together again  the plot is great with action all the time and lots of humor in different ways its so funny having these characters having some fun as normal characters and my 2nd favourite after hulk is black widow with a great acting from scarlett and also loki was a hell of a villain chapeau for joss whedon the director for how he dealt with this bunch of superheroes and make them flow together perfectly id see this movie again and again,fantasy
 is a splendid movie and thats saying after having quite large expectations true i liked most of the recent super hero movie except iron man 2 which was a bust but excelled and outshine them all i feared that putting all the super heroes together would make them cancel each other out but instead it let them exploit their individual strengths for example iron mans sharp comments and oneliners are better and sharper than everbut above all is an almost perfect mix of comedy and action it says a lot when a movie running at 142 minutes never even feels long or have parts that loses tempo is a nonstop action without ever becoming repetitive and spiced up with gems of humor oneliners and jokes whedon should have a lot of credit for both writing and directing this with a good story but extreme care for the details such skill is rare and makes to an action movie masterpiece to mention a few details i loved was hulks punch to thor and iron mans nick capsicle of captain america i only frowned when the chitauris spontaneously died when their mothership was blown up felt too much sw 1 about it as they were biological creatures not robots but that was a minor point and the only i can recallthe casting is great and all the actors and actresses do their parts very well an honorable extra mention to tom hiddleston surprised that in my mind makes loki perfect robert downey jr for his brilliant oneliners and mark ruffalo that perhaps plays the best hulk everi have to think back quite some time since i was so fully entertained by a movie i hope sincerely there is a sequel in the care of whedon there certainly is an opening for it910,fantasy
there is one word that sums up and that is style and it has awesome witty dialogues that are funny as hellthere was always this fear with that it would fail to give every character its due but every single superhero gets time to do his thing do it in style and look really cool doing it the interplay between the characters is brilliant there are lots witty dialogues and most of them range from being very funny to being downright hilarious and there are many scenes that had the audience laughing really hard without intending to give much away there is one scene towards the end involving hulk and loki that may just be the funniest scene ever in the history of movies each characters gets his due they play off each other brilliantly above all the movie when it decides to get the audience to laugh does a hell of a jobthe story is one of weaknesses and it never immerses the audience in the movie and you always feel that you are watching really cool stuff happening from a distance the story which is quite simple really can be summed up in two sentences loki has a deal with some aliens that if they help him take over the earth he will give them a blue cube sort of a thing which is very powerful loki builds a gateway something like the one between earth and asgard in thor and the aliens arrive and the beat them and lokithough loki is the main villain and he does get nasty and clever at times he is not who the heroes end up fighting in the final battle a whole army pops out of the sky quite literally and while all along you are told an army is coming when it does arrive you sort of wonder who are they exactly consequently the army itself which in this instance happen to be essentially aliens from another of the nine worlds in the thor story seem very replaceable and it would really not make a difference if the army the end up fighting were huge giant robots essentially what the movie makers are telling us that now a big army has arrived and the heroes have a hard task and that isnt exactly great storytellingsecondly given the way this alien army is disposed off by essentially shooting them with guns and arrows you sort of wonder was this threat big enough to require the i mean the army or the navy would have taken care of it really in other words the threat doesnt exactly overwhelm you when it arrivesmy biggest problem with the story however is that when all the fighting is done there are no lasting impacts i mean everyone walks off as if nothing happened and things are normal the kind of invasion that has just taken place would quite frankly be one of those world changing events but not in the movie everyone just walks off as if nothing happenedin terms of performances there is not one performance which seems uncool everyone has they fair share of funny lines to say and look really cool and do things in style one set of dialogues sums up the final battle and it goes like this loki  i have an army iron man  we have hulkthis in essence is the final battle for you hulk is good enough to wipe out the entire army and really owns the final battle had it not been for the fact that the aliens were just too many in number and even hulk is not someone who can be everywhere the other heroes might not even be required so to give the other heroes something to do there are enough aliens to keep everyone busy and a nuclear bomb thrown into the mix however dont let this give you the impression that the movie is about hulk no its not its about the others as much as it is about hulk just that hulk is the biggest weapon the have against the alien army and he pretty much owns every scene he is in some of the comedy involving hulk is just awesome as well and let me again remind you not to miss the loki and hulk scene towards the endso in short the focus of the movie is not on an in depth story its purely about style the is a great example of how if you put enough style into a movie the simplest of plots can provide tonnes of entertainment i keep harping on the fact that is an entertainer meaning that if you want to have a good time you need to go this movie you will have a really very great time the story has its flaws but if you are out with friends and looking to have fun you wont exactly watch schindlers list will you you will go for something like hangover is awesome entertainer and right up there with the best of them and is a definite must watchlastly a lot of talk was on how the will compare to the dark knight and really there is no scope for comparison i mean trying to compare the two movies is like trying to compare an apple and a television set i mean they are so different to each other that a comparison is not possible the only similarity is that they both have superheroes in them and that is where the similarity ends they both are trying to be very different movies and to try and compare them is futileso go watch you will have a great time810 only because i cannot rate it 8510,fantasy
the movie is complete entertainer what dc has created with justice league marvel has answered with though wolverine is to be a part of marvel world as he has a complete movie franchise at his disposal we do not get to see him here the bunch of characters assembled for the group or rather force are so conflicting yet they perform good enough in the movie the sfx in the movie are good and not sketchy the character development is good especially of iron man and captain america the constant tiff happening between them reminds of batmansupermen ego battles the sequel is about to come guessing by the scenes after titles the 3d is better than the last 3d movie personally i liked the characters of tony stark captain america and bruce banner yes the hulk his comments in rage are comic as they are meant to be,fantasy
the titled rather cheesily assemble in some countries including the uk has been anticipated ever since iron man in 2008 iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger have all built up to this pinnacle of marvel movies the starpacked cast includes robert downey jr returning as tony starkiron man chris evans as steve rogerscaptain america and chris hemsworth reprises his role as god of thunder from asgard thor also mark ruffalo replaces edward norton as gammaray exposed scientist bruce bannerthe incredible hulk scarlett johannson returns as natasha romanoff aka black widow from the second iron man and jeremy renner stars as expert marksman clint barton hawkeye tom hiddleston plays villain loki and samuel l jackson returns as shield director nick fury cobie smulders clark gregg and stellan skarsgard round out the castthe premise of this movie is relatively simple loki wants control of the earth after the events of thor and will do this with the help of an alien race and the tesseract from captain america shield then puts together a team of remarkable people to fight the battles that they never could to quote the inspirational words of nick fury and to quote tony stark these are a demigod a supersoldier a man with breathtaking anger management issues and a couple of master assassins they must protect or avenge the earththis film was first heard about four years ago and has gained a substantial amount of hype ever since the teaser trailer in the summer of 2011 nine months and numerous exciting trailers and tv spots later it is here and yes it delivers very well one of the best things about this is the characters because they are all humans you feel for them and care about them and loki a fantastic villain played tremendously by hiddleston has a way of getting under all of their skins hence his title of the god of mischief the acting is great and it goes without saying that downey jr is amazing and hilarious as is the whole movie joss whedons superb script delivers many witty and memorable lines so much so that you will want to laugh out loud in a lot of moments mostly involving stark or the hulk particular scene involving the green behemoth and loki or thor are outstanding the action is brilliant as well and i would recommend seeing it in 3d the last third of the movie is definitely improved in three dimensions from the fastpaced exciting opening scene through recruitment and the manhattan carnage this is an exciting emotional funny and perfectly executed film with great cgi also there are many moments where you just want to yell out awww yeahhhthere are just a few bad points here but they are minor first i would have liked to have seen nick fury and agent hill fighting more in manhattan despite doing some things on the helicarrier also it dawdles a bit too much on the first half however this doesnt detract at all from what is definitely a 1010 motion picture,fantasy
till now the is the most spectacular motion picture of 2012 i doubt that there is any other film can beat that the soundtrack is beautiful the acting is welldone the directing oh my is marvelous i know joss whedon is good at doing teamwork films like firefly serenity buffy the vampire slayer etc but i was stunned when seeing thedamn hes that good containing a group of superheroes in one live action feature film is an amazing idea but make it work is a whole different thing and joss whedon just did that radiantly i am also keeping an eye on zak penn who wrote the script of the he had done an excellent job therewell i do realize that most of reviews on imdb have already talked about how wonderful this movie is and i admit that i am not as good as other viewers at this point so i just talk about one thing really got me in this movie above all those magnificent details about the soundtrack the script the visual experience etc one thing is very small and even not in the league of those really got me tony stark went for itwhat did he go for i wont tell you see it yourself what tony did in the had brought back the stark i knew in iron man 2008 and for me tony stark is the most admirable character in this film well firstly i like loki i still like him just love tony more cant wait to see him in iron man 3 which directed by shane black he did kiss kiss bang banglong story short ladies and gentlemen go watch the its worth your time people start to compare this film with the dark knight rises come on guys dont ruin the moment not everything needs to be compared the is wonderful motion picture so does the dark knight rises may be thats it accept it,fantasy

yes its a superhero super cast marathon insane cgi and production values at its best blah blah blah everyone knows that what people dont know is why will work for most and not for a fewi believe the real heroes of this movie are two guys joss wheton directorwriterscreenplay writer seamus mcgarvey cinematographer i have observed the movies which really work as an integrated unit are the ones where the director himself does the screenplay as a film student myself i can safely say that no matter how hard you try if the director and screenplay writers have two different work spaces unless they are people who get along on a very personal level they would never get it rolling on film thats why people like christopher nolanpeter jackson take their movies into outer space ok enough crap whats badthe fact that its another superhero bang bang movie with the typical marvel unrealistic non human plots the story moves in a predictable direction and the thrills were expected only well presented the fact that theres currently no spidermanxmen in marvels scheme of things will disappoint a few fans although marvel studios are onto sony columbia and fox to get individual character rights for sequels so surely a group of people will find it ordinary or not worth their timewhats goodyou will run out of answers when you think of could this movie with this plot have been made any better at all all the fan favorite marvel characters in the film are given as much character development and depth as a 142 min film couldve allowed while at the same time make sure the visuals make it into the trailers and get audiences rolling in the cinematography is fantastic for example there a couple of scenes where we camera are in the car and we see ourselves rolling and the action scenes are done so that you can registeradmire them properly michael bay should have a look into this joss wheton is top class all through classic big screen adventurefor the majority of the fans you will clap cheer hoot at robert downey jrs quirks dr bannerhulks smash comedy and will admire chris evans commands as captain america jeremy renner as hawkeye and chris hemsworth as thor the visuals are fantastic the plot is entertaining all through 3d is an added feature which i personally enjoyed tremendously if you have a group of friends to go with this movie will surely make your weekend,fantasy

so much to say yet so little space i feel like i am short of words today but after watching this flick in imax reald 3d i figure all of you would be as speechless as i am where do i begin where do i end the moral dilemma i am in to write this reviewbut joss whedon was one guy who knew exactly where to start and where to end in this marvel fantasy epic yes the marvel cinematic universe was already in place all the characters had been preestablished and had their own individual fan following so how do you get a bunch of franchises all into one just do what mark millar did in the ultimates vol1so you have a readymade script which you need to modify very little of minor adjustments to make the hulk look like a good guy etc and presto you have a script casting was never a problem anyway since merril lynch gave you 300 million usd to make this visual effects extravaganza the cgi was hardly ever going to be a problem with industrial lights and magic on your side but where whedon succeeds is the characterization every one from chris evanscaptain america to agent phil coulson clark gregg have their own screen time to develop their characters and story marvel has done this before in xmen etc but this movie just outdoes everything they ever made the brilliance of mrwhedon is clearly seen here i guess all those years of working in buffyverse finally paid off i initially thought it would be a tony starkrobert downey jr ride all the way i even wore my iron man tshirt as well thankfully it was not so everybody pitches in equally and its fun to watchthe plot line is pretty simple and straight forward a bunch of aliens try to attack earth with loki tom hiddlestone leading the way nick fury samuel l jackson tries to bring in the to bash the alien scum out of earth we all know how it turns out but its fun to watch it the way it happens the way joss makes it happen yes the final battle sequence feels a little star warsy and transformersy with the alien airspeeders flying all over the place and huge gigantic slug like creatures falling out of the sky but its still amazing to watch and is a visceral treat i just cant wait for 2 to come outhope they do the civil war storyline also by mark millar the genius that he is wondering where the confession part is in all of this well here it is i enjoyed it like a guilty pleasure for me it was revenge revenge on everyone who calls us avid comic book followers geeks or junkies it was a slap in the face to all the cocky bastards who criticized me ever since i was in sixth grade until now for reading comic books calling them kids stuff those same guys would be inside the movie screens this week watching the i am sure if they are not well the theyre even dumber than i thought this movie brought back my memories of being a kid with bronchitis sitting on his bed dosed up with meds with nothing but a captain america and iron man issue to keep him company of course i had the justice league and batman but since this is a marvel movie i will leave out the dc guys till tdkr comes outi am no captain america but i am a patriot yeah the movie released in india a week earlier before the us which was uber cool also bruce banner is on the run and hiding in calcutta so yes he speaks hindi also the end credits track is played by soundgarden chris cornell who happen to be one of my most favorite band of all time yeah my first love is comic books second is guitar based hard rockgo figuretheir lead guitarist is a guy of indian origin he is called kim thayil and he rocks hardso to sum it all up whether your young or old assemble your fellow go to your nearest movie screen and shout it out loud  assemble and make marvel all the money they deserve for giving us a fantastic movie experience,fantasy
the or marvels assemble here in the uk for ridiculous reasons is the long awaited teaming up of the characters from marvels recent and successful movies loki tom hiddleston returns to earth and steals the tesseract an energy source being worked on by scientists at shield in response shield director nick fury samuel l jackson activates the initiative and assembles a team of superhuman men and women that comprises of captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr the hulk mark ruffalo and lokis brother thor chris hemsworth who join shield agents black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner in attempting to stop loki from subjugating the worlds populationthere was always the danger that things could go tits up for marvel when producing a film on this scale and with so many well known characters and actorspersonalities involved im delighted to say that they have pulled it off and that the is a terrific film the plot itself plays second fiddle to the assembling of the team and i dont think this was a bad thing obviously marvel will be hoping for a sequel or five to come after the film so it was essential that the characters interactions and developments with each other were given high priority the sharp dialogue is thrown between the characters with more force and precision than a throw of thors hammer in the end the story is similar to every other superhero movie bad guy brings destructive forces to earth in an attempt to rule andor destroy humanity while superheros attempt to stop them in loki and tom hiddleston though there is a bad guy who carries great menace and feels more dangerous when he is doing nothing than when he is thrashing his weapon around i think that hiddleston gives the best performance of the piecethe time given to each character seemed fair and worked well there was a risk that this could have turned into iron man 3 plus other guys and as youd expect given his character traits downey jr does get more dialogue than the others but not so much that he overpowers the film captain america becomes the defaco leader of the thor has a vested interest in bringing loki to justice and while id like to have seen more of dr banner the hulk had the best action scenes and also the biggest laugh of the entire film scarlett johansson jeremy renner and sam jackson also have plenty to do it is testament to how good the film is that there are no characters who feel forgotten or underusedive said in the past that i wish action blockbusters would be more fun they always seem so straight and serious ie battleship but the is the most fun film ive seen in a long time the action was frenetic and thankfully avoided too much shakycam so i was able to keep up with it it is also one of the funniest films ive seen for a few weeks marvels films always have humour intrinsically wound into them but never before has there been so much and that its hit the mark so often i cant think of a big hollywood movie that has made me laugh this much so far in 2012as well as being action packed and fun the movie also looks incredible i saw it in 2d and wont go on a rant as to why but basically im sick of crummy dark 3d and it still popped off the screen highlights included the fantastic and believable technology used aboard shields ship and most spectacularly of all the giant centipede like bad guys who looked phenomenal the sight of them ripping through new york city is something that will stay with me the main characters design and costume were all excellent iron man looked even cooler when covered in dents and scratches and the hulks design is far improved from his edward norton days for me the best costume though was scarlett johanssons black widow outfit because of um well the the colours nice yes the colourmy only complaints are mild and that is that the horde of alien bad guys didnt really do much it was only really numbers that they had on their side another small problem i had was trying to remember where everyone fitted as ive only seen each of the leadup films once so couldnt quite place some people words and ideas those though are extremely pernickety and minor problemsoverall the is one of the most entertaining films ive seen in years and at the end of the day we go to the cinema to be entertained so what more can i add only that this film has become greater than the sum of its partswwwatthebackblogspotcom,fantasy
i have waited 4 years for this movie ever since i heard the rumour it was going to be madei had high hopes for this and was scared of being disappointed the plot was great to me there was no other way to group the together without causing a lot of questions at the endit had humour that lifted your spirit and made you enjoy it even more the touch of drama made me feel inspiredthe action was amazingalthough a lot of people criticise that you have to watch iron man 2 thor captain america etc to understand this movie i think that is entirely wrongyes to me watching them would make the movie a bit more understandable but not as much as others implyas long as you know who iron man thor hulk captain america and the other casts are you should find the movie just as amazing as i did even at that without the knowledge of the other casts just knowing those 4 characters would be enough to find the movie entertaining,fantasy

i am from india so i dont have much of the comic book reading experience which others from us have but ive been waiting for this movie for over an year now i have read so many reviews and saw so many trailers of this movie before actually going to the movie i felt like i watched 90 of the movie but when i actually saw this movie it blew me away first and foremost kudos to whedon for a wonderful masterpiece screenplay was extra ordinary and the way he put all those powerful characters in one frame was simple brilliant i dont know why but i always thought iron man will be like the central character of the movie but it was great to see hulk made a big impact than any other character i saw the uk press conference where mark ruffalo said that he was the first person to act both bruce and hulk it was simply amazing i have never seen such a huge audience and rush for a english movie in so long after avatar than ive seen today if you havent watched it yet do not waste any time these type of movies come only once in a lifetime,fantasy
if you are a fan of any of the marvel characters in the movie like myself you will not be disappointed you will exactly see what you have expected it to be in full length since the release of its trailer no more no lessevery superhero gets ample screen time and their interactions with one another is pleasantly entertainingthe surprise here is the hulk whom i think is far more fun to watch here than in his own movies accolades to ruffalo who did a great job with banner im not sure if he can be as good as ed norton in a standalone but as part of an ensemble hes perfect and i cant say the same with ed norton if he is to reprise his role here the cgi version of this hulk is also way better than his previous versions  rightly proportioned just the right tone of green and with an improved face that looks just like the comic version and even a bit like ruffalos simply awesomemy gripes with the movie though is with its overly simple and uninteresting main plot tom hiddleston is a charming lad but alas loki as the lone villain against such a powerful team is simply too weak and a nonthreat throughout the movie i never quite felt that anyone except perhaps loki himself was in any kind of serious jeopardy btw speaking of weak enemies how about an alien army more like a skirmish team on hoverboards hmmlooks familiardont they work for skeletor perhaps thats what the whole portal thing was about together it feels just like a plotline pulled from an episode of heman and the masters of the universe also if the alien mothership can be so easily destroyed who needs the just launch a few nuclear missiles at it as it comes through the portal duhaside from that there really isnt much else to complain especially with the understanding that this movie serves as an introductory episode in the forming of the team more than anything walking out the theater i wanted to see more and agree with joss whedon when he said the sequels will be smaller in scale by that i hope he means only the amount of cgi shots not what is at stake or the magnitude of the catastropheadversary the has to face since the team bondingfriction seems to be the true strength of the franchise leave a big chunk of exploding machines and collapsing skyscrapers to other movies please since we have probably all seen enough of that by now besides that it also needs to be cleverer and more emotionally engaging it will then be perfect,fantasy
the hype regarding the movie has proved to be just a fanboy created hype the movie is all style no substance and the best of the characters and the best actor by far mark ruffallo as bruce banner gets a backseat ride as marvel poster boy although better as sherlock holmes robert downey jnr tries to make it a one man show chris evans has grown as an actor he is no longer a sarcastic wise cracking idiot he is now the leader struggling to find his place in other words depressed ala kirsten stewart in twilight people that find the time to whine about the voices with regard to every batman actor ever gracing the silver screen will delight in chris hemsworths attempt at asgard as a province right next to queensland australia a more irritating growl hasnt been heard since christian bale took over the mantel tom hiddleston seems bored and irritated by the role which he perfectly played in thor it seems the paycheck was large enough to get him to appear but not large enough to make an effort hawkeye why even include him he is a character best left killed off every second week in a marvel comic samul l jackson remember him for pulp fiction forget him for everything else david hasslehoff has never seem to be a better choice for any role until it was announced that the ultimate fury would be played by samuel black widow wow more useless than the power pack less russian than the state of kentucky and more wooden that south african oak you should be thanking youre lucky stars that the nude photos actually leaked it gave you somewhat of a career lets get to the actually headache inducing story david s goyer should be knocking down doors at marvel entertainment threatening to sue them if he does not get his royalties cheque it is almost like they tried to take every superhero movie ever made and bash it into one script american city in trouble check everything falls to the front check the heroes do not get along ala fantastic four but love each other as they are check josh whedon influenced scifi oh check check and more check i am rooting for the next film to include a scene where kolkata is attacked or maybe even better johannesburg south africa the cap lands in hillbrow all of a sudden a nigerian drug dealer arrives aims for his head but shoots him in the leg they can steal another idea because plagiarism seems to be the only method they make movies you should have bought american just before he falls into a coma you get the idea maybe hawkeye stand on top of a tower in chicago or port elizabeth and a gust of wind takes him tumbling into oblivion where he belongs to sum up the story armageddon the city scenes every marvel movie ever produced steel magnolias and every david goyer script simple as pie give this a skip dont give into the hype that every teenager wants you to believe they are the same guys that transformers to the top of the box office while movies like senna drive rotted in obscurity i am looking forward to one josh whedon venture though much ado about nothing and i cannot wait for a stand alone film of mark rufallo as bruce banner,fantasy
hey guys ive written a huge review of this here is the first few paragraphs head over to wwwthecratcom to read my full reviewdisclaimer if youre anything like me you want to go into the as blind as possible i will try to avoid addressing the majority of the plot but when i have to clearly address plot points i will mark them as spoilers2012 is gearing up to be the biggest year in film ever with new entries into some of the most beloved franchises of all time lord of the rings alien james bond and batman it is a good year to be a film geek the first of the years massive releases arrives in the form of the sorry hunger games you have the box office but not the scope to join the heavy hitters the question everyone or just geeks is asking is this the best comic book film ever i would have to answer with an emphatic no this film is big huge in fact and it gets a lot of things right but i also think considering the pedigree and leadup to this film the should have been a gamechanger unfortunately it is notthe is the culmination of the marvel studios cinematic universe marvel has created a series of films starring their heroes iron man captain america thor and the incredible hulk that all coincide in the same reality just like the comic books this connectivity has been planned from the start so that when marvel was ready they could join these characters into a single film that moment has arrived with the the is primarily made for fans of these films if you have skipped the previous films and missed the backstory you may find that your enjoyment of this new entry is limitedthe plot of the sees the demigod loki the great snarling tom hiddleston planning to enslave the entirety of the human race minor spoilers after his exile in thor loki finds himself in a strange portion of the universe one controlled by an alien race known as the chitauri the identity of this race is inconsequential and it is revealed within the first few moments of the loki plans to use the chitauris numbers to achieve his goal of world domination once loki makes his presence known on earth it is up to nick fury samuel l jackson to unite earths mightiest heroes into a force capable of combating loki and the chitaurithe man primarily responsible for this cinematic interpretation of the comic is joss whedon whedon acts as the writer and director of the and it is far and away his biggest undertaking yet mainly known for his television work buffy and firefly whedon has only ever directed one other film the lowscale compared to the serenity marvel studios has a reputation of hiring risky or untested in big budget films actors and directors to make their films the recovering addict robert downey jnr as iron man the relatively unknown chris hemsworth as thor and the majority of these decisions have paid off gloriously unfortunately whedon isnt exactly one of them despite being an authority on geek culture whedons pacing plot and cinematic eye are good but they still leave a lot to be desired this is a quantum leap in terms of his career and whedon mostly steps up to the plate the would be a daunting prospect for any director let alone one with a single film under their belt whedon is largely regarded for his writing and in the it is very much hit and miss he nails the characters voices and his dialogue is mostly fantastic except for a few downey jnr quips  but knowing him id imagine they are improvisedhowever his basic plot framework is quite muddled a film of this calibre should function like a welloiled machine not feel like it is made out of spare parts to read the rest head to wwwthecratcom,fantasy
honestly i would give this movie 4 or 5 stars the 1 star i gave is only to average out all the 10 stars it got earlier is no different from other superhero movies there are a bunch of people with superpowers there is a villain who wants to destroy the planethe starts with the united states all evil powers that plan to destroy the planet begins with the united states and most of the damage is done only to a portion of new york and all the superpowers combined defeat the villain required amount of drama humor etc are placed as necessary nothing more somehow everyone loves this good reason to believe that paid reviews can affect the overall rating to a good extent,fantasy
why are critics digging this movie for everything good in it because its vice versa for every other movie out there usually critics bash movies for their mistakes a blind spots that ruin the movies why not here i can name over ten things that make this movie so bad comedy in the end of the world are you kidding me loki a villain for six people are you kidding me iron man is way too perfect as he is in every movie there is black widow is a pathetic excuse for heroine along with hawkeye who even jenner said wasnt good at all was the worst character of 2012 and yes i did see most of the movies from the 2012 area this movies is nothing but a generic version of batman begins and i say that one rather than nolans other two because frankly in my opinion saying this a generic version of the dark knight or the dark knight rises would make me go to hell for bad respect towards some of the best movies ever why cant marvel fix their villain problems mandarin was terrible in iron man 3 especially that terrible twist anyways i could continue but you get my point hulk had no veins this movie was cut from 3 to 2 hours and if it would have been 3 hours it would have gotten me to give it a ten out of ten stars sorry if you take this as a lecture im just listing why i did not like this movie,fantasy
this superhero flick may have looked like gold in the trailers and merchandising but the real thing is a bloated bland hodgepodge full of bad acting dull scripting and underaverage action scenes the only two good actors in the movie are robert downey jr iron man and tom hiddleston loki believe me i think the lego sets based on the film are more interesting and the mini figure of thor is better than the one in the movie because he cant talk hulk the actual green guy not the nerdy scientist has only a few lines of dialogue bummer i know i dont want to spoil anything else but dont spend 40 seeing this film,fantasy
nick fury samuel l jackson gets together iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to battle loki tom hiddleston who is planning to invade earth with a full army to rule the worldthis has been praised by everybody and its easy to see whyits great theres an intelligent sharp script virtual nonstop action incredible special effects and 2 12 hours that just fly by this one of those rare comic book movies where everything is done right its beautifully directed the acting is good theres nice doses of humor and refreshingly the characters do not get along at first so we can see them grow and become a team theres not a lot to say about this film because everything is done well just go see it and enjoy also stay through the closing credits for a very humorous bit at the very end,fantasy
ive always been a big fan of comics however i failed to like any of the movies that have been made over the years featuring these characters with the exception of batman coz i think all his movies is actually much better than the comicsanyhow now  back to our main title today the first i have to emphasis that i really like scarlet johanson but she is just not cut for these kind of movies physically and character wise the rest all sucks actually i did not enjoy the movie actually i felt even bored during it and did not like any of the humor it alsoits crowded and they spend a long time talking about technical mechanics and stuff in the dialog that you really lose the story in the middle of itother than that the music sucks the acting sucks and the only explanation how did this movie beat avatar at the box office is that this movie and all of the movies that paved the way to it iron man 12 hulk 12 thor captain america has all targeted specifically the teens and it was all a big very well planned marketed series thats all but under the big names there is really nothing to itno matter what i think everyone would want to go and see it so try to enjoy if yo couldmuhannad kalaji,fantasy
the epitome of hollywood prepare to spend the next two and a half hours of your day in a movie theater feeling as though you are on a ride at universal studios dont get me wrong it was extremely entertainingbut entertainment only gets a few points in my book when it comes to critiquing movies it is very predictable and follows a plot line that a twelve year old could have come up with no disrespect to any fans but it was extremely cheesy who would have thought that the incredible hulk was so strong i wish that i could relate to not only the heroes but also to the villains they are very alienesq and the movie felt more like transformers than anything else,fantasy
the incredible hulk was a really fun movie it really never captured the real incense of the hulk and focused to much of the character of bruce than the character of hulk but it was still a fun film my second to least favorite 710thor was my least favorite but thats not necessarily a bad thing it had good humor surprisingly good action but was executed in a really cheesy way the atmosphere was too open and never really entertained and moved like the others did 610captain america was a good addition it had a really great pulpy feel to it while the others mainly focuses on modernized aspects but the ending lost its steam and added itself to my list of worst endings ever in cinematic history 810iron man wasstill is one of favorite superhero movies of all time the plot was great the character of tony was brilliantly hilarious and the overall tone was exhilarating 910so my overall expectations were very high i kept reading positive critic review after positive critic review and people praised the film as one of if not the best superhero movie ever even surpassing that of nolans batman trilogy so as any excited person would woke up early took a speedy shower and jumped into my clothes i bought imax 3d tickets sat down and started getting jittery of my excitement thoughts went through me amazing best superhero movie ever i couldnt wait to see these transform and lie before me this was going to be the best cinematic experience of alltime bad thoughts didnt even enter my mind they werent even present at the back of my head this was it the lights dimmed the theater went quiet the marvel logo flashed onto the screen this was it now after all that big gigantic buildup you would expect nothing but good things but youre wrongi didnt like it its simple as that the strange thing is people around me found it fantastic like it was a modern masterpiece i found it to be extremely entertaining but that doesnt make up for the bad dialogue i found the dark knight to be more humorous than this the jokes were hitandmiss only a few scenes leaving a grin upon my face but the rest were so cheesy and so overthetop that i cringed in horror the atmosphere i found nothing in this movie it was surely style over substance so half the film is taken place inside an aircraft and all the actionpacked spectacle takes place in the last thirty minutes but before that it was boring i mean it and i thought this was buildup to an epic showdown that would redeem the entire film boy was i wrong it was cheesy dialogue scene to yet another cheesy dialogue scene it wasnt even trying that best and i found the entire film kind of anticlimatic the villain loki was so badly cast and i dont mean the actor that i found no tension between the characters and him all the action was alltogether fortyfive minutes that making the rest of the hour joke after joke that never succeeds at being funny and back to the atmosphere it was so clunky so goofy so offthe wall it had no tension between the villain and the the cheesy oneliners were cringeworthy and the final payoff left a bad taste in my mouth i predicted that the wouldnt find themselves in a dilemma and i was right they killed a few robot characters and they won how could i have not seen this and robot that sounds quite familiar the whole manhattan showdown that takes place at the end the only excitement the film consumes was so reminiscent of the transformers saga and robots are so contrived that the whole scene still came off a little goofyim really sad that i didnt enjoy this but the final big payoff wasnt anything new or special the strangest thing of all this is that people found this to be a masterpiece the film is placed in the top 250 which it only deserves a high six or low seven but if you enjoy michael bay films this is your piece of pie although it is messily put together 510,fantasy
the marvel comic book based films have made millions at the box office and everybody must have been thrilled with a number of the best superheroes of the series being put together in the same film and presuming you have seen the previous films with them it has been building up to this basically nick fury samuel l jackson director of shield is meeting some colleagues in a remote facility where the energy source the tesseract has been found and activated opening a gateway transporting the norse god loki tom hiddleston from asgard to earth he steals the powerful cube and takes over the minds of personnel like clint barton aka hawkeye the hurt lockers jeremy renner and dr erik selvig stellan skarsgrd and this forces fury to reactivate the initiative recruiting some of the worlds most powerful and special heroes starting with natasha romanoff aka black widow scarlett johansson she goes to find bruce banner aka the hulk mark ruffalo who is hiding somewhere in india for his scientific knowledge of the tesseract  no mention of the other guy while agent phil coulson clark gregg approaches tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr who also has technological knowledge  and his powerful mechanical suit and fury also brings steve rogers aka captain america chris evans up to date with the situation and he is still trying to get used to the modern world while loki disappeared into the abyss he was approached by the alien race the chitauri led by the other alexis denisof and they came to an agreement that if they got the tesseract they would help him take over the earth suited up captain america and iron man travel to germany where loki is meant to be hiding and trying to ignite and stabilise the power of the cube showing his evil intent to many people kneeling before him he surrenders though when they fight and catch him in this process though the villains halfbrother thor chris hemsworth arrives also transported from asgard and he plans to take and deal with him in his own way and this turns into a fight between him iron man and captain america but it eventually stops loki is placed into a cell designed to hold the hulk inside if banner turns and now with thor recruited as well the argue about how to handle the alien dictator and there is the revelation that shield plan to harness the tesseract to develop weapons fury explains that he heard about what happened in mexico when thor was previously on earth and that the attack makes earth an easy target and the weapons will be good defence for a similar attack and as the argument continues lokis mind controlled agents infiltrate the ship the helicarrier captain america and iron man try to start the engines again while thor tries fight against banner who has become the hulk and may destroy the ship from the inside and fighting with barton romanoff discovers a hard hit to the head will knock possessed people back to normal in the struggle loki kills agent coulson and escapes the ship banner as hulk and thor are ejected from the ship and fall to the ground and fury uses the death of coulson to encourage the left to come together work as a team and save the world they know that the villain wants to become ruler as well as destroy cities and using dr selbig he has created a device to open the gateway and allow the chitauri to invade and attack manhattan and it is up to captain america iron man black widow hawkeye thor and the hulk to save the day in the end after dr selvig is revived so much explosive fighting and a prevented missile blowing up in space loki is taken back with the tesseract by thor to asgard the go their separate ways until a new threat to the world emerges and the final scene sees the other meeting his master who turns and reveals himself to be thanos also starring cobie smulders as agent maria hill gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts paul bettany as jarvis sudden deaths powers boothe as world security council jenny agutter as world security council harry dean stanton as security guard lou ferrigno as the voice of the hulk and a cameo by stan lee the cast are all fantastic downey jr with all the quips evans as the sensible fighter ruffalo as the man trying to control his temper hemsworth as the arrogant warrior johansson as the confident female and jackson as the intelligent controller it should be noted that the title was changed in britain from the because there would be confusion with the honor blackmandianna rigg tv series and also there were small complaints about spiderman and wolverine absent but it doesnt matter anyway the story and scripting are very well made and what steals the show is the brilliantly paced fight sequences filled with the most spectacular and ground breaking special effects to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks invading creatures and constant explosions this is definitely one of the greatest superhero movies of the last few years a must see action fantasy it was nominated the oscar for best visual effects and it was nominated the bafta for special visual effects very good,fantasy
spoiler as i revealed the copied plotwhat do you expect from a movie with six super heroesobviously it should be better than a movie starring any of those superherosbut what happened in the is reverseits not better than any of those super hero movies pathetic a plot which is copied from transformers is disappointing because the audience expected something newthe behavior of hulk is a bit confusinghe attacked his own avenger team in the battleship like he doesnt know what he is doingbut at the lasthe is helping out his team like he can control himselfwhy didnt he control himself in the battleshipand a lot of unnecessary fights makes us think why are they fightingits so immature for the superheroes to fight among themselvesunless there is a strong reason and i didnt see any strong reason in majority of the fightsloki is a good villain and his performance is better than any of the villains so far expect jokerbut he is a god and god has awesome powersloki doesnt have much and is hit by all like anythingespecially hulkin essencethe value of hulk and loki has diminished because of poor directionthe plus point in this movie is thatwe can see all superheroes in one screenalso there are little bit of jokes that puts a smile on facesome people in theater was laughing like they havent heard a joke beforethe 3d effects was goodaction sequences was also remarkableeven though it was put in wrong placeconclusionit could have been made far more better and should have done it if there is this much of hypeonly thing that went wrong is poor direction that resulted in questioning values of some superheroesthe rating that i gave to wrath of the titans 7 transformers 8 transformers2 6 ghost rider23the75hope this helps you understand how i consider good and bad movies,fantasy
great anticipation great cast terrific writerdirector what could go wrong plentyi suppose the challenge of presenting the the assembly was a thankless chore so much needed exposition the marketing departments requirement to wow audiences the pressure in creating a summer blockbuster and thats the issue a blockbuster was concocted rather than a film with heart in the tradition of the marvelfilm or any film with damaged characters the first 30 minutes are a slog the last headacheinducing in much the same way the noisy transformers films were transformers action being the template for the coda ofmr whedon forgot to truly assemble these divergent superheroes tossed off oneliners do not replace or exemplify heart and truth instead we lurch uncaring between sequences this one belonging to iron man and captain america the next hulk and thor ms paltrow must have enjoyed a multi million dollar pay day for a few minutes of screen time mr hiddleston becomes tiresome in a onenote part in a lapse ms johansson bears no trace of russian accent guess rosetta stone should be congratulated the amazing mr renner with two pages of dialogue tops is simply a placeholder as is thor whose continuing grudge with brother loki is toothless missed opportunities allthere are a few bright spots mr ruffalo as both the troubled banner and hulk and the unforgettable mr downey whose attitude is enough as he delivers the best lines forget the rest theyre interchangeable and disposableyes it is fun and top notch in fx so what any big budget fx driven film lays claim to those same superlatives the result here is a disappointment maybe whedon should resurrect buffymaddeningly way too much but not enough much like the coterie of villains in spiderman 3 where peter parkers struggle to own his responsibility is lost in the noise mr whedon is not the first director to lose sight of story in whizbamboom and here hes not surefooted in the execution maybe ii presold with the skrulls will be better now that we kinda know more about these assembled superheroestechnically the 3d showed a few seams grainy and indistinct this seems part and parcel of conversion in post rather than in capturing in the formattheres no sense asking you to pass youve probably already seen it dissenting voices are few but please carefully consider before reflexively braying its great,fantasy
i must marvel the way the movie has been received worldwide our poor cousins in the us get to see it a week later feels good for a changecoming to the movie a wonderful ensemble of superheros out to save the world from a maverick god who is on the hunt for a certain cube with infinite energy source to make weapons of mass destruction with which he will provide humans freedom from freedom seems quite a mouthful thata gunfire underwhelming start with loki the god escaping with the cube quite callously provides us with the excuse to get the avenger cast together and so follows the tryst with good vs evil as one scene follows the other in mundane logical sequence the super heroes flaunt their wares with aplomb wit and humor coinciding with every innuendo in the action sequences robots mechanical serpents and the incredible hulka fun and thrill spectacle in spectacular 3d wow the popcorn felt great too,fantasy
i couldnt wait to see th i thought that it would be on the same level as the iron man movies thor and captain america sadly its more on par with the two hulk movies instead i have to admit that i am a fan of superheroes but i really wasnt into the as the cartoons contains too many whiny characters well the movie is no different there is too much preaching by nick fury captain america is too angry angrier than the hulk in fact way too much tony stark and too much exposition about science that we really dont care about the only characters that really shine on screen are black widow wonderful kick ass fight screens woman with power without superpowers hawkeye thor loki until he starts getting boring and agent colson joss whedon usually knows how to temper his characters better but in this movie he really put together some awful dialog yes some of the jokes were funny but in between there were long periods of just boring stuff its too bad i know this will make a lot of money but it could have been so much better it could have been a real classic but instead its not worth viewing more than once,fantasy
this movie is the worst movie ever made what happened to black widow make his own movie you know why women cant be not superheroes because they weak they sexier and they know is how to cook i hate marvel i hate marvel cinematic universe and i hate movies that count women as superheroes that count when iron man says to captain america yo captain how long are you gonna fart in black widows face because she is so sexy and captain says cuba i am going to cuba with meeting fidel castro and say how long are you gonna fart black widows face and enjoying havana cigars and pee his shoe are you gonna tell me about that marvel is enjoying his worst movies ever made just like superman 4 and batman and robin and when scarlet johnson is enjoying his farting hot tub baby,fantasy
firstly for all the viewers complaining who arent comic book fans and dont like comics what did you expect its a movie based off of some of the most popular comic characters in marvel universe thats the pointnow ill admit theres not a lot of surprise not a lot of twist or plot its a character driven superhero film not about the great twist or the psych thriller thats not its purpose its not meant to be a movie to make you thing or to shock stun surprise or terrify youwe enjoy comics for one reason theyre fun and good characters i mean think for a second imagine xmen without wolverine gambit and rogue imagine reading about hydra without captain america what makes comics great isnt just the story or even mostly the story its the charactersthe pulled together a great cast of people who lived and breathed their characters robert downey jr gets most props but i didnt find any of the to be severely lacking even scarlett johansen as black widow pulled the part off fairly wellso yes plot simple some might even say childishly so plot twists absolutely none worry about characters dying of course not theyre the good guys an ending we couldnt see coming nope everyone knew going in that the would winbut it was a good simple movie with great characters and honestly i enjoyed the change of pace this was a movie anyone could watch my 6 year old son loves it my 45 year old father loves it and even my 65 year old grandmother watched the entire thing with the family and enjoyed itso yeah if youre looking for twists plots that make your head hurt something that makes a statement or fights for a cause you will be disappointed but if youre looking for a good family film with great characters a lot of laughs some serious moments and some really cool gadgets this is the movie for you,fantasy
the only reason i walked into the screening because of its ridiculous hype even by the most trusted critics beyond that even the featurette or trailers did not interest me at all i felt like i watched something out of a kids happy meal and if we are going to expect movies like these in future receiving undeserving acclaim and astounding attention then i guess it is indeed an offense of naming and giving out razzberry awards as i would believe that there are movies with poor reception to be actually highly underrated the movie starts off with a lousy science experiment at one of the shields lab where a portal opens up allowing loki from an alternate universe to pop in and to begin with his agenda of destruction and dominance in response to the threat the director of shield nick fury opens up the initiative which has all the super humans or superheroes to team up for you know what the movie is a cocktail of a lousy plot poor acting except for robert downey jr whose presence in the film made it tolerable to some extent worst of all it was samuel l jackson in his role as the director of shield nick fury i seriously had a problem of tolerating his presence on screen with his unethical portrayal of his character he only wouldnt be the sole perpetrator as everyone elseexcept for robert again also portrayed their respective roles like they were starring in some sort of parody of the original praise would go to the visual effects and the action sequences which i dont think it is much of a giant leap for mankind in the present date with a good budget of 250 million well of course hats off to the animators and sfx designers who did an excellent job to save the sinking boat at least making it an visual spectacle the movie is strictly for kids who would certainly enjoy it so if you are thinking of spending some time out with your kids for the weekend  you wont disappoint them,fantasy
honestly maybe its better to go watch some cartoon series the or read some comic books about them then watch this movie so much flashing scenes flat and undeveloped characters dull conversions that after half of movie you really start think how can someone glorify this piece of cp only good thing is surprisingly solid performance of cobie smulders and tom hiddleston and really good last action fighting scene even if its unconvincing and completely transparent that i luckily didnt sleep over general observation was be that this kind of blockbusters must have really great and very well elaborated scenery that will naturally lead watcher from individual rampage to team assembly of world greatest heroes the earths mightiest heroes cartoon series showed how to do that in just 90 min hulk is completely lost captain america is to plastic iron man is working his daily shift thor looks like some intruder on private party and nick fury is completely clueless what to do but still everything turns up fine to funny and unconvincing scenery in combination with pail looking main characters can only outcome with disaster called the,fantasy
i have seen the twice now i really wanted to like the movie and after seeing it for the first time i didnt quite like it so i gave the movie a second chance to absorb myself more and found out that my first judgement about the movie was quite rightthe has some awesome special effects just like every other movie these days transformers battleship darkshadows etc there are a few scenes in particular that i liked in the movie   black widows introduction was quite amazing  the fight scene in the shield carrier was intense and amazing  the final fight scene is truly breathtaking and heartwarming too psstt you know what the iron man does almost the rest of it was quite formulic bad guy tries to take over the world brings the army are assembled and huge intense action scenesi really wanted the characters to interact with each other more and get to know about each others strength and weaknesses i also would have loved an intense plot with maybe a twist to surprise us in some way i am really hoping that they take the criticism of the movie made by the fans at heart and improve on everything what they did herei still have high hopes for the in there next movie and i am really hoping that i would get to give it at least an 8 or a 9 the next time aroundps i saw the deleted scenes of the movie they all fitted quite well and added more to the story dont know why they decided to take it out,fantasy
i didnt like the hulk movies they were awful both in story and execution ironman was excellent but ironman 2 dropped off captain america was entertaining if a bit far fetched thor was ludicrous i didnt hold up much hope for assemble but i still saw and enjoyed it even if scarlett johansen shouldnt be within 1000feet of these movies ever jeremy renner and robert downing jr saved this film renner is a top notch action star in the making that aside the is beautiful to watch great effects decent story but the ending was lame compared to the buildup and having watched how christopher nolan realistically and magnificently does his batman movies this isnt even a close second to them for me,fantasy

this movie was a good movie it had a good base but it simply wasnt this gamechanging movie that people seem to think it is its just one of those actionpacked nointellectrequired movies for this to be 34 in the top movies of all time is shameful im sure many people can think of 250 movies thatre far superior to this onethe acting itself was fine although it did seem a little awkward at times the dialogue did get extremely cheesy although it was good cheesy but good cheesy doesnt cut it in a 8 moviealtogether if youre looking for one of those visually striking entertaining movies go see this one but dont expect to be awestruck when you leave again good but not amazing,fantasy
i remember the comic books from when i was a kid a while ago while this movie is not perfect it does catch the spirit of the comic book quite well the characters are drawn like they are supposed to be because there is not a lot of emotional stuff in comic books except the love triangle of archie betty  veronicathis movie takes a talented cast and puts together the story of a threat from odin another world no less it does not really get to showing what odin looks like but it does have a couple of big time residents from that world one good and one evil that the fights center aroundthere is some light comedy which is always needed to break up the action a particular comedy blackout scene is thor and hulk beating up some bad guys then when the bad guys are done hulk and thor are standing together and suddenly hulk punches thor outthere is some confusion about bringing everyone together to wage this battle some of the battle sequences get a little muddy which is why i cant give this movie a perfect rating all in all it does well enough this marvel film holds up better than some of the early ones in that the action is spaced with pauses at the right times to refresh the viewer to me the original iron man had this problem so much action in the latter half that the mind went numbas for the women well tight leather on well rounded women always goes over well in my mind the only woman not in leather is starks girl still there is something to be said for the imagination a tight leather outfit can bring to the screen helps the pg rating too i was able to stay awake for this one which says something tooi will not id the entire cast here as that has already been done what i am amazed at is the way the movie entertains without 4 letter words much like the comic books of old this is very much the traditional saturday afternoon movie that a whole generation was brought up on before facebook cell phones and all the change took place,fantasy
the movie engages the viewer from a very strong opening sequence through the two bonus scenes included in the closing credits the nearly two and a half hour running time passes by swiftly and leaves you eagerly awaiting a followup sequelwhile whedon smartly recognizes how key downey jrs stark is to the story he also allows most all of his cast heroes and villain ample opportunities to shine both in dialogue and action solid entertainment and much better than id expected from the maestro of midcult joss whedonvisit httpbollywoodupdatesnet,fantasy
liked everything about the movie except the last scene how ironman happened to somehow fall through the portal before it closes too much of a coincident for a movie that has justificationreasoning for the entire story lineshould have been a more convincing way that ironman saves himself or by someone else feels like the ending was rushed i also expected little more action from thor but then again thats not a huge miss captain americas character should have been little move active as wellother than that this is how marvel movies should be made ,fantasy
the is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a magnificent cast this movie is certainly what all marvel fans have been waiting for its been building up since iron man came out in 2008 and despite all the hype it actually did not end up being even a little bit disappointing cast members reprising their roles continue to shine such as robert downey jr and samuel l jackson but even the new members deliver great performances such as scarlett johansson and mark ruffalo without a doubt the best bruce banner to date i hope to see him do a solo hulk movie soon it looks absolutely beautiful joss whedon was the right choice to direct it seemed like a messy concept bringing them all together and trying to focus on each character individually it would have been hard to make it work but marvel did it right an amazing ride from start to finish the is the movie superhero fans have been waiting for and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure iron man captain america thor the hulk and black widow are brought together by nick fury to form a gang to protect the world from thors brother loki best performance robert downey jr,fantasy
this would be a good movie to take the family to for a movie night it has everything you would expect from a big summer blockbuster  lots of eye candy with fancy special effects a simple and understandable straight forward plot the good guys and bad guys are well defined and in stark black and white so its easy to know who to root for and againstthe best part of the movie is the humor it has a tongue in cheek type style and there are some good laughs in the movie its definitely a lighthearted movie that doesnt take itself too seriouslyit loses some points for basically being too oriented for a kids audience it was not really my kind of movie because its almost like a disney theme park ride and simple minded in a sense its overrated for sure at imdb but not surprising many of the comic book movies are overrated at this site because of their wide spread popular appeal,fantasy
i went to the cinema by myself which i usually dont do let alone go to the cinemas usually just download them having high expectations but i gotta say i didnt get the thrilling experience i had got from watching thor or iron man oh wel i went to the cinema by myself which i usually dont do let alone go to the cinemas usually just download them having high expectations but i gotta say i didnt get the thrilling experience i had got from watching thor or iron man oh wel i went to the cinema by myself which i usually dont do let alone go to the cinemas usually just download them having high expectations but i gotta say i didnt get the thrilling experience i had got from watching thor or iron man oh wel,fantasy
rating see it in theaters rating system see it in theaters wait for the instant download dont waste your timeloki tom hiddleston the halfbrother of thor has returned to earth to pave the way for a wave of destruction at the hands of evil aliens but secret agency sheild has been preparing by analyzing the mysterious tesseract  an blueglowing cube of unharnessed infinite power loki steals the tesseract and it is up to nick fury samuel l jackson leader of shield to pull together a team of the worlds first super heroes to defeat loki and return the tesseract from whence it came the heroes are known as the and they are captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth the hulk mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy rennerthe is a recipe for disaster it is an ensemble cast of players each of whom is a third magnitude star in his or her own right whenever you get this many egos in the room at one time there is bound to be infighting and in fact this is what happens in the movie the heroes cant get along they jockey for alphamale status only to find that they are equals each with his own unique strength and yet both on the screen and in reality they find a balance each actor brings his own ingredients to the mix and each actor plays his or her character to perfection as if it were their own filmanother problem is backstory  there is a lot of it some of these characters have been brought to the collective consciousness in their own debut films of the last couple of years iron man the hulk thor and captain america if youve seen their films then you have an idea of who they are already the other two needed a bit more introduction and it was skillfully interlaced with the actionand then theres the problem of interaction  6 main players plus fury and loki implies 28 different relationships and thats a hard act to pull off in just 142 minutesstill writerdirector joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer serenity pulls it all off with apparent ease the story is relentless in its pace and still fills us in on who the characters are and what they contribute theres an amazing scene when the characters are at their lowest point close friends are dead the team is dispersed and they expose each others weaknesses the souls of our heroes are left bare this gives us nowhere to go but upand indeed up we go to beat their combined foe the team must pull together each member using their special gifts to turn back an invading forcebut as amazing as the film is there are problems the last climactic scenes are a series of improbable battles in the heart of new york city mind you these battles are carried out with much more precision than the garbage whirlwind of the transformers films but due to the pg13 nature of the film we find little bloodshed and a lot of tumbling skyscraperswhich brings me to the biggest problem i have with the film just how strong are these super heroes hulk besides being hulking is apparently impervious to direct bullet and missile fire captain america can apparently withstand the full force of alien hand grenades iron man takes a licking and keeps on ticking and thor with his mighty hammer seems to be able to stop anything but still goes flying when monsters whip their tails and for the other two who remind me of the professor and marianne from gilligans island  and the rest when there is a battle they are sent off to do reconnaissance or direct traffic lest they be trampled or crushed they may be more of a liability than they are worthfinally i want to talk about the unsung hero of the marvel universe stan lee lee has a cameo appearance in every marvel action movie he is held as sort of the progenitor of modern hero lore as such he is a special icon in the comic book and now movie realm all legends spring from his fount there is a name for that kind of hero  they are called godsso for outstanding story characters special effects and an amazing boot not even a reboot of a new franchise i recommend you see it in theaters,fantasy
its been four years and five movies since we are introduced to nick fury and his initiative and it was worth the waiti was a little concerned as my expectations were very high for this and usually im sorely disappointed when this happenswell they were met and exceeded its the film you were all waiting for the story and narrative go hand in hand with the other movies and even if you havent seen the other films its a fun movie on its ownthe great thing the best thing about the movie is that all the characters have equal time and story given to themgranted iron manstark gets the best lines and is the needle in everyones side but everyone is given something specific to do which makes them standout cap telling hulk to smash etcbut as always in films as grand as this you find yourself asking who was the best and who was the weakesthulk in my opinion was the best thing in this because he worked in this by not being too in your face and also by having the two funniest scenes in the movie one involving thor and one involving lokijohanssen is sadly the weak link here she is good but spends a lot of the time looking scared of banner the rest of the characters are good if not better than they were in their standalone film most noticeable cap whose movie was the weak link in the marvel universe more than makes up for that film hereremmer and rufflo are great additions and hemsworth is as good as he was in last years movieirts easily the flagship film of the year and the one to beat for sheer spectacle and anticipation and whedon has given us an epic movie which has amazing action a witty script and a lot of heartits fanboy heaven a crowd pleaser and frankly awesome,fantasy
just came back from the screening of the and i liked it one of the two things i was scared of is if the movie would give equal importance to all the characterssince this one has a lot of charactersmeaning some characters get under played and others get more time on the screen but that never happened the movie was well paced as wellanother thing that i was skeptical about is mark ruffalo as bruce banner i was kind of hoping that ed norton would do the character but that did not happen never the less mark did do a good jobso for me it was a 75 but i cannot give a 75 on rating so since the movie was good i gave it 8you for sure can go and see the movie,fantasy
the have been assembled and with great success marvel did all the forework flawlessly all the superhero movies leading to this 1 make sense now small bits in those movies are directly or indirectly tied to this one the director  writer joss whedon  did a great job with all the characters he took some bits out of the old movies and connected the dots brought out the best in each and all of the characters the cast iron mantony stark robert downey jr  he was  is and will be the best choice to play ironman he just takes the character to a new level captain americasteve rogers chris evans  was great in captain america is absolutely great in this one i feel like he can play any superhero he is just the superhero type i liked the old costume a bit better but this does not stop the cap being the cap thor chris hemsworth  the god of thunderwhat about that he feels like the god of thunder this time his swing got meaner  since his solo movie  and he swings a lot hulkbruce banner  mark ruffalo   the unstoppable force  the green rage monster  oh my what can i say here  mark ruffalo is the best hulk he ties the absolute hulk tvs lou ferrigno who gives his voice to the big guy this time  as he did in all hulk solo movies  cgi work on hulk is absolutely fantastic i feel that ruffalo plays the clumsy but genius professor banner better than the others before him  eric bana  edward norton  and this time the hulk can smaaaash  4 real  hawkeye jeremy renner is a nice addition to the team  he had a short appearance in thor before  i feel that he is a bit of an outsider in this one maybe not that much screen time but overall he just fits in nicely black widow scarlett johansson finally we get a peek in her story outside of the she does that catlike fighting that we loved in ironman 2 she has some psychologically gripping moments in this one that i loved even more than the fight scenes nicely done samuel l jacksons nick fury has a dominating presence in this one  we finally see the mastermind  spy  agent finally in work and he works his magic well clark gregg as agent caulson is back and he brings not only the comic character but the badass agent with a punch a nice addition is cobie smulders as agent maria hill last but not least tom hiddleston as loki the main villain  thors brother  hes adopted   he is the absolute villain played so amazingly by middleston that he levels the the other characters in each and every aspect he just balances the movie out  some of his scenes are fantasticnow to the movie  i guess i can call it the best superhero team movie of all time if u are not familiar with the other marvel movies u will not feel like an outsider this is a superhero movie on its own and a fantastic one the pace of the movie does not feel to fast and to slow either script and dialogues are all in place the movie has some of the most hilarious comic scenes ever put in any action  or even some of the recent comedy  movies the synergy between the main characters is perfect in any way some of the fight scenes will blow you out of your seats i had some moments that i really wanted to just jump up  or rewind and watch again every character has his moments  or a few great ones the teamfight scenes just take this to a whole new level the cgi and fx are just what we are used from marvel movies and even upped a bit in this one set designs and costumes are also high quality the design of the hellicarier the mach7 suit is fantastic i really liked lokis outfit as well sound and music department also did a great job alan silvestri delivered again the music really captures the mood of the moviefinally the pros the assemble cast the character interaction the hulk black widow interrogating loki the smaaash moments  a lot of them  the after credit scene the cons 1 thing  this is not a 3d movie  it has its moments but if u can avoid watching it as 3d u will not miss a thingrating 85  fanboy rating 9,fantasy
while this is a perfectly decent movie it certainly is not the 10 out of 10 some people seem to think it is worthy of a victim of the over hyped build up by the studio maybe to be frank i found all the themselves lived up to expectations but the overall storyline and plot was not worthy of the super heroes so many have come to love and adore the truth is that with so many central characters their opportunity to shine is limited no matter how well they play their roles the dark knight is in my opinion the pinnacle of the super hero genreso far and the doesnt come close sorry guys i know i will have offended a few marvel maniacs with that comment but it really is true if you look deep enough within yourselves the dark knight is one of the best films of all time the avangers is not plain and simple worth watching but not worth the wait iron mancaptain america are at least equally as good in their own right,fantasy
i chose to watch this movie because it got a great score here on imdb but like many others said that must obviously be fake paying people to vote or just paying to raise the score directlyi add a score on just 1 star to make the average more at level with what the movie deserves around 56 stars it does its job of showing super heroes fight with lots of special effects and nothing more you dont develop any bond to any character you know exactly what will happen and you know no hero will die if they did die your reaction would just be huh because you didnt develop feelings for them anyway,fantasy
it is amazing various directors or filmmakers in general were collaborating to bring together a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to this movie never have we seen a good live action movie with this many superheroes the only superhero movie better than this one before its release was definitely the dark knight but this is a film that is much more fun and excitingin the very first few scenes with black widow we understand the film will have a very comedic tone to it while staying true to the actionadventure formula ive only seen this film a few times but every time i do i find myself smiling a lot especially in scenes with my favorite avenger  iron man robert downey jr pulls the role off perfectly for every film involving iron man  even in the notso good iron man 3 if all this great comedy wasnt in the movie it would be a fest of eyecandy at the end and thats about it which is not what i look for in a moviein the scene where all of the are arguing with fury i feel like stark and banner could have accessed the information earlier and asked about it and in that way they could have avoided the feud all together but i guess this movie needed tension of some sort it is also a little unclear if loki manipulated their thoughts since his intention was supposedly to have the tear each other apart from the insideif people are going to complain about this movie being clich guess what  its based on comic books these types of films are meant to be fun and exciting even if that means reusing formulas for action films if the movie serves its purpose it is a good film and the purpose was to entertain,fantasy
i never would have thought this film would have been that good before seeing this film i couldnt have given a flying monkey about superheroes except for spider man and iron man but when i saw it a new world opened upi caught up with the rest of the mcu and i went to see the even more impressive sequel on its first day of release april 22 the action at the end was awesome even though i dont think it was the highlight especially since the chitauri were quite incompetent i was genuinely frightened for black widow when the hulk was chasing her and whilst the were arguing in the helicarrier i wanted to shout at the screen and yell get away from the bruce bannervisually it was stunning phil coulsons death was tragic and tony starks one liners were great ah finally someone who speaks english wait wasnt his first name agentnick fury was great you can see he doesnt trust the especially tony stark black widow felt a little too humanbut she fantastically outsmarts loki tony stark washis usual and the ending clearly shocked him the hulk was also great bruce banner embraces and fears the hulk hawkeyewas really cool but we see so little of him captain america feltweak because thats what he is next to some of the other but he is the honest man trying to do whats best he nailed the role so much that when i saw chris evans as the idiotic human torch i couldnt believe it was the same person loki was a really evil and likable villain only that he stops feeling like a threat once he leaves the helicarrier,fantasy
i dont know for sure but i have a feeling that the people rating such a great movie as this below 5 are mostly the ones who work for other studios come on guys i admit i am not a fan of other studios as much as i like marvels cinematic universe but poor rating just because you like some other studio or work for it is not fair for some people this movie may not be excellent i dont have a problem with that such people may not give it 10 stars but it is not so bad that you may give it anything below 5 no matter what your taste is to me it is the best movie i have ever seen but to those who dont like it cannot honestly dislike it below 5 i smell dirty tricks here we need good movies please dont rate a good movie down for your personal benefits,fantasy
this movie is epic the actors did an amazing job on all there scenes but i walked out of the theater satisfied and wondering where the mcu would go with thanos and the infinity jems this movie isnt flawless but it isnt horrible either the action is awesome especially during the battle of new york the humor is put into the movie in a way where its almost a comedy they put easter eggs into the movie that hinted future movies and the shwarma scene is just awesome but on the other hand there are some bad things about it i would have liked to see more heroes and some of the heroes to have been seen on screen for more than 1 movie i felt like we were literally just starting a movie franchise and now we are teaming up this movie hints many things but the biggest 2 are civil warcaptain america fighting with iron manthor captain america iron man fight and infinity warthanos infinity stonegems this movie finishes phase 1 with a bang and gets phase 2 off to a great start,fantasy
the is the sixth film in what i consider to be a reasonably impressive series of movies we start off with an intense opening that had me on the edge of my seat until the opening logo popped up showing its beautiful face the opening provides us with a decent explanation of who the bad guy is and what needs to be done to stop him in this case the villain is none other than loki whos popped down to earth because he wishes to rule it well if he cant have asgard theres no reason earth should be any different righti appreciate how joss whedon managed to take the time to introduce each member of the separately the dialogue between natasha black widow and bruce banner is a particular favorite of mine its fun but without going off track and becoming silly we see steve rogers played by chris evans doing the one thing he knows go to the gym to me its understandable to take out any stress on a punching bag whilst also probably being the only place hes familiar withtwenty something minutes in and we finally see tony stark and once again he shines his humor and wit is fantastic and he works great alongside gweyneth paltrow pepper potts and the lovable phil coulson clark gregg needless to say the acting by all is brilliant in this film no one made me cringe or hope they got struck by lightning just to stop them from acting which brings me to thor played by chris hemsworth the guys massive here and i totally brought that he was the god of thunder here his first interaction with iron man and captain america is breath taking and visibly stunning because you know every superhero has to fight one another this leaves me with the final avenger hawkeye jeremy renner boy was he wasted in this movie i dont mind he was mind controlled but did he really have to have a pathetic twelve minutes of screen timei would have forgiven this if hed at least took on the it would have been a nod to how brilliant the character is and would have been a middle finger to all those who thought he was lame but no i was not pleased with his offensively small amount of screen time im not just giving it a 7 out of 10 because of my issue with hawkeye to me it doesnt have that watch again vibe going i find myself ignoring the movie and going for something else to watch maybe its the humor that at times begins to irritate me the whole that mans playing galaga he thought we wouldnt notice but we did scene caused me to roll my eyes was it necessary no another reason is none of it really stands out anymore yes the action scenes are fun to watch but nothing in the movie really makes me go wow every time i watch it except the opening sequence im not saying i find it boring but i just dont care if hawkeye is jumping off a roof or thors sharing blows with the hulk needless to say is the movie bad absolutely not its a movie that is fun for everyone the acting is spot on and the visuals look stunning its just not my most memorable movie in terms of scenes and the humor isnt all that great,fantasy
i must say that the must be a must see movie for the whole family or with your friends if you want to watch a decent movie the shows the potential of growing bigger and better things and with this step in the movie i believe that no matter what they do with the future movies will come out better if not just as good as this one during the movie i was wondering where lokis scepter ended up because we dont see what happens to it after new york i would also like to point out thanos in the after credits and how they will eventually have a thanos movie with the infinity gaunt just like in the comics anyways a 910 for me is a pretty good rating for this great film like i have said its a must see,fantasy
such an amazing movie  cant wait for the next one  i have got to say one of the best movies ive ever seenthe only word i can think of to describe this movie is awesome its amazing work and everything i had hoped for and more its exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure that is great because so many of these characters are larger than life they have egos and the big guns arent used to working with other people or even playing by the rules stark thor and banner all work the other side of the fence so to speak then theres the widow hawkeye and captain america who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure they are all thrown together in a wonderful and best of all believable fashion again more than i ever dreamed possible,fantasy
josh whedon was very articulate in the way he shot this film i believe that with so many characters coming from different films that he did a great job of introducing all the characters and keeping them entertaining through out the film the acting was great and the script made the characters come to life i know that a lot of work went into the design of the hulk and other cgi characters and objects through out the film me as a designer myself really enjoyed the effort into the film that was placed keeping the audience entertained with that many characters can be really difficult and whedon did a great job with keeping all the characters in character and making the presentable in a good fashion to the audience over all the film was incredible and i enjoyed it,fantasy
i just watched the movie and dont have a whole lot to say except that i thought it was almost all style and no substance yes the picturevisuals was beautiful special effects amazing and action sequences engaging but ultimately for me at least there wasnt a decent story to bring it all together so whats the point also where is the real suspense in a fight when nobody can be killed all the and even loki were either immortal or at least seemingly invincible so after a while it felt like watching an endless fight that no one could win just a bunch of fighting and explosions for no real reason except to watch something exciting happenmaybe im a little critical and demanding when it comes to movies but if im going to invest my time especially when its 2 hours and 20 minutes of it i want a little more than what i got with this movie this was basically perpetual action providing mindless entertainment oh yeah and of course a bunch of beautiful people running around in costumes again all style and little substancefor what its worth thats my two cent summary hope it was worth it to youcheers,fantasy
who wouldnt be thrilled to see captain america iron man hulk thor and the rest of the gang in flesh and bones on a film for the very first time well maybe not all but for what its worth i was one of those who would be willing to do anything just to watch it because the waiting was the worst partnot a fan of either captain america or iron man but i was satisfied with the movie given the fact that the was gradually taking shape starting from the incredible hulk the one staring edward norton to iron man 1  2 and up to captain america and thor it was a long journey but the end justify the means and it was epic it was awesome,fantasy
its yet another glossy marvel fantasy which seems to divide opinion  so i think its one of best average films ive ever seen its entertaining noisy violent and you just know whos going to win mind you new york was left in ruins yet again the marvel plot should run that new yorkers should just leave everything as it is to save time for the next alien foulup can the producers reuse any of the cgi cartoon conflagration scenes to pad out the next moviebad god loki forcibly gathers a force around him in order to take over earth and get one over his brother the good god thor meanwhile in the growing chaos samuel l jackson is responsible for assembling a force of superheroes to save the planet captain america iron man hulk black widow thor and eventually hawkeye its a shame capt america didnt get his moments readjusting to life in the 21st century i mans slappable whimsicality was reduced hulk sure had some fun in his far too brief meeting with loki johansson looked just as serious and good with her kit on personally there could have been more room for character interpolations and plot and less buildingcrunching battle at the end but i suppose thats what appeals more to the kids but i must admit that in the thick of it i was wondering where was popeye and could he have polished the baddies all off a little quicker than this lot and fancy a future us government signing off the building of a mammoth flying aircraft carrier  with teleportation maybe just around the corner the whole concept of travel  and battle  will be altered i came away almost impressed at the style over substance brazenness of the film itself but very impressed with tom hiddlestons smooth performance as loki maybe an eton education helps perfect acting with a cold heartless demeanouri loved the aftercredit ending section tying back in to the plot and although if stripped of the cgi its pretty simple fare i enjoyed it not a bad nor a great film  even if compared to battleship but its barmy and just lively and fast enough to suspend belief for two hours and it does what it says its going to do on the shield,fantasy
this movie would probably be a dream come true for marvelfreaks i for one absolutely love this movie its action pact and full of drama with all of our favorite actors starring as all of our favorite superheroes not only are the good guys fantastic but also our favorite villain yes loki i was soooo exited for this film and was in no way disappointed the movie does not just offer you action but also a lot of humor robert downey jrs quick and remarkable jokes almost made me pee in my pants and scarlett johansson as black widow was once again incredibly entertaining best scifi in like a century this movie is guaranteed to impress wont be disappointed,fantasy
 is a movie that is must watch for everyone but still i dont get one thingwhy was all the plot so artificialthe fight sequence is beautiful and there are lot of awesome moments i just wonder if such a technology was used properly until the end the whole system and everyone seems to be just acting to support some story which was terribly boring none of the intelligent mind can grasp it positively everything was so much made up that it feels as if it was made just to maintain a length until the fight scenes can be filmed its terrible that the producer even invested in such a weak project the effect with hulk are the main attraction most of the characters in my opinion degraded their image as a superhero during unrequired fight shotsfor me this was a super enjoyable movie but i would love to see it using forward button i declare it as a forward button movie its is watchable and interesting but it is like why why why all this that is you are doingspecially that man with one eyelimit of a grown up actor to do some insane artificial acting and bring disrespect,fantasy
people think that the winter soldier is better than the so what i do and always will think that the is the best superhero movie of all time i watch it over and over again but i never ever get tired of it this movie is absolutely one of the best especially with robert downey jr he makes it seem that this movie is a comedy i laughed so hard the first time that i almost cried i especially liked it when dr banner turned into hulk and was shot by an airplane the bullets didnt do anything and the pilot kept saying target angry i also laughed when hulk went flying off the airplane thor was so dramatic but i could totally see where he was coming from you kind of want to throw a hissy fit when your own brother is trying to destroy earth wow the fighting scene was actually interesting and had a point to it unlike the winter soldier i explained that in my review for the winter soldier definitely not as good as the if you have not seen this movie watch it right now,fantasy
the has it all and then some six superheroes for the price of one ticket iron man thor captain america hawkeye black widow and the hulk its also the blockbuster i saw in my head when i imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the marvel world in one shiny stupendously exciting package joss whedon in his second film that hes directed stages the most exultantly goodhumored headon rousing series as well as some interesting character interactions and development between our heroesthe plot works in a simple way the world will end if loki tom hiddleston the banished demigod has his way loki hates his brother thor chris hemsworth and lusts to destroy earth with help from an alien army as head of shield strategic hazard intervention espionage logistics directorate nick fury samuel l jackson has one recourse bring in the a group of paragons with a rep for not playing well with othersrobert downey jr still seems blissfully right as tony stark aka iron man theres a disarming tickle in his portrayal he mocks the costume of captain america a canny chris evans and calls the world war ii hero an old man the captain wonders whats under that iron suit sparking a priceless downey deadpan genius billionaire playboy philanthropist but downey doesnt hog the spotlight hemsworths giantsize thor gets big laughs dismissing his comrades in arms youre all so tiny and everyone gets to show their skill sets including hawkeye jeremy renner the expert archer and natasha aka the black widow scarlett johansson a killer in gymnastics and martial arts johansson has a terrific bit dispatching some russian goons with her hands literally tied behind her back even phil coulson has a few moments here and there that really shine in the filmmark ruffalo is the newcomer to the team replacing edward norton and eric bana as bruce banner the nuclear physicist with anger issues that turn him into a hulking green rage machine while i did like bana and norton as bruce banner in my opinion ruffalo is the best hulk the reason for that is because he really plays the character like someone whos gone to hell and back again on a daily basis and that is how the character should be played as someone who is cursed with this power the computerized unjolly green giant is a jumbo scenestealer and its hard not to cheer when hulk wipes up the floor with lokifanboys here my roar this film is awesome the first two acts are built up for character interaction and revelations while in the final third when whedon lets it rip and turns the battle intensity up to 11 all your senses will be blown i have one word for the awesometacular,fantasy
 was completely over rated in my opinion and for many reasons the four main characters were great hulk ironman capt and thor but the rest were just there to provide filler and the two assassins hawkeye and blackwidow had way too much screen time especially blackwidow played by scarlett johansson she is in almost every scene and is a really poor choice for this role in my opinion i could think of a handful of actresses who are more deserving for this role than johansson and put that with the fact she is is the weakest of all the actors in the film and you really begin to grate at the sight of her as far as the look of her character black widow i would say she is no where near what she should look like in all of her fight scenes she looks non atlethic and you can clearly tell when the stunt double fills in for her her fight scenes were laughable and really brought the rest of the great cgi fight scenes down the second half of the film drags a bit with a lot of the chitari henchmen being used as cannon fodder for our heroes and are are dispatched so easily you would wonder why there were sent in the first place as most of them are incompetent or just plain stupid its a solid enough film just let down a lot by johansson and jeremy renner who was used as filler since the cgi fight scenes between the hulk capt thor and iron man must have cost a pretty penny and they obviously felt it was too much of a risk to over spend in case the film bombed its a pity because it could have been a lot better without the unnecessary padding,fantasy
i to be honest and say when the movie came out it was going to be a hit but now every time i watch it i see things that are so wrong with it like for example thor is a god which makes him practically invincible so that fight he has with iron man in the woods is redundant and makes no sense thor would destroy him only hulk could fight him because hulk is god like hawkeye and black widow serve no purpose in this film loki is done very campy in this when he should very dark destructive every time i see him i laugh and think how stupid you are hulk was ok i found the cgi ok at times but some of it was down right awful iron man was cool funny as usual captain america was boring to watch the plot of the film is laughable and makes no senseoverall if you 13 year old kid youll love it because you nothing better to do but as you get older im pretty sure youll the same as i do just give it time,fantasy
the falls nowhere short of delivering a fiery and action packed roller coaster ride of explosions the movie spends its time passing on the spotlight to each avenger showing off his or her unique ways of dominating enemies and overcoming hazardous obstacles seeing all of our favorite superheroes unite under one common enemy is an exciting thought and was inevitable from one day working its way into a movie having an army of superheroes to save the world from utter destruction isnt always a bad thing but for a film sometimes less is more while the offers many good fighting scenes special effects and cool futuristic gadgets that make your head spin the fundamentals of a good film are simply lacking the main problem with this movie is its plethoric cast of superheroes there are way too many to center on at once as hinted earlier the movie focuses too much on showing off each character one at a time constantly switching the audiences support from one to another throughout the movie there is a constant struggle for dominance between each avenger that involves boasting smack talk bouts and interferences pretty soon the audience is divided up rooting for their favorite hero and the whole idea of the main villain is dropped completely the story is simple and clear kill loki scene after scene however that mission is forgotten by two or more of the trying to display their machoness to one another unlike many great movies this plot line is drastically linear and bare to the bones in meaning in the midst of the film i thought i was watching an intense wwa match from the future six superheroes is just too many for one movie the filmmakers did a good job focusing on each hero but that is all they had time for i cant help but think if they only had two maybe three main heroes they would have had enough time to develop a more interesting and meaningful plot decades ago we saw for the first time great and innovative movies like star wars terminator 1 and 2 platoon alien and just last decade the dark knight all of these films were able to focus on several main characters villains and a storyline that were all intricately tied together and saturated with meaningful and thoughtprovoking ideas in light of the wide and warmly welcomed reception it seems that the standards and expectations for good films has switched to a more dry and corny interpretation all the truly has to offer is wild action scenes interpersonal conflict and imaginative applications of special effects these assets however are known for never having the capability of elongating a films success and keeping it in the fond memories of its viewers movies like star wars which originated in the 70s lacked horribly in intense action and animation but the qualities of a good story and its creativity keeps it so popular to this day other examples of movies that only glimmered for their achievements in animation are ones like avatar which was quickly forgotten because it lacked a fundamentally solid story to remember the is merely eyecandy that satisfies marvel fans and audiences seeking captivating fight scenes it is more appropriate to label this work a collection battle animated scenes rather than an actual movie,fantasy
it goes without saying that superheroes have become the main box office draw for todays movie going audiences from iron man to the dark knight superhero flicks seem to be getting more and more popular today than ever before a film about a sole superhero is one thing but a film about a group of superheroes is a whole different ballgame so when marvel studios the came out last summer you bet we were pumped to see this picture just to see what it would be like to see a group of classic superheroes under the same roof based on the end result its a safe bet to say that our money was put to good use there isnt much to talk about in terms of the story for the except that its the type of plot youd expect from a movie of this sort nick fury samuel l jackson the leader of a secret agency called shield initiates a plan to summon a team of superheroes to do battle against loki tom hiddleston and his army of creatures from another world and retrieve a powerful energy cube known as the tesseract among the superheroes that are recruited are iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner this teaming of the century must work together to put a stop to lokis plans to dominate earth the isnt a film you go to see simply for the sake of the story even if you did youd only be able to follow the very basic details as opposed to picking up the most minor ones so dont expect much here story wise that will blow you away dont expect much either as far as the other foes are concerned with the exception of loki the creatures that invade earth and assist loki in his attempt at earths domination are lame their cgi design is as generic and lifeless as any other ordinary cgi creation youve seen in any other sci fifantasy action flick in the past couple years these creatures are so boring in their design and personality that its no wonder i cant remember them over a month after ive last seen them this film is a strong summer entertainment and a fun superhero movie because the novelty of seeing all these superheroes in one place is present in every scene writerdirector joss whedon obviously loves these superheroes as shown with the care he puts into all of the exchanges that they have with one another robert downey jr proves why i think iron man is the coolest superhero in modern cinema today talk about batman from christopher nolans the dark knight trilogy all you like ill take iron man as played by robert downey jr any day why because he has the same amount of charm and sense of humor that was present in will smiths character from men in black 1997 the exchanges he shares with captain america and all of the other superheroes are very well done along with showing how egotistical his character is the writing that his character is given shows that theres more to him than just a hero saving the world one of the things that stand out about him is that he sort of doesnt give a crap about keeping his identity a secret but instead just simply embraces the fame both with and without his armor when a superhero does something out of the norm like that i find it all the more reason to admire the character i appreciate the little risks screenwriters take with complex superheroes like iron man since i know theyre trying to take superheroes to a whole new level and succeed how about the incredible hulk i havent seen the other films based on the hulk so therefore im not that qualified to officially state that mark ruffalo is the best film version of the hulk ever but at the same time i do have to agree with most other critics out there and say that its going to be difficult topping mark ruffalos version of the hulk at first glance you wouldnt guess that hes the hulk given that hes doing his best to remain calm at all times but thats exactly why mark ruffalo was ideal casting for this role because he looks and acts like an easygoing guy when hes keeping his cool through his performance were able to become more fascinated by the hulk when he loses his temper in an epic colossal manner in short ruffalo handles his role of the hulk like a pro joss whedons passion for these superheroes especially iron man and the hulk is ultimately what makes the one of the finest superhero films out there with the its not just the cool action scenes that keep the audience captivated even though there are plenty of good ones here its also the strong personalities of these superheroes and the union of their clashing egos that keeps the audience satisfied with their investment into this film regardless of whether or not youre a hardcore marvel comics fan andor a hardcore dc comics fan the has pretty much everything you need to obtain from a superhero movie and then some,fantasy
the is one of the best films i have ever seen it is action packed thrilling and full of amazing special effects the characters are developed throughout the movie as they learn to work as a team the story line is excellent and the movie has you on the edge of your see throughout i saw this is in 3d and 2d and i have to say it is incredible in 2d but unimaginable in 3d i also liked the development of some of the less well known characters and links made to other marvel movies there is also a great deal of humour to add another depth to this immense movie all i can say is very well done joss whedon a veryvery good movie i cannot wait for 2 in 2015,fantasy
ok if you dont get it yet josh by gosh has totally hooked us up from the very beginning this film grabs your attention and never lets go gods from other dimensions aggravate the wildest earthling freaks available luckily amazingly powerful lads and some just good humans with weapons widow and hawkeye hulk rules as usual thor vs iron manvery cool throw in capnice thor vs hulk greatest fight ever cap vs loki hulk saving iron man black widow vs hawkeye sexy hulk chasing widow thors spiral to earth hulk abusing puny god all iron man sequences when downy didnt talk the new bruce banner is the best pure fan boy joy stanleerules fnord,fantasy
the best film ever mark ruffalo had some doubts but he aced bruce banner i mean the special effects were awesome and i loved the plot joss whedon combined the two best genres action and comedy and he made an epic movie out of it the type cast was relatively good my favourite character has to be iron man as of all his gadgets it was very clever how it began with the hating one another and then they had to put aside their differences and avenge humanity in my opinion the best part was the battle of new york i loved how everything flowed from one hero to another it was action packed and the film had a great climax it was awesome how in the credits thanos revealed himself a perfect conclusion to phase one of the saga i cannot wait for number 2,fantasy
this movie is an epic adventure for everyone if youve been waiting for a bunch of super heroes in one movie your dream has come true i was really impressed with the action in this movie i was also impressed with the background music as well the story to this movie was the way it should be and making loki the villain in this movie was the perfect choice this has got to be one of the best action movies in history it was also pretty hilarious watching all the reactions the hulk made to all the charactersespecially when he grabbed loki and tossed him like a rag dolli think iron man was the most exciting thing about this movie if you watch the extra ending of the movie you will find out that thanos might appear in the 2 that is coming out in 2015 it will also have you looking forward to the guardians of the galaxy movie coming out in 2014 overall its an awesome movie,fantasy
the2012 was an awesome movie saw it in theaters with my dad and my brother all of us loved the movie i liked the postend credits scene with thanos i hope he will be the villain for the 2 coming in 2015 it is my top 3 movies of 2012 it is one of my favorite movies robert downey jr as tony starkiron man was awesome 1010 on him mark ruffalo was a very good bruce bannerhulk but norton was better ill give mark ruffalo a 910 on his 1st role as the big mean green guy i like the part when hulk just beats the crap out of loki when loki kept on saying stuff and then hulk says after hes done beating him uppuny god it was one of the most anticipated movies of 2012 it was just awesome if you havent seen it then rent it or buy it on dvd or bluray just see it its awesome,fantasy
the first thing i have to say is that this is definitely a positive review the is one of my personal favorite movies i find the plot the acting and the action to be excellent i find the idea of a superhero to be at once romantic and enticing probably my favorite part of the movie was the dynamic and engaging characters loki functions very well as the primary antagonist showing his very ideological views early in the film a majority of the movie is spent focusing on the as people however all of them are extremely different tony stark iron man is extremely cocky bruce banner is quiet and studious and steve rogers captain america is the natural leader and soldier type of the group hawkeye and the black widow add another dynamic to the plot a large amount of the movie is comprised of the characters attempting to form a team which in the end they domy other favorite part is obviously the great action scenes this film definitely does not run short on the action when the work together they show that they can work very effectively as humanitys last stand the first fight on the flying aircraft carrier is nothing short of epic and it also shows them that they cant beat loki without becoming a team this teamwork is demonstrated in the final fight scene in new york city where we get to watch the hulk destroy hundreds of alien soldiers alongside the rest of thea new trend seems to have sparked up in the last decade or so live action superhero movies and superhero shows are becoming more and more mainstream and insanely popular every member of the has a blockbuster movie behind them captain america the first avenger iron man 13 the incredible hulk etc i think that we love these movies because it gives us a world we wish we had a world where good always beats evil where the heroes and villains are clear and where individuals can make a huge impact for the good of everyone i believe that the gives us this world and i love it for doing thatin the end i believe that the is a great movie josh whedon stan lee zak penn and many others brought us a great story about how super heroes are people too for me this movie has no major flaws the comic relief action acting and overall themes just work really well for me i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
to start of this motion picture is fun for basically all ages but is targeted at 1216 the movie as most of the comic book movies has a feel of immaturity and unbelievable feel to it but this doesnt take away from the movie there are a lot of jokes and gags in the movie but all in my opinion are funny and are not overdone the jokes actually make it a more believable story line the cgi used is of the best quality and is nearflawless the only problem is for older viewers is that it is heavily used about 75 of the whole movie is cgi so it can seem even more unrealistic the dialogue in my opinion is very well done and not as bad as xmen first class dialogue the acting is fair to good but as always robert downey jr steals the whole the direction in my opinion is weak and just standard industry i felt that christopher nolan would have done a much better job the story is clever but predictable the the whole motion picture is filmed on digital cameras and not panavision im not a fan of digital however this picture looks to be the greatest of all hd movies ever made overall this is an extremely funny enjoyable and well produced movie and is fun for all the family especially the younger generation,fantasy
full disclosure im a big joss whedon fan buffy angel firefly even his comic book efforts fray buffy season 8ive loved them all even so like any whedon fan i know hes capable of disappointing us most of buffy season 6 titan ae so i didnt approach this film without some reservationseven with the very talented joss at the helm of this movie you see it still shouldnt work consider the following impediments first there are too many characters involved six three sheild agents and one villain just for starters to do justice to them all second whedon has really only been somewhat successful on television buffy etc had more of a cult audience rather than broad mainstream appeal and less so on the big screen serenity was a flop third in the finished product there are a number of plot conveniences used thor is able to visit earth despite the end of his own movie making that impossible the hulk suddenly gains control and is able to direct his rage the alien invaders die when their mothership is destroyed etc and yet it all works and works very well indeed for that i give credit mostly to joss whedon surprise surprise who not only directed but also codeveloped the story and wrote the screenplay and also to the extremely talented castas a longtime whedon fan i can tell you that all the best things about his previous successes are evident here the works because whedon is extremely talented at writing for ensemble casts buffy angel and firefly worked because each had a large cast not in spite of that fact its the characters relationships that matter and the conflicts that arise between them even though theyre on the same side thus we get a fanboy wet dream threeway fight between thor iron man and captain america early in the film that is completely logical the tensions between the disparate members of this wouldbe team threaten to tear it apartwhich is why the spectacular action finale is so rewarding because its the fulfilment of the desire weve had as an audience to see these characters come together the best moment in that final battle is a brilliantlyshot sequence that follows one avenger to another as they work together to fight the alien invaders it isnt just great action its the fulfilment of their collective characterization the action has emotional heft not just spectacular visuals while none of the characters really have a major arc that would be too much to expect in a film that is as ive asserted fully loaded already they do each get significant minor ones stark challenged by cap to show that he can make a selfsacrificial play thor nobly perhaps pathetically still trying to reach a remnant of goodness in his wayward brother black widow struggling with the memory of atrocities shes committed nick fury desperately looking for a way to make this dysfunctional group come together as a team and so onand while we do get some early action sequences the most rewarding scenes leading up to the big climax are perhaps surprisingly in an superhero blockbuster the character moments as expected from joss we also get a lot of witty banter and great oneliners but all of that is in service of building the characters and more importantly their relationships with one another the actors deserve extra credit because in a film packed with so many characters and so much action they have a relatively small amount of time to make their roles shine several moments stood out for me the tension between governmentman cap and iconoclast stark stark encouraging banner to cast aside caution and contribute in the most powerful way he can and especially that marvellously tense scene between black widow and loki isnt it interesting that although we first saw black widow in iron man 2a film where arguably her character had less competitionwe learn more about her and what motivates her in this movie that has so much else packed into it full credit again to joss his fans know how fond he is of strong female characters shes even the one who really saves the day in the end we also get something else that whedon fans are familiar with a straightforward easytounderstand plot loki the bad guy wants to rule the world with the mcguffin er tesseract he can bring an alien army to earth to achieve that goal the have to stop him or failing that fight his army after so many blockbustersespecially superhero movies superman returns anyonewith convoluted plots its a relief to see one with such a simple storyother people involved in the film also deserve credit for its success seamus mcgarvey is one of the best cinematographers around and his talent is in abundant evidence here the special effects are extremely welldone and alan silvestris score is epic and stirringprecisely whats needed for a film of this scale all of their contributions come together in that thrilling assemble scene during the final action sequence when our heroes are standing together in a circle facing their enemies a team at lastthis is one of the best films in the superhero genreup there in my opinion with the original superman with xmen with spiderman in some ways it may be even better than those predecessors because as i asserted above it had so many more challenges to overcome to be successful it works because underneath all the action this is a film with heart with character with humanity a film about how seemingly incompatible

joss whedon and marvel studios have accomplished something that i never thought wouldve been possible i am giving this movie a perfect rating and yes im aware that it is not the greatest film of all time and i recognize that it is not without its flaws but it is a fantastic summer action movie with some of the greatest comic book action weve gotten so far in film and when you really think about a movie with the scope of the this movie couldve failed in so many ways but it didnt it amazed it was beyond fun it was an excellent finale to what marvel has come to refer to as phase i which means we can expect to see more story lines and characters overlapping in marvel cinematic universe and its made me so freakin excited to see what the future holds for marvels film franchises the movie begins as we see shield in possession of the tesseract from captain america experimenting in the possibility of unlimited clean energy unfortunately the tesseract has attracted the attention of loki and whatever dark forces hes bargained with loki has plans on using the tesseract to open a portal to another dimension and bring war to earth with aspirations of enslaving the human race nick fury and shield are in over their heads but thankfully the past year has introduced a series of superheroes that might come in handy in just such a scenario iron man the hulk thor and captain america but can these superegos work together toward a common goal without imploding on themselvesthe odds were against this movie there were so many reasons this might not have worked ensemble movies can be difficult especially when you have a ton of stars and beloved characters to juggle every character needs ample screen time to justify their existence in the film and give each fan a chance to enjoy a hero moment with their favorite character in addition to all of this i was concerned that the villain for the film was a weak selection loki was the antagonist of 2011s thor and while this is only my opinion thor was the least incredible of the first phase of marvel movies loki worked within the scope of that movie but i wasnt sure he could carry a movie of this size as the primary villain yeah i was wrong i thought tom hiddleston had done a great job in thor and he pushes his character a little closer to crazier here hes an ample villain for a first time teaming of these heroes and for the final battle he calls in more than enough reinforcements to give us the epic action we expect when you bring these four heroes to the big screen in the same movie joss whedon is one of the few who could have pulled off an movie as well as he did the man knows how to juggle a large cast and give everyone a chance to shine he even manages to give black widow a healthy role while bringing hawkeye into the mix somewhatif youre at all a fan of marvels movies leading up to this point im all but sure youll be satisfied with the one of marvels biggest strengths has been finding the perfect cast and directors to bring their heroes to life now we get a half dozen together at once robert downey jr steals the spotlight for the majority of the film but seeing as how iron man is the most established and a guaranteed crowd favorite it was to be expected chris evans continues to prove he was an ideal choice for steve rogers and chris hemsworth is still the perfect god of thunder one of the biggest surprises was mark ruffalo as bruce banner i was a bit upset when it was revealed that ed norton wouldnt be reprising his role and i thought mark ruffalo was an odd choice to replace him but man he was great seriously i hope he jumps into the character in the same way hugh jackmans embraced wolverine hes a great banner and an even better hulk easily the best version of the hulk weve had at the movies the special effects in the movie are great the battles are epic and we even get a few hero vs hero fight sequences that they knew wed be itching to see the incredible hulk battling thor im inon the other end of the spectrum my complaints are few and far between the movie keeps a great pace only slowing down once near the middle following the massive helicarrier sequence the alien menace i wont reveal their identity on the off chance someone reading this hasnt seen the movie yet were nothing more than cannon fodder at the end but it made for a fantastic battle other than that yeah nothing theres a lot i loved about this movie it was a great culmination of everything wed seen building in the previous movies the chemistry between the castcharacters was great with a budding friendship between stark and banner and a bit of a rivalry between stark and rogers theres a lot going on and plenty of action to keep the pace rocketing through the nearly 25 hour runtime the was a major victory for both marvel studios and comicmovie fans,fantasy
loki opens a portal to steal the tesseract right from under furys nose while converting two of furys sidekicks to his cause he plans on opening a giant portal so that aliens can invade the earth and he can become the ruler over earthlingsfury starts the avenger initiative get all heroes superheroes semiheroes together to save the planet even though his council doesnt agree entirely so we get the scenes of these guys being recruited for the mission as usual for heroes against their will theres iron man and the hulk and their normal selves some russian agent chick captain america and even thor shows upfor more than an hour they fight amongst each other as is required of movie characters these days but they do capture loki in the process oddly he seems to want to be there they realize hes up to something and the russian chick is sent to find out what that is it turns out to be rather underwhelming now lokis people attack the flying aircraft carrier where everybody is that forces these goofs to join forces and get seriousloki escapes opens the portal aliens attack ny the respond and have to find a way to close the portal but fury wasnt entirely honest with them hes up to somethingeverything goes pretty much by the numbers loki is the star here by far of the heroes downeys character is the only somewhat memorable one he manages to be a bit funny cocky but not too arrogant renner is pretty intense and interesting thor is likable the others dont do a whole lot jackson as always plays himself or rather a caricature of himself why does he still get hired the isnt as awesome as thor nor as awful as captain america its somewhere in between your standard summer blockbuster with serious cgi carnage a bit too reminiscent of some transformers movie we clearly dont need to see another movie with giant alien worms destroying skyscrapers please whedon did his work and saved this from becoming some crappy michael bay clone the script and dialog are alright the whole idea just doesnt work all too well for me all these ridiculous heroessome human others superhuman others cgi together at least when its all and said and done its somewhat exhilarating but about 40 minutes too long intros are fine but we dont need that much of an intro let alone the obnoxious bickering amongst the main characters,fantasy
for the unfortunate enough to have not seen this movie joss whedons the be prepared for a few hours of comedy and suspense a classic marvel film at the hands of joss whedon and youre in for classic superhero action humor and thrills if youre one for large character development going into the minds and psychological aspects of each character this movie may not be for youthe story starts with the secret organization shield experimenting on an energy source known as the tesseract before long loki who is essentially the main villain in the film comes to steal the energy source to raise an army its at this point that shield director nick fury forms thewe see a few familiar faces in the marvel franchise such as iron man the incredible hulk thor hawkeye captain america and black widow it feels a bit lacking for the amount of superheroes has under their belt but what can we expect without waiting another five years for each individual hero to have their own filmmany familiar faces as well as some fresh new ones come into play of the film it isnt the first time weve seen the witty antics on robert downey junior play the billionaire playboy tony stark and im sure it wont be the last as he pulls it off so well each scene with mr downey junior contains jokes and wisecracks at those around him such as his scene in the ship where he points out the man playing galaga in the background or jabbing at doctor banner played by mark ruffalo for turning into a giant green rage monster we see other major names such as samuel l jackson as nick fury scarlett johansson chris hemsworth and jeremy renner each actoractress doesnt fail to give good presentations of their character but theres always room for improvement scarlett johanssons black widow character doesnt seem as intimidating as displayed in her comic book versions but still a different look and feel for the russian assassin all in all the performance in my opinion was exceptional except for the few ticks that dont seem to fit for some charactersafter the initial formation of the the main focus for the next hour is for them to find their resolve and eventually gain each others trust using the death of an ally as a stepping stone to stop loki all their problems with each other were overlooked eventually the last half hour of the film was used in the fight scene against lokis army the chitauri and the in the end everything is about the way it should be for a superhero movie where the good guys win and another enemy ready to pouncein terms of sound effects and special effects whedon and the marvel crew knows precisely what it takes for a superhero movie were taken from a flying battle fortress to a ruined downtown manhattan under the attack of an alien army known as the chitauri the visual cgi is stunning and everything looks about as real as you can touch them although not quite as suspenseful as in theaters the sound of each punch background noise and even the clarity of conversation between characters give you a sense of reality and a feel for actually being another thing that was a bit of a personal let down was the lack of minor details if you havent seen each of the movies related to the characters in this one then youre a bit lost on each of the personalities and backgrounds of each hero each hero is given perhaps a 30 second explanation or subtle hints on their whereabouts and relationships before the film another such detail was the fact that in the end of thors movie the major issue was the fact that he could never return to earth again when making the the detail seemed overlooked with no explanation just to fit another superheroits easy to overlook the minor things to get the full pleasure out of this film its a classic good vs evil superhero movie that most audiences can enjoy you get to see your favorite superhero come to life again to take down another threat its very highly enjoyable and a good actionadventure film i would recommend this as a film to watch,fantasy
do you know what is better than one super heroes defeat a few enemies no well i will tell you a group a super heroes defeating thousands of enemies that is why the is such a great movie it is also amazing because it is the greatest team of super heroes every assembled not just by marvel but all comics every created this movie had a unique way to tell the back stories of the heroes instead of just cramming all that information into a small part of the movie and making so you only got part of the story instead they made prequel movies for each of the heroes expect for hawkeyes which his back story was in thor nick fury which back story was in both thor and iron man and black window which her back story was in the iron man moviesthis movie is what comic book fans have been waiting for for years finally a movie with marvels greatest heroes captain america the hulk black window hawkeyes iron man thor even nick fury is there to lead shield and almost forgot about loki which makes appearance as the bad guy like always not only does this movie have greatest possible actors playing super heroes like robert downey jr as iron man it has awesome special effects also this movie has great action scenes in fact most of the two and half hour movie is action but along with the action there is a lot of humor all throughout the film this movie is possibly the best super hero of alltime best because of the perfect mixture of humor and action that all movies should haveeven though the movie is two and half hours long which is a pretty long for a movie but it never seems like you are seating and watching the movie for ten minutes because it is so action humor and suspension if you compare this movie to any other super heroes movie it makes them look bad because of the great job the directed joss whedon did on the movie mixed with the brininess of stan lee the creator of the comic books making it a great movie for people of all ages also the studio said they were going to make another one a few days after it came out so i am not the only one who thinks this movie was great,fantasy
if youre a fan of comic books or superhero movies then the by marvel will surely not disappoint watching the movie three times myself i each time have liked the movie more and more compared to the blockbuster superhero movies that have come out in theaters in the summer of 2012 this movie seems to top spiderman and batman simply because of the cast of superheroes that are present in this movie this movie seems to put together the best of the best superheroes for a one big hit movie with the names of the incredible hulk thor iron man captain america hawkeye and black widow this movie compares to an allstar game of athletes in any given sport in comparing the movie to other movies by marvel this movie stands out in a good way this movie adds more action and more punch lines than a comic book nerd could ever dream of in terms of putting the superheroes together the does a marvelous job the is essentially a sequel to thor and captain america taking elements from each movie after loki gets exiled from his home planet of asgard as seen in thor after attempting to rule asgard he seeks out to rule again after captain america gets unfrozen he is seen working out when nick fury stops by nick fury is the man responsible for recruiting and putting together the at first things are shaky as the superheroes egos clash rather than mesh together this is easily done by loki shifting the attention away from him and onto personal attacks against one another by the the constant bickering between the superheroes could have a negative impact on the audience  but it doesnt diminish the movie as a whole in the movie the characters dont seem to have changed from their own movies although iron man learns the value of working with others joss whedon is one of the best directors in the film industry and this movie proves to be one of his best big screen productions this movie sets the bar for superhero movies as none in my experience of watching superhero movies has come close to matching it marvel and dc comics will have a big challenge ahead of them when they come out with new movies because any that doesnt match the would be a disappointment,fantasy
the since we can remember there has always been that one person who we always looked up too that person we believed was our hero the one person who would always run to our rescue whenever we called upon them it wouldnt matter what the situation was unfortunately as the years pass our heros change we become to know the real definition of a hero and our deception of them changes a hero which is a person typically a man who is admired for courage or noble qualities such as the character or characters in a book play or movie who have these noble qualities throughout the movie the we learn that being a hero is not the easiest thing it takes a lot of courage time hard ships and team work to accomplish the most impossible as we see when the heroic team iron man hulk captain america and thor is reunited on the ship for the first time tensions were high as we expected they all had a different plan and understanding on how to defend their world and to take down loki their inability to come together and be a team at first is a major factor is their main source of vulnerability and the outcome of loki being five steps ahead of them it isnt until one of their own is killed by loki that they actually become the they put all their differences behind them and finally suit up to stop loki from taking over their world the courage each of them has to sacrifice themselves in order to make sure our world is safe is indescribable the unstoppable force that forms when they all put their special talents and gifts together are unbreakable their allegiance to one another is their upper hand to taking down loki in their finale desperation is stopping loki and closing the portal the viewers get a glance at what a little bit of team work and courage and a passion for something can get you their team work got them to close the portal each courage is the reason they saved the world and finally their passion and pursuit to stop loki was their unbreakable bond formed throughout the movie overall the movie the was not only made to show the comic story of the heroic team stopping loki from taking over our world but also to show everyone what team work and courage can get you in life you dont have to be the smartest or the strongest but if you have a big heart and a strong passion for something dont let anyone stop you from achieving those goals even if it maybe you saving the world from an evil villain,fantasy
envision the marvel universe as a gigantic spider web at the center of this web where multiple independent strands combine lies josh whedons the marvel hits the big screen once again in this blockbuster of a film that unites six heroes to be the earths last line of defense against a common enemy lead by nick fury samuel l jackson heros captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson iron man robert downey jr hawkeye jeremy renner and the hulk mark ruffalo are brought together to stop thors adopted brother loki played by tom hiddleston from releasing his army of alien soldiers on earth while wielding the power of the tesseract loki plans to use the power of the tesseract which first appeared in the captain america movie as the driving technology behind the bad guys to open a portal that will allow his fleet of extra terrestrial militia to invade earth early on in the movie loki uses his scepter to take over the bodies of hawkeye and dr erik selvig played by stellan skarsgard who first appeared alongside natalie portmans character in thor so it is up to the rest of our heros to free their friends and defeat lokiwhile collecting our heros we see that getting them to work as a team is proving to be difficult on paper it seems like the initiative would be awesome but between starks narcissism nick furys secrets and the banners temper it is hard to imagine how the initiative could ever work the lack of cooperation between the heros purposefully adds to a more intense build up to the turning point in the film with the movie poster shot of all the heros standing togetherif you have seen any of the five leadin movies to the iron man iron man 2 the incredible hulk thor and captain america you might have notice talk of the avenger initiative in these films though it is most prevalent in the iron man movies i think marvel did a great job of taunting the viewers with tiny and not so tiny hinting of the movie before it came out personally i think that is why the movie did so wellit was the anticipation had by superhero fans for this filmthey knew it was a long time coming the only thing i didnt like was that spider man did not make in appearance while loki was trashing the new yorkers back yard other than that terrific movie,fantasy
from the very first scene the was exciting funny and kept viewers intrigued it had a very affective beginning which is important when trying to get people interested i think it did a good job of updating us on what the were about and where they come from for example they talked a lot about captain americas past which helped to fill people in that may have not seen that movie something else i want to commend is the lightly serious tone that was set there were very serious issues going on and like many movies the characters used a lot of technical terms that the average movie goer may not understand however they did a nice job of not making the film so serious they added humor in all the right places that kept the movie from becoming too slow the first time i saw this movie in the theater people were literally laughing out loud you dont really expect that from a hero action movie i was also very impressed with the realistic aspect of the film you could tell this was a very big budget film and not a single penny was wastedthe acting was top notch chris evans did a great job acting as an old man who was very impressed with all of the technology scarlett johansson and jeremy renner had a great chemistry that made their roles very believable clark gregg agent phil coulson was a breath of fresh air as he portrayed an agent unlike many of us is used to seeing he also did a great job of making a character that was easy to fall in love with which is why the wanted to avenge him robert downey jr once again proved he was the perfect choice for iron man aka genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tom hiddleston loki wasnt the usual villain but he did a great job finally the one that claimed everybodys attention was mark ruffalohulk he captured the title as most memorable performance by far and excited little kids and adults alikethe climactic fighting scene in new york lived up to expectations it wasnt drawn out too long and it kept viewers on the edge of their seats they even added another conflict on top of the conflict with the bomb that was heading for new york city my one complaint about this movie was the predictable ending im not saying i wanted iron man to die but it would have made the movie so much more realistic had he not made itthe movie had everything you could possibly ask for in a movie it had romance drama action and a ton of humor i give this movie an a and i cant wait until the sequel comes out,fantasy
first and foremost i must confess that i am not an authority on marvel comics nor can i tell you whether or not joss whedons adaptation holds true to the history behind each character what i can tell you is that i am a super hero movie junkie i am a sucker for enticing action sequences and if things get blown up along the way even better in the you get that and so much more the whit and humor behind each of these characters is spot on and i had no idea i would laugh so much in a movie such as thisif each of the lead in movies such as iron man thor and captain america are base hits then the is a home run while you dont necessarily need to have seen each of these movies to understand the basis behind the it certainly helps you not only get an understanding as to the characters themselves but you already have a feel for the tension and teamwork to come the only avenger who does not have a plausible movie franchise built behind them is the hulk i am in no way taking into account the deplorable 2003 and 2008 attempts at taking on the franchiseone of my favorite roles in the previous movies as well as the was that of agent phil coulson to me he was the heart of the team he unabashedly believed in the avenger initiative and with a straight face delivered some of the best lines in the movie while mocked at times its agents coulsons death that ultimately brings the unwillingly togetherthe first twenty to twenty five minutes of the movie are used as a set up letting us know that the tesseract an energy source has been stolen by loki brother of thor nick fury agent coulson and the black widow all disseminate to pull together the main players tony stark captain america and bruce banner with that the avenger initiative is an initiative no more in the remaining 114 minutes thor joins the action as well as hawkeye returns just as we and the team witness the afore mentioned death of agent coulsonits been noted that paramount spent around 260 million dollars to make the i have no idea what percentage of that went towards the salaries of the cast but it was worth every penny thanks to robert downey jr chris evans and chris hemsworth we already have a connection to the respective characters that they embody add to that illustrious mix of mark ruffalo scarlet johansson tom hiddleston and jeremy renner and you can see why i unabashedly love this movie no amount of special effects can make up for a bad cast and thankfully in the we never have to worry about thatpulling together all of the essential elements from the cast action sequences movie score and last but not least the writing joss whedon gives you the ultimate movie experience i have watched this movie at least fifteen times and never bore of it one would think that after a while the scenes would get methodical but i still get excited it helps that the score by alan silvestri sets the pace perfectly do yourself a favor and set aside a couple of hours and prepare to be amazed and entertained,fantasy
yes stan lee does have a short cameo role in the i rewatched the first 10 or so minutes after i had seen the whole movie doing so helps put the whole story in perspective the usa nasa and the world council are all interested in the small cube of energy captured at one time it allows a portal to a different part of the universe when it gets a mind of its own in the lab the mythical god loki appears with a giant burst of energy and right away we see he is up to no good if he can position the energy cube outside pointed to the sky his legions will be able to enter and take over the earth the main star in a movie filled with stars is robert downey jr as tony stark and iron man we also have chris evans as steve rogers and captain america mark ruffalo as bruce banner and the hulk chris hemsworth as thor lokis brother scarlett johansson my favorite as natasha romanoff and black widow and jeremy renner as clint barton and hawkeye tom hiddleston is good and sinister as lokiwe eventually find out after tony stark figures it out that lokis approach is to alienate each human superhero against the others divide and conquer humans are eventually saved when the six superheros band together and each uses his and her special powers to defeat the aliensof course there is lots of action much of it taking place on a very large aircraft carrier that can transform itself into a giant flying carrier then the final action is in manhattan with quite a bit of destruction in the end it is stark as iron man that diverts a missile with a nuclear warhead steering it through the upper opening of the portal destroying the mothership which was responsible for keeping the battle goingother key characters were clark gregg as agent phil coulson pretty cobie smulders dressed in a sleek black outfit as agent maria hill stellan skarsgrd as the scientist selvig samuel l jackson as facility head nick fury and gwyneth paltrow back as starks girl friday pepper potts overall a fine action comic book movie,fantasy
the is a dream combination of some major super heroes it is what you can expect out of a marvel comics movie it has some good actionlargely thanks to the hulk and a few moments that will make you smile few involving stark iron man however more emphasis seemed to be on these 2 characters and the other characters sort of fell behind the movie had the potential with so many superhero characters it could have done much more and could have been even better having said all this it is a onetime watch at leastnot enough to deserve an 85 thoughgood but not that great,fantasy
aside from the dark knight rises this was probably the most waited movie of the year was it the movie of the year no but it was still fantastic up there theres a not very certain rate of this movie but heres a true review of this movie the was not so good as i expected to be that i can admit but i still loved it i admired that joss whedon did a great job with the characters screen time it all had a balance so no character seems distant that was a very important element of the movie and they succeeded at not blow it up that was a great thing they did the is the reunion of marvels greatest heroes yeah unfortunately theres no spider man well hes probably only amazing for them and they needed great so this movie needed memorable action scenes well along the movie theres some great action scenes but they cant be compared to what they saved for the end it was almost 20 minutes of fantastic action scenes featuring iron man at his best thor captain america the hulk black widow and hawkeye the special effects were tremendous as they shoul be and they brought a very significant and pleasunt quantity of humour in this movie that was really helpful and enjoyabledowney once again suits up as iron man and he was amazing once again bringing to the screen hes amazing sense of humour and smartness chris evans wasnt at donweys same calibre but he was still solid mark ruffalo was amazing as the hulk his performance was very solid chris hemsworth fired some good jokes along the movie nothing more than that i dont appreciate thor that much scarlett johansson was amazing and hot here as the black widow which is a really strong character by the way jeremy renner was too distant tom hiddleston wasnt an amazing choise to play the villain clark gregg was great cobie smulders was a surprise i was seeing robin turning into a serious secret agent oh and l jackson was also great with his nick furyoverall the is a great blockbuster that didnt fail whedons direction made this happening so good of course the story isnt amazing they didnt care about an amazing story only the union of these heroes but the is not a perfect fairy tale it also has its flaws like the long second act that was mostly placed at a submarine and weird enemies that bored he viewer when shown but aside from that the is a fantastic movie that succeeds at uniting all these heroes together amazingly it was amazing to seem all work together the is not easily forgotten highly recommended oh and by the way geeks this is the new geek porn,fantasy
this film was awesome the plot is simplistic and easy for the audience to follow theres a small box that can destroy the world loki gets the box and tools to do this shield set up a team to stop loki awesome fight scene involving robot aliens roll creditsthe characters are fun the story flows well the action scenes were done brilliantly the acting was top notch and the jokes werent forced great not one major thing was done wrong if you want complex story lines impressive story arcs and the gritty and realistic this is not for you if you want that watch the nolan batman films if you want excitement fun and alien armies taking over new york this is the film for you,fantasy
before watching the i watched thor iron man iron man 2 the incredible hulk and captain america the first avenger its not required to watch these movies before watching the nonetheless i watched in order to get familiar with those superheros and get the idea where they come from after watching the im thoroughly satisfied and i can guarantee that this film is the best of those movies i mentioned every moment of this film is quite enjoyable i liked every dialog of robert iron man actions are elegant everything seemed perfect one thing id like to mention that in this movie i missed edward norton as the character of hulk however mark ruffalo hulk did great job i admirei like the expression of tom hiddleston loki in this film but not in thor of course he did better in this film than in thor after all this is one the best action scifi movies i have ever seen in my life,fantasy
when it came to super hero movies before this i thought thatd id only watch super hero movies just for fun with my family not even the dark knight as great a movie as it is got me so excited after seeing it but after watching just a couple of the avenger movies leading up before this i had one thing to say going into this movie totally worth it the special effects were awesome the action was the best ive seen and the cast really did a great job but i think what really made the movie were the jokes dont worry i wont spoil anything the only reason im giving this 910 is because i feel the story could of gone a little deeper but thats just my opinion im just the type of guy that likes long and deep story lines i guess and if you havent seen this movie yet because youre afraid youll be disappointed for some reason dont be just remember totally worth it,fantasy
it is just amazing how this man mr whedon turns anything into gold although there were some restrains and limits given characters and all to this story mr whedon and all literally everybody involved in production of this movie gave their best and made it one of the best american movies in many years it is however a tough job to keep everything in balance superheroes and other childish and trivial stuff producers requests but despite of it mr whedon did it again and exceeded by far all my expectations i must note that he is at his best when his hands are not tied firefly  serenity or hush from buffy for example and hes given full creative freedom but this movie is really something else ive watched all the movies with separate characters involved thor captain america hulk and so on and they were surprisingly good although main characters only here gave their best but this amazing so witty so fun so close to reality making sense as it can possibly be so full of those details that make your eyes sparkle and your brain filling with serotonin mr whedon knows how to pull out the best from anybody hes working with such a rare and precious gift and so not hollywood maybe thats why he is so damn underestimated by hollywoods and television mainstreamnot only highly recommended but a must see again and again,fantasy
brilliant luckily i was able to take my tweens to this movie to a packed house on opening night this is now their favorite movierarely have i been to a film in recent years that has the audience cheering and clapping as the closing credits start and this is one of them from start to finish it is well playedwell paced and spectacular to watchthe movie begins where last years captain america and thor left off with thors brother loki playing the villain a lot of super herooccasionally physics defying action ensues as the team is brought together as well as some well placed humormarvel studios will have a hard task improving on this and already my 11 year old wants to see it again i had so much fun watching this one i wouldnt mind seeing it again myselfgo see ityou wont be disappointed,fantasy
lets be honest this could have been one of the biggest disasters in short history of marvel film studios too many characters an untested for blockbusters at least director a raft of egos a film packed full of cgi effect heavy action it could have been shudder another transformers 2 or worse even transformers 3 and with any other studio it probably would have been thank god then that marvel have once again proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that when they bring their a game few others can come close marvel have been on a rare run of form that has seen iron man thor captain america and too a lesser extent iron man 2 all become both critical and commercial successes across the globe its fair to say then that the had some rather large shoes to fill well fear not as marvel and serenity director whedon deliver what is probably their best film yet the in short rocks the story after a familiar villain returns from exile with an army of disposable bad guys in tow shield boss nick fury samuel l jackson has to do the unthinkable get a disparate bunch of superheroes to work together to protect the earth from an seemingly unstoppable invasion queue the arrival of the cocky iron man buff demi god thor man out of time captain america and sometime hulk bruce banner along side shield mainstays and as yet without their own solo movies hawkeye  black widow yes the story is as simple as that but in honesty the why is almost less important than the how because lokis army never really feel like the insurmountable threat they are billed as and therefore the danger at the heart of the film just doesnt exist but its wheldons handling of his trademark character interplay never more importantly mastered that it is here that really makes the stand out from the crowdsee because if you didnt know and if you didnt know where the hell have you been over the past 10 years and what the heck have you been watching writer  director joss whedon was the creator of tv gold such as buffy firefly and dollhouse not to mention a host of rewrite credits including films like toy story he became renowned for his expertly drawn three dimensional characters sparking writing and groundbreaking story ideas so its no surprise that the character interplay is by far the strongest part of the in part that is because wheldons script delivers  pathos humor dread often in the same scene that said if any part of this film would work it was always going to be the script but it would be nothing without the top notch cast all delivering their a game as usual downey jr shines as the ever humorous tony stark  but evans hemsworth and ruffalo all more than hold their own and naturally sam jackson could be cool reading from the phone booth this film was always going to rely on the balance of these characters potentially the films biggest downfall as it turns out its actually the strongest asset even adding the yet only glimpsed at hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson doesnt leave anyone short changed finding enough space to make these characters feel fully drawn watching the and seeing what wheldon has achieved i honestly doubt if there is a director in hollywood today who could have managed to balance the ensemble cast as well as he does thats not to say the action isnt good far from it wheldon puts together some of the best action seen in a blockbuster for some time well shot expertly paced and best of all it isnt edited in that hyper kinetic super quick style that has plagued action films since bourne  bay hit he scene but best of all because these are characters you care about of actually care about what happens in the action scenes these arent faceless robots or badly drawn planks of wood these feel like real albeit super powered whether its the hulk smashing thor through the bowls of the shield super ship or iron man blowing bad guys out of the sky the action is clear and often breathtaking villain duties fall to thor bad guy loki is there to provide the films big bad and is played with relish by the always brilliant tom hiddleston cocky arrogant and dangerous lokis interplay with black widow iron man  hulk lead to some of the films best and often funniest moments does it have faults of course it does the first hour takes a while to get going mistakenly leading me to think i may not have been blown away by the film lokis army are a bit meh lacking in reason or real threat with their own power coming in numbers rather than skill and i would have liked to see a little more of thor but these are pretty small issues in what is for allintense and purpose is one hell of an film oh and it would be remiss not to mention that finally after two previously flawed attempts someone has finally gotten the hulk right less conflicted then weve seen before ruffalo brings a likable but suitably dark edge to a banner and when hulk finally does smash he does so better than ever so a great script a superb cast some of the best action we have seen on the big screen for some time the is probably one of the top 3 superherocomic book movies ever made all this from a filmmaker who has been mostly ignored or abused by hollywood for he past decade in joss we geeks have always trusted and now secret is out wwwthefilmpodcastcouk,fantasy
in a nutshell the is a high standard movie which took a prodction time of 2 and half years the viewer will follow the earth mightest heroes on their quest vs the antagonist loki and his army of aliens who want to capture the earth however they underestimate the power of the super heroes and have to battle first the characters are really good and show their own individual purposes why they are fighting against the injustice of course the are many problems when you are put in a group of other guy who are as epic as you so the viewer will see how the character will go trough their confrontations with the others but they can only win if they work in a team which happens in the climax to sum it up  sfx 1010character design  1010story 710screenplay and acting style  1010extra points  very nice placed humor 910total  92,fantasy
after a long time of waiting finally the is released i have waited for this movie from last 3 years iron man series is one of my favorite superhero series and i love to see every movie in which iron man was there so after long time i went to cinema hall with my cousin and watched the assemble of 4 superhero hulk thor iron man captain america to save the world with help of director nick fury and his agents black widow and hawkeyeas movies starts it is more concentrated to storytelling and linking of the previous movies ironman 2 captain america the first avenger thor and hulk the first half part is about summoned of these superheroes another part is packed with superb visual effects and sound effects also dialogs are awesome especially iron mans dialogs are hilarious and quick wittedthe movie is well balanced with story and action scenes some movies are failed to adopt this phenomenon such as transformers 3 dark side of moon and ghost rider 2 spirit of vengeance these movies are concentrated to only special effects and lacked in story whereas the has overcome from this a mention about phase 2 sounds like a another part of the that is part 2 this is one of the best action movie watch it in theater that would be better than home so go to cinema hall spend money its worth it,fantasy
the reviewon friday 27042012 i dressed myself with my captain america tshirt and went to watch the in 3d i was really excited and the movie was mindblowing i was expecting this movie to be good but not as great as it was i can still criticize it a bit i think that the way the characters were introduced was mostly good but i think that the iron man introduction was not the best i think they shouldnt showed iron man in his suit for those viewers who havent watched any of the earlier iron man movies it would have been better if we saw tony starkiron man without his suit i think its important that people who doesnt know the characters get to know the human inside the suit that isnt much of a problem from me who have seen iron man and iron man 2 this is just something which could have been a little bit better for those who have not seen any iron man movie this movie is better than all the transformers movies but the same thing is repeated here the thing that im talking about is that a kid is talking about what he saw and he thinks its super cool and awesome ive seen this in many movies before and i dont like it much in reality it would have most likely have been considered a serious and dangerous incident i dont think any kid would have reacted that way because kids are smart enough to understand that what was happening was really dangerous in this story new york is being attacked from a different place in the universe they get there through a portal that loki opened for them in this story everybody should still have been shocked after they won the war i really dont think there would be anyone who was talking about it being cool there is one woman who reacts in a much more realistic way she was very thankful for captain america and the saving her and them all that is realistic they should all be thankful but not talking about it like it was being an action movie what i mean is that in that situation a kid would be thankful and not talking about how awesome it was in this story it was real and then i think its weird that the kid is talking about it like it was an action movie i know that this is a movie where the main point is to make it a movie that the whole family can watch i understand it well on the business part because a movie that the whole family can watch is a movie that gets more tickets sold they really need to make as much money as possible when they have so expensive and amazing special effects not to speak of the costs of great actors make up and great cameras this is a hard movie to make and how great it is impressive there are many great movie makers behind the movie joss whedon have done an amazing job directing this big movie and zak penn did a great job writing the story for this movie and also did joss whedon whos also the screenplay writer for this movie the movie is an amazing mind blowing breathtaking experience i have never seen any superhero movie as amazing in specialeffects the movie has a great cast with funny lines and you really get afraid if they will die in the fight because you like the characters so much and thanks to the earlier movies you have begun to know them robert downey jr is funny as in the earlier iron man movies and he plays his character confident funny wise and brave mark ruffalo makes the bruce banner character a nice and smart person when hes the hulk he is not nice he is dangerous and wild chris evans plays the captain america character wise brave and nice chris hemsworth plays the thor character confident godlike wise and nice tom hiddleston plays his character evil mad wise and mighty he is theatrical actor who also according to an interview was inspired by shakespeares richard the third when he was creating the loki character with joss whedon the movie is great movie with good acting still i wonder how this movie would be if it wasnt made to also fit for kids movies like the dark knight batman begins and watchmen is great and not very child friendly again the is still great and i really enjoyed it its probably one of the best superhero movies ever made,fantasy
graaaah oh my god the sheer power of this film how it is able to pull of one big magic trick and somehow cram everything in without coming off as a bloated or lazy being that lives off a diet of eyecandy and clichs no absolutely no the takes the harder but more fulfilling route making it more of a god like the mighty thor and god that deserves attention and respect for all mankindi have personally seen this film twice and not once has its quality withed with each viewing it has genuine sense of epicness and suspense that almost makes you think everything will be all right in the end meance provided by loki resonates perfectly in fact in one of his scenes i felt my heart rate going up literally if you only know a bit about the film before seeing it et me tell you he does things that youd didnt expect which only adds to it all the visual splendor is huge and with the acting coupled with it believable the fight sequences can be narrowed down to three things tesserect theft hellicarrier attack and ny final showdown it makes you stay on for the ride it makes wish it could have gone on even my family found themselves in joyful hysterics at the end of it,fantasy
im usually very excited to watch a superhero movie but after hitting a couple of really bad ones i kind of lost my faith for an amazing one i thought of skipping this movie figured it was overkill to have so many heroes in one film but good reviews and the fact that it had joss whedons prints all over it tempted me to go see it anyway and i was not disappointed in fact i was amazedthe threat to earth is genuine and the action spectacular but what really makes this movie stand out for me is the fact that it combines serious action with sharp humor seemingly without effort and it is endearing to see very human flaws in the heroes youve come to love i felt it was a wellpaced movie where every hero got to shine in their own way annnnnd i think coby smulders should definitely feature more in movies like this one honey that outfit wasehm well tailored if you havent seen this one yet run dont walk damnit to the nearest theatre for an amazingly entertaining 25h ride thatll still leave you yearning for more,fantasy
i am not really a fan of movies with too many big characters but this one i have to say is a truly awesome movie its starts off with a bang with loki making a nice appearance and just carries on from there the best part of the film comes in its last 1 hour the actions sequences the graphics and the spot comedy by the actors is superb true credit to the director for making enough screen space for all the characters who have performed brilliantly special mention about iron man robert downey jrand the hulk mark ruffalo outstanding performance by both of them now coming to the storyline its simple loki wants to conquer earth and nick fury samuel l jackson assembles a team the to stop the invasion all the characters have their own special part to play in the film n they carried it out flawlessly as i said before the special feature of this film is its action sequences i was amazed by the way they were pictured really an outstanding job and also the spot comedy especially by iron man and hulk were hilarious in all an excellent movie with lots of action and style one of the best super hero movie of all time go for it,fantasy
well done mr wheddon i hope you go on to make many more like this the storyline was great and the back stories of all the heroes came together well the acting was ok and the actors really brought these characters to life the cgi was seamless and eyewateringly good it was absolutely enthralling for any age group a visual feast for the eyes highly recommend you go and see it as soon as possible i will be going again this weekend my 11 year old son said it was the best film hed ever seen and hes not far off the mark of course it was left open for a sequel and i cannot wait will the new spiderman join them i certainly hope so,fantasy
if you havent watched captain america or thor id recommend you to watch both as youll understand more of the things that will transpire in this movie but even if you dont youll still be able to understand the storyif you enjoy picture perfect cgi and special effects you will not be disappointed as everything is just amazing and looks very real but i wish they would have made the cgi in the flying scenes better as sometimes the objects does not blend in with the backgroundaction scenes is typical of a superhero type movie but the funny moments is what makes this movie so unique funny moments from the beginning all the way towards the end makes this a very enjoyable movie to watch,fantasy
i will start by stating this is the first feature 3d film i have watched and judging by what i have seen it will be the last i was  universal studios florida and got to go on the terminator ride and the 3d was a 100 times better than this and that was 15 years agoin the the 3d was inwards and when things did pop out they seemed to shrink ie the heman flying surfboards thing a ma jigs and the constant people moving round each other to pop in and out 3d was annoyingas for the movie itself some good action parts bit of humour not a very good story boring dialogue not worth the admission fee in my opinion wait for dvd one last thing for people whos seen it plot hole maybe why dint thor go see that bird from his own movie,fantasy
the is exactly what i expected it is action packed it understandably doesnt have much time for character development although we do see more of hawkeye and black widow than in previous marvel installments and the relentless action is accompanied by some fairly good jokes to ease the tension here and there  especially by tony stark and surprisingly the hulk they actually managed to throw in at least two genuinely funny moments around hulks utter brutalitythe lack of character development especially for thor who does seem somewhat out of place in this film but also bruce banner is probably what hurts the the most i didnt actually need any character development since ive seen all previous marvel films at least twice but it nonetheless does stand as a drawback  it feels wrong even though i was expecting it considering the number of characters already established i can hardly imagine anyone who hasnt seen the previous films enjoying the because of thati usually dont care that much for relentless cgi action films but some sequences in the were so blatantly incredible that i had to enjoy them notably a sequence during the huge battle sees the camera pan from one avenger kicking butt to the other  that was really well done and exciting loki was once again a brilliant villain and the perfect choice for the first filmoverall a very good action ride bringing our favorite superheros together the movie doesnt try to be pretentious and goes straight to business  which is what it should do,fantasy
if movies were given great ratings based only on action packed sequences state of the art cgi and humoristic lines then the would surely be one of the best movies ever made however a great movie is instead judged by its coherent story character development good acting and the parallel between the movie and our real world situation these are just to name a few and the clearly lacks all of theseeven though the opening sequence was well done and was promising for the rest of the movie i found myself anxiously sitting in my chair waiting for the end of the film the repetitive action sequences and the predictable turn of events really made this movie a 2  hour snoozefestwhy this movie has a 88 rating as of may 7th is really beyond me this movie deserves at most a 710 but only if you feel generous without getting into to much details the structure plot and setting is very similar to transformers the dark of the moon but instead of having the autobots you have marvel superheroes and instead of having megatron and company you have loki and his crew everyone hated that movie it currently has a 63 rating so why the heck is the so well rated its sad to see that such brainless movies are making a ton of cash and are in the interest of nowaday moviegoers and big movie companies hopefully come end of july christopher nolan will enlighten moviegoers with his soon to be epiclegendary masterpiece the dark knight rises disassemble and let the fire rise,fantasy
i have to say i was skeptical from the start combining superheroes in one movie never works typically they result in cornball clichs bad acting and plot holes you can drive a truck through im pleased that has solid humor acting was only a little uneven and there were but a few what moments eg we have a futuristic ship but no one notices the arrowbomb or bad guys on board since when can the hulk be tamed but like other reviewers have said the bar wasnt raised theres nothing new in this movie i felt mostly detached from all the characters i felt nothing when whatshisface died he had so little screen time there was no emotional connection i think i felt most connected to banner there was at least some character development and a reluctance to do what he was askedlike all super hero movies theres big fights indestructible warriors evil villains and lots of things going boom besides combining all these superheroes in a decent movie nothing really stood out as exceptional my biggest complaint is they all seem indestructible when thor is hurling towards the ground was anyone worried he wouldnt get out or if he did crash that he wouldnt survive no the entire movie is that way there is no true suspense no truly tense moments you know how it will end before the movie startson the contrary batman develops a solid story and while batman is set in a fictitious realm it seems more believable i did like the and look forward to seeing it again but i dont feel it is deserving of such a high ranking on imdb i have higher hopes for the dark night rises and prometheus,fantasy
blockbuster actions scenes and cgi but held back by a video game script accurate to the comic books or not the premise was insufficient for a project with such potential but on the bright side this is what playing video games on playstation 10 will look like most likely and probably with a story line as equal to the one from hopefully better though the movies of the individual heroes were far and away better than the it just wasnt put together well keep making iron mans and incredible hulks preferably with edward norton and scrap thor and captain america their boring and too fictitious in comparison to the others at least iron man and hulk are based in science thor is fantasy magical realm childrens level type stuff and captain america is flat out boring,fantasy
solid movie across the board i enjoyed it immensely while in the theater but looking back two months later it was one of those movies that i could live without having to see again and i scarcely remember any of the fine details which make a movie truly stand out and be an all time greatit was a very good film and they really nailed the hulk this time especially robert downey jr is still an excellent iron man and despite the disappointment of iron man 2 in comparison to the first onewhich is my all time favorite marvel movie it was still very goodi dont believe the fully lived up to its massive hype but still a good entertaining and actionpacked movie that most comic book and superhero fans should enjoy,fantasy
i dragged my heels when it came to assemble did i really want to see yet another comic book adaptation that will be rehashed in ten years for viewers with goldfish memories the amazing spiderman being a case in point apparently i didive never been a great reader of graphic novels though i dipped into the odd batman and flash gordon book while still building camps in hedges but in recent years my forays into pictorial literature have been less frequent and more specific the favoured and most notable examples being joe saccos palestine and a particular high point for me j m dematteis the compleat moonshadowbut i digress assemble concerned me with so many disappointing and occasionally disastrous adaptations out there the league of extraordinary gentlemen both of the hulk adaptations to date what hope was there for a film that threw together a smorgasbord of superheroes all vying for top billing one of which hasnt been tested on the public with a big screen outing of her own with so many egos and so little time it would be a task and a half for the scriptwriter joss whedon to adequately divvy out the linesi neednt have concerned myself with such trivialities whedon who also directs does an admirable job of bouncing the dialogue between characters without swaying too heavily in one direction there isnt a clear star in this grand ensemble piece although that success leads to a new issue in that none are able to engage us with a fully fleshedout story of their own it doesnt matter with the likes of robert downey jnrs iron man who has had two hugely successful outings but is frustrating in the case of scarlet johanssons black widowtheres no need to go into detail on the plot its a superhero flick so naturally something or someone loki thors adopted brother in this instance threatens the existence of mankind and the superheroes fly into action to save the day its formulaic but a lot of fun if not particularly original or inspiring its difficult to surprise cinemagoers nowadays and plots are recycled embellished and reimagined more often than conceived but that neednt be a major issue in a genre film on this scale when the viewer isnt demanding any more than to be entertainedthe cast is superb and in the case of the principals either recognizable as stars in their own right or courtesy of the roles they are reprising here mostly they do as youd expect and deserve neither great plaudits nor condemnation its not that kind of film however beyond the obvious starbilled cast there are some who delight absolutely tom hiddleston wallander the deep blue sea as loki is effortlessly compelling and avoids melodrama in his wickedness that so many villains lean towards while jeremy renner the hurt locker the town is an actor whos been around for a few years and costarred in a number of excellent if not huge films as clint barton he again lends solid support and proves to be a most watchable and compelling actor its just a pity that hes given little opportunity to develop his alter ego hawkeye and one can only hope the inevitable sequel will rectify thatthe unexpected quality comes in the form of the hulk with two major hollywood adaptations to date the kindest comment one can make is that their stars eric bana and edward norton were both put to shame by the dated bill bixby performance in assemble though mark ruffalo truly shines as the tortured reluctant recruit bruce banner the cg big green lump is created more convincingly though still not flawlessly here than in previous attempts but its as banner that ruffalo proves himself for once we have a portrayal of banner that lays his soul bare for us all to see the demons running around inside it and at last im actually looking forward to the solo outing they must surely give ruffalos hulk lets just hope its third time luckyanother film review from the squiss for more reviews from the squiss subscribe to my blog at wwwthesquisscouk,fantasy
to the furthest expectation i didnt give this movie anything above the transformer series thought from the trailers it will be all boom boom etc i did have an idea that there will be a great iron man comedian in the nice armor suit though but i give it all up for joss whedon and his writer friends for creating an extraordinary mix of superhero gang movie the movie frankly did have a slow start but from the point where we see tony stark and thor in shakespeare in the park scene the movie hits of with a non stop action mixed with a very above average hilariousness every super hero even captnick gets a personal intro in the movie each of them better than the other  by the way should mention the hulk of this movie separately even though this was his first notable appearance as a super hero or in an action role and that too with other guys who are extremely or slightly experienced in action movies  mark ruffalo did stand out from most of the them scarlett johansson and robert downey jr were fabulous and incredibly entertaining as usual chris hemsworth proves he is better along with his buddies than alone like in his own thor movie tom hiddleston steels every scene he is in and makes his mark as a great actor jeremy renner  as of for him i really feel like they did make him wait in line to the last with the least important role if there is any in the six of the you can really pull that out from the movie but his hawkeye is a brilliant display equally to othersoverall the movie is a great success in my eyes and its worth the while to wait for a sequel apart from all hulk is funny in this movie something you dont see everyday a scene particularly i dont want to say which includes tom hiddleston and mark ruffalo on the start tower alone deserves all the credits the movie does,fantasy
perhaps one of the most fun elements of the imdb is seeing newly released films achieve high entries on the top 250 chart before wider recognition gradually sees them slip down at date of writing assemble is just outside the top 30 of alltime greatest movies yet still sits comfortably above supposedly inferior efforts like rashomon taxi driver m modern times and citizen kane i can only assume that it will eventually slip into a more realistic level though its been four years since the release of the dark knight and thats still in the top ten thats not to say that this movie or nolans batman sequel arent good films but they probably arent great films and the lightweight and ultimately draining picture isnt really able to sit there with the classic artistic works of cinemas entire historythis is not to be snobbish about the imdbs top 250 well much although populist and seemingly never tiring of freemanroberts again a good film and worthy of top forty perhaps but all time no1 it does generally have a rewarding regard of the classics rashomons struggle to break the top 50 even on a good day remains puzzling but no more so than this somewhat hollow popcornfest being so fetedit doesnt help that after so much build up  including five movies leading into this one  it cant possibly pay off all the pre expectations and then theres joss whedons twojoke schtick all predictable instant reverses including the title quote and largely uninspired deconstruction nowadays every film is so relentlessly post modern that it doesnt come as a surprise but then every film these days is also 3d so that doesnt come as much of a surprise eitherultimately its an okay movie the jokes entertain the masses johansson looks stunning and even though downey jrs schtick in the tony stark role already looks tired just three movies in mark ruffalo does well as the new bruce banner chris evans used to stealing weak superhero movies with the fantastic four here finds most of his character pieces on the cutting room floor though chris hemsworth manages to salvage something as thor as the most commercially successful superhero movie of all time its chances of repeating that sentence with the word superhero removed also look pretty high but an all time classic of the medium no not quite,fantasy
its not a bad movie in true i enjoyed it but it could be little bit shorter and not so pathetic more than two hours it was too long for me and also my friends and in the middle of the movie there was too little action like on action movie killing agent phil and his good bye speech was so cheap so predictable its one big fake and not so smart agent hill also wasnt fun at all ok mr downey was perfect and hulks beating sit out of loki was just marvelous but i hoped more from this movie not another we are so patriotic and boring superheroes movie oh and making it 3d what for cause every movie from avatar must be 3d now even when there really not so many 3d scenes as i said its not bad but i think its only for marvels fans,fantasy
by now its probably all been said before so im really just adding weight to the views on both sides of the nerdgasm that was theentertainment is the name of the game here and whedon doesnt hold back for a minute throwing brawling superheroes invading aliens and widescale destruction at the screen throughout its running timesome of the character interplay particularly between tony stark iron man and bruce banner hulk are a joy to watch with the formers acerbic putdowns thor is dubbed point break and captain america is renamed rock of ages injecting fun into what could have otherwise been a joyless jaunt between explosionsthe acting is credible overall with mark ruffalo perfectly characterising bruce banner as the embodiment of all that the hulk is not awkward reserved quiet robert downey jnr channelling starks usual suave arrogance and tom hiddlesons loki permeating charm and menace in equal measure banner comments you can smell crazy on him at one pointthese are all positives id been expecting from the man who wowed me with firefly and serenity and my wife with buffyunfortunately there are quite a few problems as well even for a comic book fan such as myselffirstly theres some seriously lumpen exposition particularly the juvenile intro scene where the alien plan to invade is bulletpointed for the audience in case we cant follow the basic premise i fully expected a white board and felt markers to be used at any second the endcredit scene is in a similar vein and is equally cringeworthya pethate of mine and my wifes is a lack of logic and the excels in this area with 1 the base explosion near the intro completely unexplained just to be accepted 2 loki brainwashingcontrolling his minions by tapping their hearts rather than their heads where their minds are doh with his staff and 3 why there are numerous scenes in which the invading aliens dont open fire at the clearly exposed cops civilians and heroes they are flying over are they saving ammoanother point to consider is the absence of the national guard were they off on holiday that day by some margin though the greatest gripe i have with the is the lack of genuine threat that loki and his army poses to not just the themselves but to any modern armywhile loki is more than capable of taking care of captain america then again who isnt he is quite clearly no match for hulk thor or iron man who each take turns in highlighting this fact in my experience of superheroes its paramount to play the heroes as the underdogs who must face and overcome a challenge that at first seems beyond them this is what makes for exciting and unpredictable entertainmentin the theres no point at which were under any illusion that loki and his horde will fail nor is there any need for concern over our heroes since they are the overwhelming favourites to rise triumphantall that said i didnt feel shortchanged when i left the cinema and this is coming from someone who generally avoids hollowood movies maybe some of the more abrasive critics of the movie are right  some of us are just nerdy and want to see characters with incredible powers knock the crap out of each otheralthough i can understand where a rating of 88 has come from overenthusiastic fanboys fresh from the cinema typing up their reviews before changing their trousers i cant add to it the isnt pans labyrinth or amelie and in this context it cant reach top spot or anywhere near it if youre giving a movie with this numerous faults a full score youre clearly in need of watching some genuinely wellcrafted moviesits not clever but it is big,fantasy

the movie gets high marks for not being hokey in fact great effort was put in the movie to make it a movie it gets a well done from me you have to suspend any logic or common sense to be entertained if you can this movie will keep you occupied for over 2 hours dont be tempted to make sense out of the story because it leads to questions that invite logic and common sense the comics can get away with so much because in that world it comes across as that is what happens in that world trying to transfer comics to the screen becomes challenging because trying to bring a super hero to reality is not easy so we settle for the next best thing which is to make it entertaining the director pulls that off quite well in the end you want to ask your self if you got your monies or tickets worth the answer is yes this is not a movie that invites you to come back and see it again there are no memorable scenes which is its only flaw all things considered go see it in the theater and then wait until it comes out on cable pass on the dvd purchase good popcorn movie candy tasty drink and snack,fantasy
and so the most awaited movie of the year the is released and i went with the whole family to see it  not sure why anyone would come here and read some reviews about it i mean let us face it you already made your decisions to go and see it you just want to make sure  a hugely marketed movie like this will always attract people to go and see it it is very hard to ignore all the big fuss and all those giant billboards and adds of it everywhere  i went in with huge expectations and it had to be said that the movie did not let me downhowever i believe it is way too overrated and over hyped  the movie starts out very slowly and for the first hour or so i felt some boredom creeping in or was it my exuberant mood and impatience for the action to starts  there was just too much stretch of boring speech and slow scenes of the gathering of the in the first hour or soi was expecting a roller coaster of action  adventure scenes from start to finish and i guess i was slammed in the face by the slow built up in the beginning my two younger daughters  5 and 6  certainly got bored and fidgety which added to my frustrationhaving said that the movie is a success in what its trying to do which is gathering all those super heroes together in one film it was entertaining and enjoyable over the whole run i just thought that the plot was nothing special just your average cartoonish plot of an evil villain who wants to rule the world the serious dialog involving the main plot was boring and empty with no interest in it however when the funny scenes and dialog jump in its really enjoyable and pure funeach of the characters had an almost equal screen time although the roles seems uneven with the highest importance going to iron man and a lot of time went into trying to explore the black widow and hawkeye relationship but failing in adding any strong background about those two characters did not feel or care much about themthe hulk was also sort of put on the side not clear what his involvement was into the team supposedly he knows much about the gama radiation but i was puzzled with him at times he was completely out of control and not distinguishing between the heroes and villains and other times he was completely submissive to his fellow super heroesit was clear that iron man was running the show maybe the leader some how which i liked since he is among my favorites his quarrels with captain america were fun and there seemed liked a power struggle between the two thor was another character put on the side did not have a big impact other than his brother being the villain  sameul l jacksons character nick fury was the most annoying as the leader of the his speeches and his overall role were useless and annoying very frustrating and if i were a super hero i wouldnt join a team that he leads just an empty charactercertain parts of the plot were lame and silly like when a certain character in the movie was killed and his death was the ultimate reason for the to finally join together was a bit too cornynow the good parts  because once the action starts it really is brilliant  some very impressive visuals and solid action scenes with the involvement of the especially the final fight in the end it was superb although not entirely original  some similarities to the last transformers movie  still very enjoyable and the kids certainly were impressed and glued to the big screen with excitementso in summary the is not the best movie ever made and not in anyway a masterpiece however it is entertaining and is original as the first film with multiple superheroes in it the first half gets a 65 out of 10 but then the 2nd half of the movie gets a solid 9  my 8 year old son says its a 10  moebardiblogspotcom,fantasy
the is not as good as the dark knight im just going to say that from the off the storyline is escapism and it has some genuinely funny moments in it but it doesnt have the deep characters or visual spectacle joss whedons script keeps the film going and lets be honest this film could have been a train wreck what makes the tick is the relationships that each of the characters have with one another this is where the film really takes flight when all the characters are in a pressure cooker together it gives the film weight and suspense especially with mark ruffalos hulk joss whedon should be given a lot of credit for crafting such a cohesive and well thought out scriptthe dialogue is what keeps it above board visuals have never been joss whedons strong suit but i did notice a wink to his first feature film serenity in zoom shots in the action sequences see serenitys finale as the ship falls from the sky the film doesnt look bad by any means it just has the same sheen that the other marvel films seem to support but it didnt really have a choice following suit from its predecessors but lack of visual flair is sometimes what makes me dislike these movies they look too clean and have a sheen that makes it look too much like a cartoon for my personal taste other superhero film dont seem to have this sheen making them more visually pleasing to me  the nolan and burton batmans spring to mind as well as the marvel xmen filmsthe film works equally as well in 2d as it does in 3d the third dimension is not needed here the visual storytelling though nothing groundbreaking stands on its own two feet making the 3d gimmick unnecessary its very difficult to score this film as it is by and large a fantastic superhero film thats enjoyable from beginning to end but enjoyment isnt all i mark it on was the story original well no not at all it was an accumulation of its heroes solo films were the visuals good yes but they werent anything you havent seen in other similar films the is fun and josss ingenious and humorous dialogue will make you come back for another sitting but by and large this isnt a anything more than a summer popcorn film not that it tries to be more either but what do i know i gave salt a 9,fantasy
first part of the movie is boring with not much action only 5of the second half if i may say  movie picks up only after bruce banner turns to green monster it only happens just before the intervalthere is not much meat in the story somethings i find totally strangeiron vs thor fight is totally without any much reasonwhy loki wants to destroy earththe real deal in the movie is hulk  his presence is totally awesomehulk vs thor fight is good  the biggest scene in the movie i find is when hulk with only one punch destroys the gigantic eelworm thinghe stands tall among all the heroes  i wonder why hulk solo movies are not that big hit as other heroesso one should see this movie at least once ,fantasy
definitely a good movie but not great i kind of expected more of it but still great fun for the whole family action packed lots of laughter and truly good jokes good characters but no plot ive read lots of reviews talking about being great but to me a great movies demands a great plot and thats missing also a few things could have been better executed like the fight between thor and iron man and how hulk enters the final battle three mains drawbacks that took some credibility away 1 iron man can almost kick thors ass on a fight but is trashed by an airship engine so the engine can cause more damage tham thors hammer 2 shield super mega hiper battleship gets boarded and almost destroyed by a couple of terrorists on a helicopter if they cant handle 10 guys from earth how do they expect the viewer to believe they are earths last defense against aliens 3 thor falls from the sky on a glass cube and is afraid to die after all we have seen him doing  anyway still recommend because its great entertainment,fantasy
i had the highest of expectations for this film and it over delivered i would advise you watch in imax 3d it was just incredible  the effects  the story line  the humour the whole cinema was crying with laughter at some parts the hulk is scripted better than ever  finally he has been done properly banner delivers in every way as normal and he does have a soft spot i watched this last night and am going to go watch it again today as an add on for anyone who cant be bothered to travel to see a film like this in imax  you really need to make the effort  you wont visit a normal cinema again make sure you stay past the final credits  dont miss that superb,fantasy
storytelling as an art whats that and who cares anyway when hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies then wheres the financial incentive to make decent films 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades  and i have been going to the movies for over 40 years so thats saying something  for really bad blockbusters first hunger games next dark shadows and now thei am so sick and tired of new york city specifically the island of manhattan being attacked in the movies hello it was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3000 real people including my brothers coworker coworkers wife and unborn child but what is really despicable is that at the very end of the the you briefly get to see a reallife news photo from 911 mourning the dead thats just plain disgusting exploitation but lets not stop there at the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local new york state senator rant about how our avenger heroes wrecked manhattan that our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1000 ways are to blame for all the destruction fine i agree many politicians are real jerks but to put the letter d for democrat next to this senators name speaks volumes about the films real message democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful winy creeps thats real cute i thought hollywood was sooooooo liberal if you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a r for republicans after the senators name after all the republicans in congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a federally funded medical fund for first responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic debris that was released into the air the is also plain boring with the most twodimensional characters in the history of film making sure i wanted the good guys to win sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty but really now who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching frosty the snowman for the tenth time the last third of the is nothing more than war porn i will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from the as long as i live even for free or if hollywood offers me a million dollars overall hollywood has done a decent job with the xmen and the fanatic four but for some reason the rightwing kooks who control the avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine no wonder why stan lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film its just too bad he and the rest of hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck for those of you who have never taken a film class in college before a good film has an interesting story and actors that interact well with each other it really is not too hard to imagine you could even write it on the back of a matchbook cover,fantasy
i spent the worst twelve bucks of my entire life buying the ticket to watch this movie i had to get out of the theater because i couldnt handle such amount of trash sorry for the marvel lovers but this movie sucks from beginning to end i bought the ticket taking as reference the 87 average the imdb meter published completely disappointing from now on ill take more care when trusting that meter or actually is not imdb problem but its the perfect example of how humans can be dumb enough to love such an insult to the story telling job or is a movie made just for the marvel geeks but really i think its just business for those who seek profound stories this is not the one at all youll regret for sure if you watch the movie a considerable huge amount of the film is war explosions soundeffects in not a complete enemy of cinema effects when they are used for good like avatar but this time is empty from bottom to top i guess its just the way of making business and earn a lot of money its ironic after watching the movie part of it i started to believe that humans were made to be ruled and submitted even when we deny it and loving this movie is the example,fantasy
with only two days in theaters this is already regarded as the best superhero blockbuster ever made  yet it takes a while to resemble any such thing after a long brooding buildup where each individual tony starks iron man thor captain america and bruce banner bicker like students in detention class we realize why no ones getting alongour derisive cerebral antagonist villain loki the skinny conceited brother of thor wants to rule the world  and is counting on the to fight amongst themselves after which formidable aliens will wreak havoc on new york city when this happens an epic showdown the entire third act has terrific moments most having to do with banners alter ego the hulk who throughout the film provides the most suspense  each character and the audience anticipates his inevitable transformationforget about the plot device a box emulating power that will in the hands of loki cause bad things to happen because after the aliens liken to a gang of hoppedup predator clones fly into the city with giant slug creatures nothing else matters its all about destroying impenetrable foes with tons of strength and of course teamwork which comes a little too late to make this a worthy superhero collectiveother than a neat fight between iron man and thor in a forest thors the last to get the memo that all must work together its all about that finale and as for being one of the best superhero movies ever with the time and energy of the characters not getting along and overexplaining the reasons why in years to come even the biggest fans might have their thumbs pressed on the fastforward buttonyet the stuff that pays off does so in silver dollars but with all the hype and potential this reviewer expected goldfor more reviews wwwcultfilmfreakscom,fantasy

no i dont think the is entirely horrible in fact its a perfectly decent escapist type movie but dont expect to walk away from the theatre with a new found love for life or a fresh perspective that any real movie will deliver the is the current watercooler movie for good reason its easy to talk about the cgi the action the comedy its easy and might as well have a laugh track its so instructive from start to finish the plot carries the same formula  inyourfaceaction comic relief inyourfaceaction comic relief repeat until done the jokes were painfully predictive and obvious i felt like cattle being herded along the movie all too aware of the cheap tricks used to get the audience laughing at a budget of over 200 million it felt cheap and without substancei also think its insulting this movie carries such a high imdb rating i suppose most dont realize theyre cattle,fantasy
when the tesseract suddenly activates itself it briefly opens a portal a small one but nonetheless it allows lokiwho uses his illusions well to pass through and he now has a sceptre that allows him to take over people by touch he escapes with the aforementioned seemingly limitless source of energy and with the threat of it being used to allow an invasion of earth by the alien force the chitari what can fury do other than assemble this is an excellent piece that lives up to the hype it will satisfy comic readers and more casual viewers of this franchise alike a lot of people will be exclaiming that so i will try to back it up instead of just fawning over thisand believe me i could go 1000 words just doing that it follows up on all no all of the threads set up in the five films that came beforeand yes it will really help to have watched all of them before this then again if you have any interest in this you probably already have nothing is abandoned or ignored the sheer planning that went into this and this is still full of fantastic surprises and for all the developmentall of that in this is highly credible by the way of characters powers and conflictsand this takes the ball and runs with it and adds the interpersonal relationships of these people who have not shared a screen before now who are rather different people that precedes this there is a solid amount of it in this as well all sixand no you cant tell that two of them one of them especially havent gotten much screen time before this members of the faction are treated to an astonishing introductionactually that goes for nick and the shield helicarrier both very cool as well a strong heroic act that only they could have accomplished and a situation of immense perilnot to mention that theyand we are treated to one continuous tracking shot that showcases all of them taking names using their talent one by one once theyve grown into a team working together no they dont start out like that and yes there is indeed infighting early on and yes we get every oneonone that anyone wants and it is glorious the trailer is literally just the preview all of them have something to doand they are recruited gradually no one overshadowing anyone else and somehow this gets all the aspects that make them work individually in their own movies somehow without getting tonal schizophrenia some reason to be in this and the threathiddleston is friggin intimidating is grand enough that we need all of them and for them to band together tony has to prove that he is selfless that he doesnt just fix his own mistakesand he brings his mainstay of taking what can barely even be called calculated risks that come out to putting a severe dent in the enemies steve has to adjust to a world and time completely foreign to him and bring them all into one effective unitand he is the great leader that is required one that you yourself would follow and indeed a super soldiera title he earns thorwho brings godlike might and a shakespearian sibling rivalry with the bad guy and natashawho is the real brains of the operation and can manipulate the foe they use one of her qualities well that being her apparently complete detachment from emotion leading to an uncertainty of what she does feel and what not are dealing with a lot of guilt on account of it being an asgardian causing trouble for the planet and her dark past as a spy whod take on missions for or against anyone respectively clintwho brings his specialized arrows and extreme accuracy to good use has his own to make amends foryoull see brucewho comes with the sheer destructive weight of his alter ego is brought on for his expertise on the subject of gamma radiationhe can help find the vital cube and i dont need to spell out what he feels bad about do i he does seem to have gotten the hulk under control or has he this builds up the transformation and he remains a danger hes the only one to have another person attached to it than played it last and while i had no problem with nortonwho i love in other stuff in that he didnt do all he could with it though this part is ruffalos there is this very terrifying aspect to him he could metamorphose and cause significant damage and pain and he plays it like youd expect him to be very nonconfrontational and anxious yet smart and confident in his field all of them risk their lives and limb for the good of mankind saving countless people there are not many supporting rolesphil coulson does return and he is enjoyable with a fandom of cap theres also a female agent named hill who kicks ass in fact every woman in this is hot independent and not objectified kudos for that along with the rest whedon with focus placed where it should be on the ensemble cast is it necessary for me to devote space to let you know that the acting is spoton youve already seen chris robert and liam do incredible and they do so here too everyone does the writing is phenomenal i am struggling to find one line of dialogwith iron manlike wit and banter that isnt quotable sharp and welldelivered the action is plentiful has distinct stages to itnone of that unaimed mindless crap culminating in a truly massive climax and somehow never running out of steam or exhausting the audience this keeps to a pitch perfect pace and at nearly two and a half hours there is nothing tedious or rushed the fx breathtaking 3d used rightonly little distinctly moves towardspoints at you i recommend this to everyone who is considering it 1010,fantasy
i went into this movie with some very high expectations i dont feel this was unjustified and i came out pretty disappointed the special effects were not enough to justify some screaming plot holes that i was inches away from screaming out in the middle of the movie theatre not to mention the at times stolid performances from some of the cast lets get something clear just because two characters argue does not mean an extra dimension was added to them robert downey junior does a good job but there is little else here in terms of acting apart from this the movie just follows a painfully formulaic story line team of superheroes get together to fight a grand evil and must put their differences aside for the greater good which they eventually do and of course captain america struts onto the scene and begins shouting orders somehow he rips this authority from thin air amongst a god an egotistic super genius millionaire and the bloody hulk overall cheesy completely devoid of any novelties and shamelessly formulaic the 3 stars are for the slight entertainment i got from the film at times,fantasy
i watched this movie after reading the reviews it seems many of the reviewers give it too muchi like the fight and the jokes are goods but the story is not what i have expected as a great moviewhere are the army and jetfighters when aliens attack after only fighting for less than an hour and they suddenly launch a nuclear missile how come the were very easy to gather each other in the battlefield in a large city alrite ironman can flyand they should add independence day fighting to create a great massive fight against the alienand all of the aliens are dead after the host were blown up that was too easythe dark knight were ten times better than thisbut i give this 7 out of 10 for the jokes and the acting,fantasy
like i thought sothe characters simply cant be in one movie it degrades each character because each one has its own environment iron man in the technological worldcaptain americas character i still cant understandhe is only got that freaking shield that is unique about him i mean seriously what kinda superhero is he thor and his gods which belong somewhere in lord of the ring or something hulk who exists due to some chemical reactions and interactions or gamma rays each character has a different theme and environment bringing them together isnt right the acting of most of the actors was normal actually at times it felt they were in a play not a movie the story is abit silly or i should say typical it felt like this was a walt disney movie and ironically enough it turned out to be a walt disney movie but on the other hand the special effects were amazing and there were some funny scenes anyway out of 10 i would give it 6 but welli have my own taste i wouldnt probably go for the 2nd sequel of it i would most likely recommend this to 20 year olds and below,fantasy
i came into watching this movie blindly i didnt know much about the at the time all i knew was that a bunch of superheroes were going to work together for the first time ever but to tell you the truth throughout this whole movie my heart was racing and the hairs on my spine and arms were standing up i could feel the rush of excitement every time tony stark suits up and when steve rodgers grabs his shield the humor made the whole theater laugh which made me lighten up and to tell you the truth this movie made me obsessed with superheroes and i would never believe in a million years i would be this into people turning green and tearing everything up but that is what makes me want to see more of joss whedons masterpieces,fantasy
back in mid00s when marvel announced their intentions for the marvel cinematic universe we quite honestly didnt believe they could pull it off five big budget blockbuster movies before a grande finale before that we had had trouble getting even two sequels and even then they normally hadnt been all that great with especially the third movie usually sucking something fiercebut they did it somehow they went and did it and yeah you could argue that they had the advantage of being allowed to switch characters and subjects around freely and that the only actual sequel iron man 2 was easily the weakest of the bunch but still this was a revolutionary movie something we had never seen before a phenomenon that changed film makingfurthermore its not only a great idea its also one of the best superhero films ever made one of the best action popcorn films as well and one of my personal favourites and its actually easy to see why youve already established all of your characters youve built them up and given them clear identities you also have an amazing ensemble cast of actors most of them having risen to the highest echelons of hollywood you have joss god of nerds whedon directing and writing youve already created a need and want for this kind of movie so you dont have to water it down it can be an honest and direct superhero film with quick wit blazing action and phenomenal state of the art special effects no need to sell it to the big audiences by cramming it needlessly full of everything else you can keep it pureand it works so well its a fastpaced movie with every scene full of excitement jokes and entertainment but whedon knows what hes doing theres pacing there are lulls in between the action allowing you to reacquaintance yourself with these characters and their individual story lines all of which meet and intertwine in this colossus of a moviethe is pure entertainment its only smart in a quickwitted street punk manner so its certainly not going to win over the worst of the high brow community but what it has in spades is charm entertainment value and pure hightuned perfected action amazing movie,fantasy
joss whedons or assemble is the 1st avenger movie and it was a very important one because it was marvels big ticket outing and making such comic book movies is easier said than done because not only are there millions of comic book fans to please who express displeasure at the slightest deviation of storyline but you have to work with a humongous budget and manage an ensemble cast more so in case of this one downey jr johansson evans ruffalo hemsworth and huddlestonbut whedon manages it quite well not only does he please his comic book fans but usual movie going audience too the witty one liners the one on one fights  watch out for the iron man thor fight  keeps the film flowing and never bores performance wise everyones quite good downey jr once again brings the house down with his tony stark evans is good as captain america mark ruffalo is the new hulk and he has passed his test with flying colors huddlestone is delicious as lokithe climactic 30 min fight is alone worth a ticket if u love superheroes u are absolutely gonna love this fun larger than life extravaganza,fantasy
in five years we saw the coming of iron man a talented engineer who built a powerful exosuit the hulk a scientist whose rage can cause him to explode into a beast of furious strength thor a godlike extraterrestrial who can summon storms captain america a supersoldier from the past combined with the tough and skilled agents of shield all these heroes would join forces to defend earth against threats that couldnt otherwise be facedfrom the start marvels jumps right into the universe it set up in all previous films and it wastes no time in jumping into the action lokis arrival immediately brings peril and destruction causing the heroes to assemble and clash in big explosive brawls it all builds up to a massive halfhour climax where everybody contributes to the fight the action is often jawdropping as heroes fly all over the city and wrestle with huge waves of extraterrestrials the heroics are as epic as they come but even when theres no fighting the movie remains effortlessly entertaining thanks to its endearing combination of thrills humor and personalitythe story could be described as the same thing seven samurai was the simple tale of heroes defending a place in this film the heroes are a mismatched family where some characters connect and others butt heads the volatile concoction of personalities is what makes the team so special each character is given a chance to shine and together they form a uniquely dysfunctional dynamic that makes their dialogue sharp their drama tense and their teamwork compelling it even goes so far as pumping newfound color and life into characters that existed in previous films but never had a chance to shine until now particularly loki whose devilish mischief steals the show often black widow hawkeye and agent coulson stand out much better in this film as wellthe film looks spectacular with quality photography and editing there are a lot of unusual camera angles in this movie and i think it looks awesome other shots are crafted in very dynamic ways that not only show off the action but the characters in evoking ways acting is a joy to watch from the whole cast robert downey jr is as enjoyable as ever as tony stark while chris hemsworth and chris evans provide decently commanding performances mark ruffalo is probably the most pleasant surprise from the cast who provides a balanced and compelling portrayal of bruce banner scarlett johansson jeremy renner and samuel l jackson and clark gregg are all fun to watch and tom hiddleston nails it as a bad guy we love to hate writing is quite sharp and precise for great effect this production uses greatlooking sets props costumes locales and special effects alan silvestris music score is appropriately heroic and catchy comes close to being the endallbeall superhero film one epic experience that brings together multiple heroes for one grand fight in a manner that feels so naturally entertaining and harmonic55 entertainment perfect  content very good  film perfect,fantasy
probably the most solidly structured movie ive ever seen what i admire about the is that it doesnt go in guns blazing from the start it doesnt open with the themselves but with nick fury and maria hill who are there right at the beginning of what is eventually one of the best superhero movies ever charged with explosive action mind blowing spectacle and big laughs when the world is threatened by loki and his army of alien chitauri the initiative is activated and a team of the most remarkable beings come together to save the world from obliteration iron man thor captain america hulk black widow and hawkeye team up in one of the best movie finales to hit our screens new york is a playground for jaw dropping action stunning camera shots and immersive 3d joss whedons ability to balance out this enormous cast is unlike any other and with whip smart writing and a powerhouse story this is the ultimate marvel adventure would i watch this again a dozen times and more this is a perfect choice for a movie night a family night in and the cast are better than ever playing these superheroes weve come to love over the past few years and watching hawkeye dive off an exploding rooftop backwards firing his arrow brings me the nerdiest of nerd tears,fantasy
we can all rest easy they pulled it off marvels the or assemble as its known in the uk and other markets is everything weve been hoping for an exciting superhero teamup film packed with memorable momentsive been waiting for this movie since i first read an comic book when i was 8years old and of course that sort of feeling is shared by so many people across multiple generations given the 49yearold history thats a huge burden to put on the shoulders of writerdirector but if anyone could make it work it would be the director whose geek creed and gift for strong characterization has been long established via the likes of buffy the vampire slayer and firefly and his time writing for marvel comics astonishing xmeneric goldman from ign,fantasy
the  an ensnarement of action by evan wingenbach joss whedons the has received loads of appraisal for its glorious battles and epic action its a movie thats easy to market and easy to make money but nothing really special filled with mindless battle sequences that certainly gives the awe experience but nothing more a classic case of a big budget meant to have big hype and big profitthe conflict in the story is quickly established in the opening scene when the tesseract a cube of pure power unleashes a portal and out comes loki the banished demigod halfbrother of thor loki steals the tesseract planning to use its power to open a portal unleashing an alien army on earth this gives the movie the breathtakingly simple plot stop loki or the world will end the rest of the movie involves 5 super heroes captain america iron man the hulk thor and black widow plus another that spends most of the movie brainwashed on lokis side hawkeye these super heroes come together throughout the movie slinging backhanded remarks at each other making them joss whedons ultimate dysfunctional family especially between captain america and tony stark there is strong tension but of course in the end the all put their differences aside and use their different but still the same skills together to save humanity what a predictable story book finishthe biggest problem is that the movie really has no suspense never throughout the movie is there a doubt in your mind that the will succeed they are given a basic but serious conflict and they just blow right through it with little to no complications a giant alien snake comes out of the portal to wreak havoc no problem the hulk will kill it with a single punch the government is going to nuke the populated city to try and cut their losses to only new york hey dont worry iron man will just fly the nuke into the portal and use it on the aliens but instead of just throwing the missile in the portal ill fly all the way in with it that way its a bit more dramatic insert eye roll herethe whole movie leading up to the end they are building up that loki is more powerful than he seems and that its going to take a miracle to defeat him this attempt at suspense would maybe work if it wasnt just one big lie this would be suspense dies in seconds during one of the most anticlimactic villain fights of all time rivaling the death of smaug in the hobbit the hulk approaches loki and you start to feel hey this is it the big loki fight then in a blink of an eye this thought is killed while the hulk flings loki around like an overcooked noodle completely demolishing him and leaving him unable to move and for all intends and purposes defeated apparently it was that easy overall the movie has no real plot its a simple plot that a 10 year old couldve written there is no real suspense just consistently reassured fact that the kickass the creators of this film basically just made up for what they lacked in actual movie plot with breathtaking action to keep you excited and entertained and to make you not realize that there really isnt much there if you want to sit back not put much thought in and just enjoy some crazy action and some try hard comedy this is the movie for you final verdict 6 out of 10 stars,fantasy
the assemble is almost perfect entertainmentplot in a paragraph some of earths mightiest heroes must come together and learn to fight as a team if they are to stop the mischievous loki brother of thor and his alien army from enslaving humanitywhilst there is a real lack of tension as you know none of the main heroes will actually die its still an entertaining movie that hits almost all of the spotsof the cast chris evans is solid as captain america chris hemsworth does a great job as thor stepping into ed nortons shoes mark ruffalo is a brilliant addition to the cast as bruce banner scarlett johansson looks great and holds her own against the big boys too tom hiddleston is a lot of fun as loki and clark gregg is worthy of note as agent coulson samuel l jackson brings what samuel l jackson brings as nick fury and jeremy renner is fine as hawkeye but it is robert downey jr who steals the show as tony starkiron mani look forward to the second movie,fantasy
when i watched marvels the i had became a fan of it i was surprised to see all the heroes together at a big screen when i watched the trailer i was blown up by iti had too much expectations from it and i have to say that this movie had full filled my expectations this movie had made me a fan of superhero genrebefore the i was not a fan of scifi superhero genre but when i watched the concepts of this movie i had really liked itand after the i had watched all the superhero movies of marvel and dc comics really liked this movie wish to watch a sequel if it comes out i will definitely watch it,fantasy
not just a great superhero film not just a great superheroes film but also somehow a great joss whedon film funny goes with dark and dramatic modern arm in arm with classic storytelling methods and tropes comprehensible special effects and great use of visual space although aspect ratio is a compromise largely due to 3d and staying true to actors heights also w hulks so its not cinematographically outstanding theres definitely been a discussion about this by the creative and camera departments but overall it still felt satisfying to watch and they pull of the comic book magicscifi realism wellbut the most astonishing thing youll feel watching this film is that it works somehow all the ingredients work even if they dont seem to at first which is the story of youre more than the sum of the parts and working together rather than conflict is the only way and it does very well,fantasy
having enjoyed thor and also the iron man films i felt this combination should be mind blowing i wasnt disappointedfirst of all if you havent seen thor then dont watch this film you wont follow the set up its this which holds the film together and explains much the film starts with shields discovery of something called the tesseract the tesseract contains some kind of intense energy and shield employs dr eric selvig to try and understand its energy hot on the heels of selvigs investigations is loki of asgard a super villain and brother of thor with breathtaking ambition loki comes in uses the tesseract to enslave both selvig and hawkeye and gets both on his side cue nick fury who has to get together the other members of the group these include natasha romanov dr bruce banner captain america steve rogers and iron man tony stark it also includes thor who comes along in hot pursuit of loki to try and bring him back to asgard and face justicecue lots of thrilling set pieces there is starks extraordinary tower based on his clean energy ideas thor and lokis humorous verbal sparring parodied by tony stark and tony stark and steve rogers verbal sparring all play nicely off against each other there is natashas moment with loki the team coming together on board shields ship and finally the incredible attack by the chitari on new york led by loki as is usual with these dazzling things much of the plot flies out of the window amidst the extraordinary visuals tom hiddlestons loki has a nicely subtle play out and seems to be more than comfortable in his role chris hemsworth wears his thor well robert downey jnr is as wonderfully wisecracking as ever chris evans gives his elder statesman captain america a well rounded character as totally different from his jackthelad role as one of the fantastic four scartlett johansson plays romanov with coolness and mark ruffalo adds a sharper performance to bruce banner than ive seen in a long time jeremy renner is a bit too quiet for hawkeye combined that with nick fury and the other members of shield and you have experience which rises out of what could be a very overwhelming movie experience,fantasy
im really more of a dc guy and watched this movie well out of synch with other related marvel films and tv series ive watched previously but even as some of the finer points of the narrative went over my head somewhat nevertheless this epic teamup of four plus two major superheroes was an absolute blast the two and a half hour viewing time absolutely flew by making this one of the best blockbusters ive seen from the comic universe the longer playing time allows plenty of room for character development as well as initial faceoffs between iron man and captain america and later hulk and thor to whet the appetite for the allaction sfx fest finale when the heroes plus black widow and hawkeye finally get their act together to repel the chitauri alien invasion plotted by loki all the main characters get more or less equal onscreen exposure apart possibly from hulk but his delayed appearance is of course in line with the surprise element his transformation engenders and is very much worth the wait in any case theres room for humour too unsurprisingly in the main from cynical tony stark  iron man and some sight gags too like the hulks slightly overdone fistpump with thor and also his later takedown of loki after a suitably grandiose speech by the latter as the most successful individual performer in the franchise its not a huge shock to see iron man save the day this time but fans of the individual heroes will all be satisfied with how their favourites are treated im sure besides the heroes tom hiddlestone makes for a convincingly asinine loki samuel j jackson gets to jut and chomp a lot as nick fury and the likable clark greig impresses as furys straightarrow righthand man coulson the effects are literally outofthisworld as new york is laidwaste by the invading chitauri and their massive caterpillartype spaceship and individual silver surfertype jetski flying machines sure you have to suspend a lot of disbelief as the super six take on and defeat an army of it would appear thousands but it is the comics after allit seems to me marvel is well ahead of dc in the movie stakes certainly if this allaction megahit is anything to go by i look forward to its inevitable followup,fantasy
first saw this movie around 4 month ago and i loved it immediately i think this was my very first superhero movie i saw and i gotta say i liked it this is a movie with a plot and actors which is something that has never be done i think at least i never saw anything like that the actors are really good in my opinion my initial concerns were about how the movie would live up to this enormous hype it had built up surprisingly enough it exceeded my expectations in a good way the story and dialog was created with full blown hollywood style treatment but enjoyable and sometimes very funny the character development was also strong something that most directors cannot handle due to the fact that making 7 superheroes individually stand out is pretty difficult but hey joss whedon did it so i give huge credit and respect for it anyways long words short in my opinion this was a good movie that lived up to its hype,fantasy
shield recruits a team of super heroes in order to take down loki before he brings his army to earth to conquer it first of all although there are many many wrongs with the film the beginning is good there is enough humor action interest and so on however after shield gets loki the interest disappears into thin air and the only thing that its left is the continuous action scenes and there are in fact too much action scenes at the moment you think that there are mover more enemies appear and the have to fight them all by themselves the plot is getting quite confusing too as things have to get in progress in order for the final battle to happen so 5 out of 10 because it seemed that the film would be a nice action movie with many of the well known heroes coming together but the final result is very disappointing,fantasy
its amazing what eye candy can do these days if i could sum up this movie it would be its the embodiment of all that shouldnt be in a film you could create a mountain directed to the gods just out of the pile of  this movie throws down at you mind you this movie has some good points the ending was magnificent especially when the curtains closed on this stunning film and everyone started clapping in awe of the awesomeness that is packed into this phenomenal creation its not joss whedons fault if anything its marvels egotistic attempts to blow apart their wallets with the amount of money they manage to make from this one film it really teaches you what some flashes and a few of your favourites can do to create a fanboy paradise full of jawdropping boredom that will leave you wondering why you ever torrented this or spent those 20 dollars on an utter pile of ,fantasy
the might be a good follow up to five essentially unrelated movies that ties all the characters together and it might have great action but it suffers at the hands of joss whedon who should never be allowed near movies againthe writing is corny and melodramatic the villain has a cookiecutter motivation i want to get the macguffin so i can take over the world because im better which seems to be the case in these films loki was entirely forgettable as a villain the scenes between black widow and hawkeye and phil coulson and nick fury had cringeworthy dialog and delivery one thing i noticed which ive never noticed before in a movie was that the lighting in all the indoor sections was really bad it made everything look like it was from 2004nobody acted well in this movie but the three worst offenders were scarlett johansson samuel l jackson and mark ruffalo all three are good actorsactresses but scarlett was completely wooden as black widow jackson was corny as hell as fury and ruffalo reeked of a high schooler trying to remember his lines for the school play all three of them have put in excellent performances before especially ruffalo in zodiac but here they all  the bed robert downey jr also put in his most obnoxious tony stark performance yet mostly due to the horrible unfunny oneliners he was given that kind of sums up the oneliners everyone even the god of thunder himself mostly just spews oneliners at each other every character is tony stark even captain americathere were good things though the fact that most of the conflict involved the and their infighting was a great idea the action was really well done especially the helicarrier scene in which everything that could possibly go wrong went wrongthe had some good action and isnt that enough well not its not not when your movie is two and a half hours an hour and a half of which being dialog there are better movies in this series like both captain america movies the first iron man and the incredible hulk if people like this movie thats fine im fairly picky so im probably being too hard on it but to me this movie is highly overrated much like the franchise in general,fantasy
now i watched this film in south korea when it came out in 4d yes 4d the chairs moved and everything so perhaps the movie may have been more enjoyable for me than someone watching it on their phone on the subway or whatever but i think its a great action film so its not citizen kane or some film on the criterion eclipse collection but so what it doesnt have to be to be appreciated how many films could be appreciated if those are the standards were aiming for might be mindless visual effects and action stunts in the place of depressing artsy philosophical themes in 60 year old 4 hour long blackandwhite foreign films to some but that doesnt make it absolute crapthe point of this film was not to redefine existentialism or educate people on einsteins theory of general relativity the point of this film was to entertain and it did exactly that not everything has to be deep and intellectual to be considered good and the thing is isnt even dumb its an action film with more than the factor of bloodpumping adrenaline in mind if you want dumb action check out tango and cash is an action film and it glorifies the genre tremendously well,fantasy
marvels the is an action packed must see cinematic masterpiece alan silvestris soundtrack was very heavenly it made my parents and i really excited when we saw this at the theater in my opinion this is the best soundtrack and theme hes done so farthe story in this movie was amazing and was better than i expected joss whedon and zak penn did a brilliant job of writing this movie they shouldve gotten an oscar nominationthe sound effects blew me away the crashing punching and bombing sounds will make your jaw dropthe sets and locations looked so realistic including the space scenes it makes you feel like your in the moviethe way the worked together was thrilling because there were so many superheros with different powers that united and fought as oneto me the was the best marvel film of 2012,fantasy
it takes effort and skill to pull off a project like thistwenty years ago marvel had comic characters that translated into poor films while dc had batman and superman moviesnow marvel films have a juggernaut they released their second tier superheroes thor captain america to great acclaim and it all lead up to the film where the characters of the marvel cinema universe convergediron man as portrayed by robert downey jr is the main man with his witty one liners and conflicting with the more straight up captain america there is a lot of substance with mark ruffalos dr banner keeping his alter ego monster at bayjoss whedon as co writer and director balances action adventure and laughseach of the character gets his time in the sun loki is the malevolent presenceno wonder the film was a behemoth at the box office,fantasy
the from last year is an amazing movie with such a wonderful cast of actors from all over the place set in new york this exciting action packed movie is full of tense moments and wonderful scenes the talent of the actors and everyone who helped create the movie made it such an awesome movie to watch heros unite to stop an alien invasion caused by loki in turn to get back at his brother thor chris hemsworth if i was an actor this would of been my first movie to audition for as a lover of action moviesall in all its a must watch for all those action movie fans an exciting new adventure in the marval universe packed full of action scenes and excitement a fantastic movie to watch and will watch again,fantasy
 its a wow totally magnificent i honestly dont know where to start this movie is really the definition of a success superhero a movie not only because there are multiple superheroes from each previous individual movies coming together but mostly because of the actions thats put into it when we think of superheroes the first thing we thought is that they have abilities and they defeat the bad guys and automatically our brain pictures a lot of actions well this movie successfully collect all that criteria in a 2 hour and 13 minute movie its totally a ride i was on the edge of my seat as i watched it the first time everyone must see it and for those who havent please go see it although not every female audience would enjoy it but a big chance that they would great and awesome movie totally marked the legacy for superhero movies,fantasy
as thors hammer smashes the ground causing huge ripples in the earth the smashing action blows your mind as it leaves a deep impact on you way after the film is over one of the most awaited films of the year the is everything youd expect from a highvoltage superherogettogether filmit really is quite something that was able to take so many characters and put them into a movie where nobody gets left behindone of the ten best films of 2012the does not fall short of anything stunts story performances humourthe film has it all and just in the right proportion humour is in abundance but no way does it make the film spooflike the banter between the superheroes is as interesting as their fight with the aliens joss whedon leaves you emotionally invested in the movieyou feel for the characters which makes the film a roller coaster ride you dont want to miss out on,fantasy
i absolutely loved this movie and ive probably seen it about seventeen times i practically died when phil died i loved phil i think scarlett was the perfect black widow this movie had some of my favorite super heroes in it i loved when the one lady shouted grenade i thought loki was the perfect villain in this movie i loved seeing how well the characters fit together thor and lokis fight scene was pretty intense but i loved it i loved pretty much everything in this movie and i cant stop watching it i am super excited about the next movie coming out in 2015 and i can say i will definitely be watching it as soon as it comes out in theaters and on dvd,fantasy
i absolutely loved this movie whats not to love honestly the characters in it are iron man the hulk thor captain america black widow hawkeye and nick fury it is one of my favourite movies ever based in new york the take dowwnnn loki to get the beloved tesseract which is a powerful energy source of unknown potential the are torn over how to approach loki and the discovery that shield plans to harness the tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against extraterrestrialsgo watch it now d you will absolutely love it you wont regret it,fantasy
nick fury brings together earths mightiest heroes to stop loki who is unleashing an alien invasionrobert downey jr makes this good and joss whedon makes this great downey has already shown that hes a movie star he could power a whole franchise all by himself but the is more than just a one man team this is a quintessential joss whedon scooby gang and hes great at the snappy dialog and friendhate comradry this is a whole team of heroes working togetherbecause of its timing this will be compared to the dark knight rises most seems to give tdkr more credit because of its darker grittier tone both are great but i like better honestly tdkr is inferior to tdk there are logic problems with tdkr there are too many comicbook moves in that film its melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations the is simply better written its dialog is better it may be simplistic but its more fun,fantasy
the is a great action movie people of all ages would enjoy especially geeks and fans of comics hulk thor captain america iron man and others are all in it the movie is actionpacked with amazing special effects but with the traditional storyline one would expect from similar films however it is not the storyline that defines this movie but the rich interactions of all these superhero characters as they try to work together to save the worldthe is entertaining with many funny moments oneliners unexpected events and even long fights between the superheroes themselves however the movie progresses very slowly which is a bit frustrating for a movie packed with superstars and a runtime of two hours and 23 minutes although i appreciate the directors work in taking enough time to present the unique and complex personality of every character in the story the cast also does a great job with the characters and each of the superheroes gets their own chance to shine throughout the story although you can see the directors unique passion towards the iron man and hulk characters  joss whedon wrote the screenplay and directed the filmin short the movie is long but great and if you like marvels superheroes this is definitely the movie for you,fantasy
the 2012 a movie nearly a decade in the assembling yes pun intendedfk you if you dont think its funny is a kick ass movie through and through what all the fan boys have been waiting for and showing average audiences why comicbook story archs are so entertaining and can make exciting movies the movie begins where captain america the first avenger 2011 thor 2011 iron man 2 2010 and the original movie and the incredible hulk 2008 led us to an assembly of marvel a spectacle unlike any superhero movie or movie period has before loki thors adopted brother has come to earth via shield tampering with a magic cube known as the tesseract which he inturn steals from the agency along with converting hawkeye jeremy renner and dr selvig stellan skarsgrd to the dark side with a magic spear he has brought with him nick fury samuel l jackson sees no alternative to fight this god from another dimension than to restart the avenger initiative and bring together the worlds finest heroes iron mantony stark robert downey jr recently thawed out captain america chris evans black widow scarlett johansson and to track the tesseract with his knowledge of gamma radiation dr bruce banner mark ruffalo who just for good measure happens to morph into a huge green monster when hes aggravateddirector joss whedon handles the film with finesse and the movie lives up to expectations all around the 3d presentation is excellent and really stands out during the climax which i have to commend joss whedon and those responsible for setting it during the day helping the 3d stand out so many of these type of movies set the end showdown at night and it was a nice change besides being beneficial to the 3d,fantasy
this movie was the best iv ever experienced in a long time in thor thors father odin took the power from demons called the frost giants their power was called tesseract a small piece of the tesseract fell to earth and the tesseract was not found till in 1945 when howered stark found it under the ocean nick fury needed a scientist named eric selvic to study the cube but one day thors evil brother loki leaked out of the portal created by the tesseract and causes destruction fury goes on a mission to assemble a group of super heros thor iron man captain america halkeye black widow  the hulk this movies performance directing and effects were great this is a movie that deserves a sequel,fantasy
i honestly think this is one of the coolest movies everall of the action in the movie and the evil villain were all amazing the special effects though were not cheesy at allthis is a great movie the cinematography was great the effects were amazing and the acting was amazing i think this is definitely one of marvels best movies everthe ending was so strong i can not wait for the sequel and what will happen in that filmi think we all love this movie and we probably all agree to what i said about the actors cinematography etci love marvel,fantasy
in the decade its taken to bring everything together weve continually been promised that the would be the superhero movie to change all superhero movies and its a damn good thing because i really hate superhero movies three things made this film standout and shine over the many many superhero films that have been released the most obvious thing is the huge superstar cast not only is it incredibly difficult to bring a cast like this together but to get them to work together without getting in each others way must have been nearly impossible second even though the film involves superheroes and outer space it seems somewhat realistic to us these heroes have families personalities feelings people get hurt and some people even die letting us see the human side of these characters finally the direction of joss whedon brings it all together whedon has always had this unique ability to put his own style on spin on things at first it seems strange but ultimately we come to love it he is such an underrated director who brings so much to everything hes a part of and its great to see him get to do a huge project like this the was special not only because it took a decade to make but because if you saw all the individual movies first like i did you feel a connection to these guys its almost like you know them personally and you expect them to act in certain ways when they all come together the individual films really built up the excitement and helped the to become a billion dollar earner at the box office from the performances to the special effects this was once exciting terrific movie and may be as close to perfect as a superhero movie will ever get,fantasy
the definitely had the house riding on it marvel set up the film for success releasing solo pictures of each character in the group with varying degrees of quality from pretty good iron man to terrible iron man 2 fortunately the rest of those prequels were in the good to above average range laying out a huge amount of hype for the granddaddy to outshine them allon that level the definitely does not disappoint it is a leading candidate for the best marvel movie thus far the other two being x2 and xmen first class showcased by an excellent script and easy chemistry between the ensemble cast it would probably be expected to think that robert downey jr as iron man is in a league by himself here but he is actually outshined by mark ruffalo and tom hiddleson bruce bannerhulk and loki respectivelyruffalo is spot on as bruce banner bringing an easygoing nature to a role that was played with much more brooding by both eric bana and edward norton the laid backness offers the yin to hulks destructive yang adding needed context to the misunderstood heros backstoryhiddleson continues to impress as the troubled loki thirsty to drink vengeance against his brother thor chris hemsworth and willing to enslave thors beloved earth to do so most movie adaptations of marvel villains are pretty simple affairs but hiddleson wills viewers to fully understand the depth of his hatred and propensity for chaoschris evans is fine as captain america although the fact that he plays the human torch in the fantastic four another marvel franchise bothers me greatly im sure there are other actors who can carry caps shield so to speak samuel jackson jeremy renner and scarlett johansson reprise their roles as nick fury hawkeye and black widow to round out the crew and add another layer of bad assness to the filmthe plot here is standard comic book fare loki has teamed with a group of alien baddies to steal the power of some sort of cosmic cube that fury is hanging onto and the need to stop him before the world goes to poop its not important to explain the story as much as it is to note that joss whedon is proving he is a master of the spectacular is the type of summer movie the season is made for and fully worthy of the box office receipts it tallied,fantasy
i believe that the was the most riskiest project ever marvel took 4 years to bring the to the big screen it is not an easy job to make a movie with such iconic characters joss whedon did a perfect job with these characters loki is my second favorite super villain of all time next to joker of course after the im looking forward to all the marvel phase 2 movies they are doing a great job not to mention iron man 3 it was a disaster it is so much fun to watch these characters interact and hulk steals this show like taking a candy from a baby the dialogues were perfect and yes the is awesometacular,fantasy
this movie was good all the way through when i first saw the trailers for thor and captain america i didnt think the actors looked like they fit the parts this movie has the advantage of coming out after weve already had time to see the individual movies learn the origin stories and get used to the actors and costumes i still didnt think chris evans was a good choice but by this point i can look past it it had to be really hard to find a way to make a character as unremarkable as loki into a villain worthy of being the main antagonist but i ended up really enjoying hiddlestons performance he might be one of those performers that i like watching in anything he does the movie was long enough to feel appropriately epic but never dragging the visuals were all great especially the technology this movie the amazing spiderman and rise of the planet of the apes all have science labs that look like they were designed by the same team with lots of blue holograms and transparent screens i hope everyone who worked on this one can all get it together for at least one more movie because this one was really fun,fantasy
when you stick iron man the hulk thor and captain america in a film you know its not going to be a walk in the park with tea and scones on a bench and indeed there is so much destruction here that when the dust settles i was amazed to see anything standing at all true they may save the earth but i bet the property damages in doing so run into the billions any insurance guy watching this would have five simultaneous cardiac arrests so if you fall into that category best to stay home and plan some more obnoxious ads for daytime but thats another storythere are laughs aplenty too with tony starks aka iron man flippant comments steve rogerss aka captain america fishoutofwater situation the hulks aka bruce banner efforts not to get mad and thors aka er thor utterly straightlaced persona the clash of personalities and their different methods of dealing with the opposition just add to the fun and samuel l jackson has his best role in ages as the eyepatched hardasnails leader who puts them together there is also another member played by scarlet johansson called the black widow but i apologise for saying that her part felt like tokenism to pacify all you feminists out there sorry girls now make a peanut butter sandwich and finish the washing up slaps her bottomtheres never a dull moment and all the money is there on the screen or in the cayman islands accounts of the stars bit of advice though turn the sound down unless you want your neighbours to complain be a good citizen and get used to loads more superhero movies coming out in the near future as long as the standard remains this high though who am i to complain 710,fantasy

the experience of watching with my friends in 3d was unique this movie made me wanna celebrate the victory of over dark forces in the cinema joss whedon did it againmade the most entertaining superhero movie with sheer awesomeness all the superheroes did a good jobloki made a great villain tom hiiddlestons cunning and nasty smile breathes life in his character of evil chris hemswothchris evansjeremy renerscarlett johanssonrobert downy jrsamuel l jackson and mark ruffalomeans all were amazing in their roles exceptthe hulk stole the showespecially in the scene where hulk grab loki and smack him on the floor there are many other funny scenes this movie got style great effects and execution this is a perfect summer movie,fantasy
i was fully expecting to not like this movie because i havent thought much of iron man or captain america movies but the story behind this film was better than i expected also you need to have seen previous superhero movies to get this movie especially thor loki thors evil brother comes to earth to lead an alien invasion and its up to the superheros to stop him the black widow and hawkeye have very little to do and could have been left out so basically the heroes are chasing loki around until the invasion when there is a huge battle at the end the battle was cool with cool computer effects this is when the hulk gets to play his big part but the main heroes in the film were thor and ironman and captain america gets to make a few decisions toofinal verdict ok action flick but you need to know about the previous superhero movies to get this one,fantasy
the is a huge project considering the number of films leading up to it marvels superhero flicks have been centered around a sexy cast and a fastpaced plot rather than emotional or intellectual depth comparing poorly to nolans batman films the ends up being stronger than its predecessors in that it doubles the amount of fun with its superb character roster and has wittier dialogue but falls short of a superhero masterpiecethe film plays with the dynamics of the characters and the actors and uses humorous twists and joss whedons trademark cut to technique to great effect the first half of the film after the pointless prologue is a joy to watch  it reminds me of the fun i had with the first pirates of the caribbean film after that there is a lengthy war scene against generic alien invaders during which the film doesnt lose focus from its character chemistry but starts to drag a littlethe plot is rubbish thinly disguised as philosophy lokis speech about human subordination as the film is mostly constructed on visual and verbal gags i feel it doesnt hold up on a second viewing  after all a joke is funny only on the first telling,fantasy
the is a movie that appeals to the senses no not touch or taste but with so many special effects great sounds quality and so many different scene set ups it makes you feel like youre actually there in the movie fighting alongside with the hey you might even give yourself a super hero name to make you feel like one of the crew style is much different than many other super hero movies that there has been in the past marvel has struck gold with the concept that they have brought forth to the millions of fans of their superhero army every child had that one super hero that they wanted to be as a kid while they were growing up yeah marvel has given each one of these heroes their fame separately but that way is a thing of the past whats better to hit two birds with one stone you might ask how about ten birds with one stone thats what the creators did when they brought together all of your child hood heroes into one movie just the idea is pure genius yeah a single character may appeal to wide audience but having multiple characters with millions of followers that would want to see their movie all together equals big money so thats why the concept of this movie as a whole is a win for the marvel company the way that all of the characters in this film were brought together was a great way to bring the viewer up to date even if the viewer didnt watch one marvel movie or pick up a comic book before this could comprehend what was going on marvel introduced one character at a time so that the viewer would not get all jumbled up and they would also show where the character has been of that time not just by plucking them from thin air now on to the bad of the movie it was very hard to find the bad in this movie but there were a few things that could be pointed out the fact that marvel decided to only go with a select few of their characters and not bring all of them into this movie could have been heart breaking for all of those batman fans out there or even the little kid with his spiderman underwear but except for those few and very small details the is a must see,fantasy
youre larger than life you have abilities beyond that of most human beings on the planet then the world finds itself in peril and to save it youll need to join a group of people just as unique as you if not more so what do you doshield agent nick fury played by samuel l jackson is overseeing a top secret project designed to study an energy source from another world known as the tesseract the experiment soon goes awry and the tesseract appears to explode in actuality it has opened a portal allowing the malevolent being known as loki played by tom hiddleston to emerge its almost immediately clear that shield is outmatched and whats worse the supervisor of the tesseract project dr erik selvig played by stellan skarsgard and experienced covert agent nicknamed hawkeye played by jeremy renner became mindless drones under lokis hiddlestons command once the facility is destroyed and the invaders have moved on fury jackson calls agent natasha romanoff also known as the black widow scarlet johansson to recruit one member of the the initiative was abandoned some time before the events depicted in this film but is reactivated for the sake of mankind and for lack of a better alternative romanoff johansson is next seen in india resorting to subterfuge to gain audience with bruce banner played by mark ruffalo banner ruffalo has gone into hiding to escape opportunists in the american government to remain calm to spare the world and those around him any damage he might inflict as the hulk next to be approached by shield is iron man tony stark played by robert downey jr in the characters third major film the last member left to recruit is steve rogers played by chris evans more commonly known as captain america when theyre finally brought together banner and stark are tasked with tracing the energy source and in so doing locating the enemy when thats accomplished they meet yet another traveler from worlds beyond thor played by chris hemsworth lokis brothernow i was not really a fan of captain america the first avenger nor was i altogether pleased after seeing thor as for bruce banners larger half perhaps its impossible to make a film about the incredible hulk that i wouldnt like first there was the ang lee eric bana film then the edward norton film both of which i enjoyed still i did like ruffalo also thor captain america and the black widow made individual contributions to enrich the story hiddleston may not be as physically imposing as chris hemsworth but as an egomaniacal extraterrestrial he is truly terrifying i cant comment on whether the 3d effects added anything as i saw it in 2d but regardless the was incredible the one thing i might say was lacking was iron mans best friend james rhodes wearing an armored flight suit of his own and going by the name war machine we caught a glimpse of that suit in action in iron man 2 but it was nowhere to be seen here and i thought the film was worse off for it still very exciting highly entertaining and one great ride see it,fantasy
a for the i must say from the film the i believe it is one of the best action hero movies ever made i expected it to be a great movie for the simple fact that they had the hulk  thor  and several other big name heroes in it but this movie really blew me away with how they constructed it the way they brought all the characters together in the storyline  and had them all be able to connect and shows that each knew of each other already to me was amazing the film also brought a lot of action and one on one fights which i believe everyone who is a fan of these films loved because the question is always asked who the best superhero is but besides the fighting each other there were a lot of action in new york that just blows your mind the nonstop adrenaline anticipating what will happen next just have you on the edge of your seat biting your finger nails i believe the actorsactresses did an amazing job on portraying these characters they really brought them to life and interconnect them i personally never saw thor the movie but he brought it in this movie to where i didnt need to go watch that movie first thor and hoki had a moment where it explains what they are and who they are i like how they brought that out it really makes the film that much better and also i like how when they go to recruit it shows a little about every person but not too much these characters were played at their best costumes and props where amazing from iron mans new suits to captain america actually still wearing his new suite in the current life and thors hammer that you believed was real from the sound effects the brought there a game with this film creating a reflection flying ship that looks invisible the new technology they brought to this movie i would have never thought of one last thing i liked how they showed the departing and going back to their daily lives but also leaves you to think maybe there will be another movie guess we will just have to wait and see for ourselves but if so it also leaves you wondering just what will the second film be about since that just swept everything ive imagined it to be,fantasy
amazing revolutionary and exuberantly humorous are just 3 statements that describe this action packed but surprisingly complex plotted blockbuster movie this film brings together the characters from the marvel comic book series the and gives you the action and effects of a big time movie but still gives you a comic book feel when this movie came out i was swamped with work and did not have enough time for a movie i worked hard and finally got a small window on a friday night to see a single film luckily for me my friends were planning a fun night that included seeing the when they invited me i felt extremely lucky that this coincidently corresponded with my free time when we got there i knew it was going to be a fantastic movie even though the had been out for weeks the movie theater was packed me and my friends got front row seats and experienced the full gripping action this movie had to offer this is definitely a movie to see with friends because of the humor as people would expect if they have seen the previous movies tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr tells the most jokes many of these jokes are based off of rivalries such as the one that develops between captain america and tony stark during the course of the movie captain america feels order is needed in the and that there should be a more established chain of commands this conflicts directly with tony starks spontaneous and freedom loving attitude the clash results in humorous jiving comments from both heroes there was also overall humor between all the character s making the movie wonderfully diverselike all super hero movies there was an abundance of action the difference that made this movie stand out however is the twisting storyline in the beginning you discover that thors brother loki has received an ancient power from an alien race that is after the tesseract a cube of unlimited power that is in the united states possession the strange otherworldly powers these creatures have and their forms give marvel studios a chance to put their graphic arts to the test also producers had to use imagination and skill to fashion the battle scenes throughout the movie marvel made these scenes so that they feel like you are reading a moving comic book the action scenes throughout the movie never disappointwhile the action and humor of this film are good many people have complained that the beginning drags on a bit many super hero movies get right to the action while this one links all the stories before you see this movie i suggest to see the other origin avenger hero movies this will make the beginning more interesting lastly the deep plot is like the icing on top of the cake this movie brings the attitudes of all the characters together and shows how they fit together the main part of the story is about the characters finding out how they work together you can even sympathize for the villain loki who is always in his brothers shadowin the end this is the best action movie i have ever seen even the second third and fourth time i watched the i found some joke underlying plot or important turning point that i hadnt seen this multilayered plot is the foundation of great movies on the other hand many action movies have amazing structures or great affects and battles it is very rare that you find one with both foundation and and a structure together in one move but one without the other is useless the is a sturdy building that will survive a long time in the neighborhood of movies,fantasy
well finally the big one they all come together and assemble iron man hulk thor and captain america come together with hawkeye  black widow to take down loki i saw this at the cinema not in 3d and i really enjoyed it the way i put the trailer clips together into a story in went completely a different way which i was glad of i enjoyed how they did it and how they brought them together and how they disagree and then find out they need each other there are a few twists in this that i really wasnt expecting the dialogue in this movie absolutely awesome and so funny more jokes and hilarious quips than i expected which were really good im glad it wasnt really bad and it was the complete opposite as there are no origin stories and its just the even people who havent seen the rest of the mcu i think will enjoy it as there isnt much depth and a lot is explained like why the hulk is why he is and how they found cap alive so with very slight back stories and awesome plot i will get this dvd and everyone else needs to too yes right now go httptheojreviewsblogspotcouk,fantasy
i thought this was a very good movie but it would of been a lot better if they had the original hulk inside the movie i didnt think the new hulk does any justice looks abit fake to be honest plus edward nortan is a much better actor the effects for the old hulk was also better other then that the story line was great and it was good to see all those characters in 1 movie cant wait for the second movie it should be even better then the first hopefully some new characters will be introduced into the movie if you are a marvel fan you will not be disappointed i got a feeling the next installment of the movie will have something to do with red skull as i dont think he was killed but only sent to the future overall very good movie i rate it at least 7 out of 10,fantasy
this is a very entertaining movie the characters are well known and the plot is simple and effective this movie combines two important ingredients fun and action and the actors are very good too i especially enjoyed scarlett johansson in the role of the black widow she is really talented specially in that leather outfit the computer generated imagery  cgi  is impressive and the idea of the working as a real team surprised me in a positive way the vibrant soundtrack helps a lot in the action scenes chris hemsworth really convinced as thor this movie is good because it is exciting funny and it has some of the nicest super heroes from comic books congratulations hollywood for one of the best movies of the year,fantasy

i was not a big fan of superhero movies because sometimes they can really be pushed a little too far and become unrealistic the on the other hand was pretty amazing i went to go see it 3 times with my friends and family because of its funny lines and good action i sat thru this whole movie 3 times and it still kept me entertained the effects werent anything to complain about and the storyline definitely kept me interested lets hope that the new upcoming sequel will be an improvement because they really raised the bar on the i recommend this movie for everyone you can take your kids to go see this and theyll love it and if you take your grandparentswell they might just be entertained by the cool technology they didnt have in their day  go check this one out guys its worth it,fantasy
this film can only be rated in contrast with other superhero movies and as such its above average the only way it can be described is a marvel extravaganza when one gladiator doesnt excite the crowd anymore you bring out the whole ludusbut of course what many people forget about comic book superheroes is that they came from well comic books they have stories that people have thought out long before there was any idea of making a movie not the best literature can provide but something like character development and a plot so if you bring all these stories together youd better be careful how you do iti am glad to say that the did not botch this the story was reasonable the fighting scenes were epic even if totally unrealistic the special effects grandiose but not overly so the motivational speeches and ridiculous pomposity down to a minimum and there were even some funny jokes in all in all i had fun watching the film,fantasy
the is one of the better movies i have seen come out in a while it had good characters good directing great action scenes and a good storynever before have i seen hollywood produce several movies all intending to hype and lead up to a teamup movie thats what happened here the incredible hulk thor captain america and iron man were all clearly made with this intention of eventually making a grand collaboration movie that featured the stars of each movie this was a very risky move but i do believe it paid offthe story mainly follows the events that bring the together thors brother loki has come to earth to claim a very object for an alien race and let them take over earth in exchange for him becoming the new ruler of course the previously mentioned superheroes come together one at a time in a bid to prevent this from ultimately happeningsomewhat clich story but the chemistry between the characters and the action is where its at not only to all of the main stars do well in their roles but they do a very good job interacting with each in ways that fit their personality tony stark and captain america clash over their conflicting virtues and lifestyles everyone feels a bit wary of the hulk because of how his powers work and so onand the action scenes are downright incredible this is a shining example of how one creates epic battles surrounding superheroes the action scenes are grand awesome brutal and entertaining as hell to watch they are chaotic but you are always able to see clearly what is going on many action moves that create such massive battles just make cluttered messes that make it hard to see what is going on here all the characters can be distinguished and they fight using their abilities to their advantagesthis movie is not for everyone if youre a person that is not really into the comic book movies or the superhero flicks this wont change your mind it is a comic book adaptation and does not attempt to hide that fact with the characters all wearing their colorful uniforms and such plus the story while good is rather clich and typical of a superhero style plot but if you are a fan of superhero films action films or comic book movies this is an absolute must to watch you will not be disappointed,fantasy
while the dark knight with christian bale is possibly the best superhero movie of the 21st century this first installment of the group of marvel heroes known as the is a decent addition to the canon unlike other groups of superheros such as the fantastic four and the xmen several of the were previously superheros in their own right in previous incarnations the oldest is captain america who first appeared in the 1940s and fought against the axis powers during world war ii both iron man and the wasp appeared previously in marvels tales to astonish in 1962 and thor appeared first in marvels journey into mystery also in 1962 the hulk like captain america appeared previously in his own comic book in 1962 like the original comic book published in 1963 this film of the has them battling thors adopted and wayward brother loki who are part of a race of beings called the asgardiansthe film begins with american scientists working on a strange cubeshaped artifact the tesseract which seems to have come from another dimension we later learn it was discovered in the ocean nick fury a kind of ciaagent superhero in the marvel universe played by samuel jackson heads the operation in a secluded compound which would give the pentagon a run for its money the tesseract appears to have powers beyond the comprehension of the mere mortals who cant stop working on the darn thing of course that doesnt stop them from playing with something out of their league sort of the sf equivalent of the rings from the lord of the rings however instead of taming the cube the scientists inadvertently open a kind of portal to another dimension the realm of asgard the world where thor hails from and out pops loki replete with a grin which would make medusa turn to stone the grin alone lets us know from the getgo the baddie of the story he also wields a magical spearsword thingie which either turns you to mush or makes you one of his zombieminions like a boot squashing insects loki makes mince meat out of the operatives and their security hypnotizes a few not the least of which turns out to be the green arrow grabs the tesseract and then melts down their entire complex all within less time then it takes to order and receive a cup of coffee at your local coffee shopnick fury engages the avenger initiative to bring the members together gradually each of the superheros who will make up the appears each engaged in some sort of situation which defines their character and their abilities i thought that each of their situations were enough to let us know who they were and what kind of powers they have without dwelling on it too much eventually iron man captain america the black widow and the hulk are summoned to shield their headquarters a kind of flying aircraft carrier their plan is to capture loki and find the tesseract natasha aka the black widow scarlett johansson iron man robert downey jr and captain america chris evans accomplish the first goal relatively easily when loki infiltrates a party of the uppercrust in stuttgart germany at first he gets a whole crowd of germans on their knees until captain america stops the show while on their way back thor comes flying out of the sky from asgard and grabs loki from out from under iron man at first thor and loki have their deep discussion avoiding such topics as the weather then iron man comes back on the scene and he begins battling with thor contending he should stay out of their dilemma captain america interrupts their fight and eventually loki is taken to shield which appears to be where loki wants to be and thor accompanies themfor me this is where the fun really begins when the members come together with their prisoner they appear at odds with one another the iron man out of costume begins a kind of rhetorical oneupmanship with captain america and the heroes begin taking different sides dr david banner aka the incredible hulk played by mark ruffalo when he isnt green sides with iron man while captain america and thor appear to be at odds with everyone although nick fury tries desperately to keep everything civil we begin to learn this is part of lokis plan even though he is held captive and yet he seems strangely complacent as if everything is working to his plan from there everything literally begins to unravela great very entertaining installment in the marvel universe of 21st century films all the cast members are terrific but the best and most interesting lines not to mention the most memorable moments are between david banner the hulk and iron man captain america is just how you expect him righteous in the morality department but rather onedimensional in the rhetorical department the only shortcoming i thought was the character of nick fury who seemed like he needed a few more offcolor lines like jacksons previous character in pulp fiction he seemed just a little too straightforward the ending is foreshadowed somewhat in the middle but it all works definitely a must for marvel fans,fantasy
the movie weve all been waiting for the movie we never thought we would no doubt im talking about the it stars robert downey jr as iron man chris evans as captain america chris hemsworth as thor mark ruffalo as hulk and now the highest box office actor ever samuel l jackson as nick fury the story is about thors half brother loki who is trying of course to take over the world the story is flaud but then counter on it well because they talk more about the stories of the superheros and the things they must overcome so its a smart way to counter on such a small story the characters in the film are developed well they take there time with the movie which is why its two and a half hours long at times it drags out but counters with highly entertaining action and special effects robert downey jr carries the film well and samuel l jackson being the veteran in the movie both give solid performances and care deeply about there characters mark ruffalo gives us a hulk worth cheering for because of the lacking performances from eric bana and edward norton worth seeing no doubt currently out in theaters see it,fantasy
tremendous hype surrounding a movie can be a very good thing usually it guarantees some big box office numbers for at least the opening weekend but this is not always the case the downside to so much hype around a movie is that many people tend to make up their minds before even setting foot in the theater when this happens it takes a very well made movie to up peoples expectations three weeks ago one of the most hyped movies if not the most hyped movie of the year opened with the opening weekend in the us it opened throughout the world the week before broke every opening weekend recored taking in 207 million it would go on to make another 100 million in its second weekend and cruise to 1 billion world wide in no time at all this for all purposes is a movie that lived up to the hype and morei chose to let the hype die down before viewing the movie for review purposes so as not to get caught up in everything but the movie yesterday was the day to view the and try not to get caught up in the avenger stormbased on the comic book which is a compilation of several different comic book characters the is a secret team of superheroes put together should the world be on the brink of disaster there wouldnt be much of a movie if the world didnt come to the brink of disaster when thors brother loki comes to earth to obtain the most precious source of energy in the world known as the tesseract when loki controls the mind of some of shields personnel to help with his sinister plot director nick fury initiates the program after some difficult persuading the do in fact come together the movie climaxes with an epic battle throughout new york citywith the possibility of this movie being an epic failure director joss whedon was very fortunate to have actors from each of their respective characters films with the exception of the hulk who had two different bruce banners but was superbly cast with mark ruffalo the talent and good acting by each person in their roles helped tremendously with the success of this film with robert downey jr all but leading the cast as iron mantony stark in a role he has really come to own each one was exactly who was needed for their roles the introduction of jeremy renner as hawkeye was a great choice he is on the rise in popularity and a fine actor in his own rightthe story is not one that is complex and difficult to follow it is almost the quintessential superhero story line that has every twist and close call we have come to know and love with these types of movies dont look for a surprise ending but also dont expect to be bored with a plot line that is too simple the purpose of this movie is the effects and action and just seeing a lot of favorite superheroes together at once and joss whedon executes that perfectlyit is a fun exciting 2 12 hours and money well spent for the 2d we did not see the 3d its everything everyone wants in a summer blockbuster movie it is not hard to see why it is pulling in the money it is it is just another case of giving the movie going audience what they want and making it well there is still the possibility that all the records that the has set could be short lived come the end of july when christopher nolan unleashes his final installment in the dark knight series that aside the up to this point is not only the best summer blockbuster but the best movie so far this year,fantasy
let me preface by saying that i am no fan of superhero movies whether they be from dc or marvel i find that their biggest failing is that they have long action sequences that become dull because you simply cannot identify very deeply with the characters involved this is usually a result of poor character development and hackneyed dialog the abysmal transformers movies and star wars prequels come instantly to mind my wife and i almost fell asleep during the opening scene of revenge of the sith during the long boring space battle fighting and action need context to have an impact on the more discerning viewer the 13year old version of me probably would have enjoyed the aforementioned movies at least a little bit but 34year old me would rather scrape sandpaper over my eyeballs than be subjected to a pointless visual assaultnow with the coming out my wife and i decided that we should probably check it out for 2 reasons joss whedon and robert downey jr when it comes to the superhero genre batman begins and the first iron man sit at the top of our lists iron man was funny engaging and completely owned by downeys personality it was great fun and left the viewer with lasting thoughts and imagery so with this being a jossdowney production for the most part if you dont love at least some of whedons work then you are not on my christmas card list we were excitedwe watched all of the prequels hating iron man 2 and the edward norton hulk movie but loving captain america and thor j michael straczinsky wrote the story for thor and it showed with its depth and scale we are huge babylon 5 fans so we simply had to see it if you have yet to see the the only absolutely necessary prequel is thor you really must see it for critical story elements to truly appreciate the the rest of the prequels you can afford to miss but iron man and captain america are both great and it would help to some extent to see them before the after seeing all of the prequels we were ready to jump into the last night in 3d imax on a 72 foot screen not that fake imax experience crap on a 25 foot screen and we had a grand ole timethe movie pretty much starts where thor left off storywise and quickly advances the plot whedon ably does this while developing the myriad characters within by the time the obligatory massive action sequences occur you are all in and right there with these heroes i would much rather see story than action personally but the balance was well handled and kept the user engaged at all levels throughout humor and drama were well balanced as well with every character bringing some humor but downey stealing the show as he was destined to do we were never bored and the 2 and half hours flew by my wife is a big neil gaiman fan and she felt the the actor who played loki did a near perfect job in both thor and the whedon is the new king of the world910  almost perfect,fantasy
so i finally got to see this earlier today after weeks of hearing about how great it is and how its breaking box office records blah blah blah i watched the trailer several times and thought it looked like fun then it opened and people were saying how much of a great film it actually is  so my interest started to grow from will watch it at some point to i need to see what the fuss is about  and thats what i did this morningall the characters work out great especially the sparring relationship between thor and the hulk as well the bickering between captain america and iron mandirection wise meh by the numbers with a budget this big and the resources available with that sort of money however its the films script that really shines so tightly written theres no throwaway dialoguei think what people have gotten so excited about is the eye candy over anything else and this film is beautiful to look at  but looks fade very quickly and this will soon be added to the pile of cgi heavy films that look kinda dated and hammy compared to the next big thing overall nice to look and a great script but lacks the weight and enduring impact it should have i understand iron man 3 comes out next year and that will no doubt eclipse the memory of this like i said in the title its just more fluff610,fantasy
i think this is a must watch movie i am not a big fan of superhero movies even tough i watched it because my friends dragged me to watch it and i must say i didnt get bored a single second of it the action is awesome and the dialogs makes the movies one of the funniest movies ever the credit should go to iron man and hulk who makes it all happen through out the story just two words simply amazing there is no big difference in 3d and normal screens but imax should make it look even better my rating for the movie on a scale of 1 to 10 action  9 comedy  10 story  9 overall  10 because it is an excellent movie i would recommend you to watch the iron man thor captain america movies before watching this if you are not good at understanding english then use subtitles because it would be a shame to miss a hilarious line in it,fantasy
ive never given a 9 rating to any action film well i think i rated avatar pretty high but that had to do with the overt political statement too makes no specific political commentary and that has nothing to do with why i love this film its just an excellent ensemble cast and freekin mega fun the writing and acting make it work thats where most action films are lacking has got genuine wit great subtext and character development dialogue deft banter the way the relationships build is convincing and unforced plenty of camp but well balanced and never becomes mockery and the action is perfect so many action films try to dazzle so much you cant tell whats going on the goes totally ballistic in the concluding battle but you can always tell exactly whats happening on screen i am not going to go deep ill leave that to the pros and there are already plenty of positive reviews i just wanted to say that this is one of those rare bigbudget action films that lives up to the hype major winner kudos to the makers if the followups are this good the franchise will outlast the cast,fantasy
this is what action adventure is all about yes it is clustered but thats hardly something to criticize this has to be one of the best comic book based movie i have ever seen the main villain is no heath ledgerjoker but loki does work as the main antagonist i think maybe there should have been other well known marvl villains in the movie all the characters work well robert doweny jr and samuel l jackson were at there best a first the team cant get along this is just what loki wants he lets himself get captured to sabotage the group anyone who knows anything about loki knows no mortal prison can hold him thor start off a odds with the rest of the because he wants loki to face justice in asgard loki wants to start a war against earth using a power cube the battle at the end was amazing there are so many action scenes this is what superhero action movies are all about its not dark and edgy its a fun ride for anyone who hasnt seen it yet but wants to i am not going to spoil it but dont leave the theater before the first set of credits are over i give it a ten and hope to see part 2,fantasy
there was no secret of the highly populated cast in the lead up to the taking into account the hype since the release of iron man in 2008 the success of iron man was followed by a sequel in 2010 fans of the super hero franchise where greeted with the release of two more comic book movies thor and captain america the question was could the succeed as a whole nick fury jackson recruits iron man downey jr thor hemsworth and captain america evans as well as newcomer mark ruffalo as the hulk the super group also consists of two newbies to the big screen black widow is played scarlett johansson and jeremy renner as hawkeye the next bourne the world is under threat following the arrival of loki a citizen of asgard another universe thor 2011 loki is the brother of thor although both would agree the distance between them is not exaggerated it is lokis attack on shield that leads to a crucial decision by nick fury leader of the affiliation the desperate attempt involves regrouping something stronger than loki and his army of cohorts the the movie has a nice feel to it with a brilliant intro of whats to come those who have not seen previous movies wont suffer too much but it does consist of some flashbacks regarding captain americathe storyline is put together smartly and manages to keep the balance in relation to the numerous egos on board as loki is the one at large it feels the story is based off of thor but does well in blending all characters as always robert downey shows class as the arrogant yet hilarious tony stark and the ever so cheesy captain america evans fans will enjoy the rivalry between both captain america and iron man as personalities quickly collide before they realize the moral of the story is teamworkthe return of loki was a great choice as he made for a terrific badguy in thor and the collision between family is still fun to watch although loki seemed a handful in the release of thor in 2010 nick fury and the get caught completely off guard with loki and his mind boggling army the introduction of a third bruce banner is unfortunately frustrating for some but when the hulk is transformed nobody notices yes a third mark ruffalo plays the man with the temper following eric bana and edward norton my favorite by the way mark ruffalo as dr banner had a challenge on his hands is there information on why edward norton was not included instead i believe if he was performance on the bases of acting would have been better than mark ruffalo but just like i said in relation to the fans just want to see the hulk tear people buildings and valuable things apart and that is just what he does my favorite was bruce bannerwhen he was greenmy knowledge in marvel limits but i wonder what fans made of hawkeye and black widow both characters like the rest were highly entertaining jeremy renner is leading an exciting future and scarlett johanssonwell just do what you do best not forgetting samuel jackson even though he has been forgettable in the past he gives fans an enjoyable performance curse free mr jackson just needs to choose his movies carefully in my opinion he has been in some woeful movies latelythe action and cgi makes the what it is in comparison to captain america which i despised and even the previous cgi hulk this blows them out of the water you noticed i excluded both the iron man and thor movies the is still early release and is yet to be decided in my opinionthe is up there with the greatest super hero movies ever made audience from generations will enjoy the whether you are unfortunate to see this movie in 3d or stay classy with 2d one must see immediately the exciting question for the future is what is next to come well we know iron man 3 and a thor sequel is in writing unfortunately captain america also and possibly a new bruce banner who knows in relation to an sequel now thats getting carried awaydid you enjoy my review check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog  httpgerrysreviewsforthosecuriousblogspotcom,fantasy
this movie rules great acting  great sf and awesome 3dthe cinematics are the greatest i have seen this movie is awesome and so funny the hulk is so funny in this movie this movie has so many great scenes the 3d is so good it feels real its better then harry potter its better then forrest gump its better then batman forever and all of them combined it is the ultimate movie i love this movie and would love to watch it again cant wait for many movies i thought about this movie i anit gonna watch it cba but i did and it was the best movie i have seen i recommend you watch this movie worth the pay  this movie is better then lord of the rings but lord of the rings just has that spark it while this movie was not as full as sparkbut still freaking awesome1010  its freakin awesome,fantasy
in 2008 we were treated to a postcredits scene at the end of iron man featuring samuel l jackson making his first appearance as shield leader nick fury this small minute long clip confirmed one thing an movie was happening so here we are four years five films and one name change later we have assemble so was it worth the wait in short yes now youd think that in a film with so many big stars that some of them would end up being sent to the sidelines but every single character gets their moment to shine the only person that does feel a little underused is jeremy renners hawkeye but given his role in the story its understandable and he still makes an impact he could certainly give katniss everdeen a run for her money the hulk hasnt really had much luck when it comes to the big screen currently on his third actor in just under ten years but joss whedon and mark ruffalo have managed to bring the hulk to the big screen in possibly the best way possible and its mostly all down to ruffalos damn good acting hes the first actor to portray both banner and the other guy in the same film and thats a major benefit to have the hulk actually look like his human counterpart this time whereas the versions from ang lees 2003 hulk and louis leterriers 2008 the incredible hulk were both just a big green cgi mess alas there are some downsides to every film and assemble is no exception the opening precredits scene does feel a little unsure and the middle act drags a little bit it was entertaining but i did find myself wondering how long they were going to spend on the helicarrier before something interesting happened finally i arrive at the 3d it wasnt particularly that impressive if im honest i stopped noticing it after about twenty minutes though that probably proves just how good the film was apart from in a select few scenes and even then the screen is too jumbled every time you blink your eyes need to readjust to the image and it becomes blurry id say that if you have the extra money go for 3d but if you opt for a 2d viewing you wont miss much and youll save some money apart from the minor niggles a pretty much perfect film ,fantasy
well if there were any shortcomings offered by this movie the superb cast and their excellent performances hid them additionally i am certain there were massive egos to contend with but the director joss whedon did a superb job keeping that aspect in tow i cant say this movie was well worth the astronomical cost per person nor the wasted time watching tv commercials  but it had more valueforthebuck than some of the other tripe i sat through in the pastthe storyline was fast paced the cgis did not outperform the actorsactresses and the pontifications were eclipsed by things blowing up and all those awful bad guys getting their butts kicked i gladly spent the big bucks to see it in the theater and will purchase a dvd copy that way i can watch it a few more times without breaking the bank this was an excellent swansong for the on that notewould i suggest a sequel no way why spoil a good thing let these starscharacters exit on a positive note as american  wait not just american  but world heroes instead of a bunch of drumbanging narcissists supporting some whimsical divisive hollyweird agenda that only they can afford to care about sorry  that is such a sour note to end with good job or bravozulu one and all,fantasy

overall this film delivers and this compliment comes from a marvel fan though each individual hero remains true to character from their singular franchise the film is nearly a live action cartoon there is a humanism that live action brings to screen that animation lacks its called emotion and marvels noticeably void of it regardless of that critique no one goes for these types of films for ultra realism but more so for the production value great action choreography johanssen is terribly hot in black leather plenty of explosions and the hulk does what he does best smash the idea of some of my favorite heros banding together overcoming inter personal differences during a time of dire need and ultimately saving the day left me satisfied this one is a must see and i recommend paying the extra to watch it in 3d btw dont forget to hang around until the full extent of the credits have passed there are two additional scenes one of which gives clues to a sequel and if youre a marvel fan youll be giddy as a school girl with a bag of lolly pops when you see it,fantasy
putting the quote of dr benner in an ironic manner this movie simply stands out as this years megahit with the perfect chemical mixture of high ordered success not chaos i was not into the whole comics business my entire life but i always enjoyed marvel characters coming alive on screen but how could i have imagined that the admirable characters who were all awesome on their own could have even more impact all gathered together to be honest no matter how much i want to whine about the very predictable storyline that could potentially be the only flaw in this movie i gotta say even the storyline is one of the element that makes this movie glorious i mean come on this is comics it would actually be foolish to expect a complicated storyline if the plot was too complex with twists and all then we cant focus on characters marvel was smart in that they kept the plot simple and sweet for this grand movie with so many great characters  heroes defeat the bad guys no mind gamesnow then our heroes my gosh the untamed and invincible hulk with surprisingly advanced brain proud first avenger captain america with super strength and mighty shield the one and only sassy geniusmechanics master iron man mighty thor the god and guardian of earth handyman hawkeye the archer and the sneaky spies black widow and nick fury so we got all combinations  handiness brain super strength persuasive skills oh and a finishing touch of invincibility when put together they obtain the perfect equation for the dream team i think the thrill and the excitement comes from this perfect combination  filling in the lacking 2 from each characterand of course the coming together of these characters and the exceptional chemistry of the team has to come from superb acting that contributes to creating genuine and believable characters that may even delude audience into thinking they are for real especially for mark ruffalo i gotta apologize to ed norton he did a better and marvellous job of portraying the complete opposite of hulk state  a quiet and introverted genius whom you could never guess to be the most wild and hot tempered monster and robert robert robert he is simply a darling as always smooth talking and adding the perfect comic relief at the right moments  but never losing his cool as iron man when hes on duty all in all this movie would be a legend to comics fans loved loved loved it,fantasy

 was the most ambitious comic book film of all time and that ambition paid off its now the best comic book film of all time bar none no one involved in this production seemed to take anything for granted everyone actors fx people writers director etc all brought their agame it truly is the gem they had promised and truly is a worthy holder of the crownjoss managed to reintroduce characters that we all love make them seem fresh make them seem new and then having them all together without weighting any particular character more than the other hes the master my favorite critic quote that points this out the result is a kitchen sink movie that doesnt feel confused or messy its a genuinely thrilling spectacle with just the right amount of depth laughs humanity and maybe a few more explosions for good measure i cant wait to see this over and over and over again,fantasy
brilliant film this film has good action and quite a few laughs joss whedon is a master of films a must watch i love the way they brought all the characters together awesome movie its great how they placed all the connections in the other movies that led to this movie tony stark is hilarious black widow is fitand a great hero bruce banner is an absolute hero thor is a legend captain america is a great guy if it wasnt for him it probably wouldnt of worked and youve gotta love hawk eye its funny how they all seem to be unbreakablesuch as walking out of a crashed plane with no injuries look forward to the sequel typical marvel to have the bit after the credits but it was essential,fantasy
this was always going to be better than most summer blockbusters because it has continued from established successful films of the iron man series using robert downey jr and although the thor movie wasnt as good  it had a lot to live up to it was good enough and tom hiddlestones loki was an attractive feature for his exceptional performancethe saying is too many cooks spoil the cooking or such like or putting to many eggs in one basket which is the risk in this film as it is full of superheros about 8 has a film ever been loaded with so many inevtitably the film cannot go into detailed back story of each character but the director does try to balance giving each character some previous life which explains leading to their current unionthe reason why there has to be so many heroes all together is that loki has a sinister plan and being a god it is more sinister than usual requiring the combined forces of many heroes to stand any chance of defeating himwhats the film actually like its the best adventure movie this year as expected the cgi and special effects are top of the range but thats doesnt stop transformers from sucking its a proper director that makes a he difference joss whedon directs this and has an amazing track record what made his buffy memorable on television was the emphasis on writing and character its a clich but the fact that hes british and not an american only interested in budget and what special effects can do may be the major factorwhedons writing and demanding that actors do actually act instead of being cardboard cutouts makes this movie better than any action adventure movie who will see this year he includes the psychological factors that the team have very different personalities one of them exploding into green when a bit upset mark ruffalos hulk which is the best performance since the 1970s television series hulk thor and tony stark are the ones who dont know what rules are and get things done their way why should a god listen to puny earthling laws tony stark wouldnt be stark if he didnt do things his own waycaptain america and the other names which people would be less familiar with unless they are marvel fans follow protocols and command structures necessary for captain american defending the american waythe film is a success in every department technical acting writing and directing see it now,fantasy
this isnt a 910 review to talk about how glorious and amazing this movie was its not to go off on a shpiel about how much i loved the and how ive seen it 3 times already i came on imdb to see how the reviews were going and was frustrated by all the negative reviews i sought out to see what insults and injuries people could inflict upon this film because their higher standard of cinematic experiences has made them immune to idiotic tasteless movies like the marvel movies first off the thing i keep reading that is making me rage is reviewers comparing the movie to movies that have made the top 100 movies of all time you cannot compare a comicbased action movie with the shawshank redemption shindlers list or the godfather theyre just not in the same ballpark if you want a serious movie with moving characters deep plot lines and your precious scenery whyre you going to movies like thor and iron mangranted the dark knight was also based on comic books and they actually are very moving and serious but thats just the direction christopher nolan decided to take with the dc comic its predecessors however were just as corny flashy and lame as you claim marvel to be not every superhero film has to be cheesy and clich but they all cant be dark and depressing like the dark knight either most of the comics put our favorite heroes and villains in a humorous light and im glad made me laugh more than i thought it would i didnt want to be traumatized the whole movie like i was with dark knight good traumatized mind yousecondly ive been seeing the movie being compared to movies that everyone else thought were fantastic ones that i and others i know thought were absolute garbage ie xmen origins the spiderman trilogy etc dont be biased in your review dont talk down to everyone else who loved it by saying that another movie was better and that again many and more regard as a waste of time degrading your own review since people will now see what bad taste you have therefore leading others to believe youre no one but a bitter cynical grouch who cannot be cinematically pleased no matter whatthirdly seeing a movie solely based on its reviews is just brainless if you hate action movies or romantic comedies but saw that a new release got great reviews why would you go see what youre very likely to dislike especially since youre biased in your opinion of the subject matter in the first place save your grudge against all mankind for movies you actually care to waste your time onlastly im sorry a lot of bad reviewers see those of us who loved as low iq stupid brainwashed idiots im sorry we dont always crave movies with nothing but plot in depth characters history and challenging puzzles to exercise our brains though admittedly there are a lot of people out there that are like sheep with the marvel movies that go to be entertained like an infant with keys being shaken in front of their faces dont speak about marvellovers as a whole like that some of us are capable of loving all kinds of genres and movie types some even watched it for the sentimental value of being reminded of our childhoods the fact that our comic book characters have been brought to life alone was enough to make us happy i adore my cultural movies but at one point i just really wanted to see a bunch of robots fighting when i saw transformers 3 i was tired of twisted hard to follow plot justwanted to see some robot brutality for a changewhat makes me appreciate the marvel movies all the more is the fact that stan lee is directly involved like he always is with the movies based on his comic books the fact that the marvel movies get his stamp of approval makes me confident that the movie has lived up to the creators expectations and that if he believes it portrays the worlds he has created accurately enough for his fans then thats good enough for meas a closing statement tom hiddleston literally is a god his performance was spectacular phenomenal stellar he cut a breathtaking figure on the silver screen and i was drawn into his character the second he was birthed through the tesseract at the beginning of the film,fantasy
ahhhhhhhhh i watched it yesterday and yeah so late cause of my exams but what a great choice it turned out to watch the movie after all speaking of 3d effect theirs no doubt its one of the best after likes of avatar and tintin now talking about the storyline well it isnt something special just same old story but the execution makes it a different experience mark ruffalo as hulk was incredible and no need to say about iron man the coolest superhero of all i liked the verbal fight between iron man and captamerica agent hawk and black widow were good and thor and captamerica were also good  but for me as i told before hulk and iron man were best to put end to this review one line from the movie capt america toiron man what are you without your suit iron man a genius a billionaire a playboy and  lots of love to and will see the first day first episode of 2,fantasy
i feel this is going to be the summer of adult children because after seeing this movie i felt like a kid all over again great story line great characters excellent actorsif they could only get this right in scary movies i read a review recently that said samuel l jacksons character wasnt good enough i am not sure what they were looking for but he fit the bill for me honestly this is a movie you and your kids will enjoy and you might want to see it 23 time just because it is butt kickin awesomeall of the characters were great but i definitely recommend you watch thor first before going to see because then the story line really engulfs you has you on the edge of your seat the entire time only other hero i was looking for was the gatekeeper from thor one hell of a character in that one so he really would have brought the business in but that just makes you want an even better movie next time,fantasy
 is what happens when people who are best in their class unite  the wittyness of robert downy and the shear and raw strength of hulk keeps you asking for more  other heroes such as hawk and captn america could have been better but still they slip in at the right spot  even if you havent watched any of the previous movies containing these characters  the movie provides enuf mateial to chew for them  even it makes you go home and watch these movies once atleast iron man for sure its only in the big screen that you are able to see the actual might of the tech  this movie is made with  skip the torrents and watch it on the larger curtain  youll never regret it thats for sure all in all a must watch  could have been better if was made in imax format rather than 3d bcuz it has those large screen scenes that look fantabulous in imax  hoping to see the larger avenger group in forthcoming sequels if they overcome the copyright issue with sony ,fantasy
this may include spoilerslets make something clear theres nothing wrong with special effects not every movie can or should be as low key as my dinner with andre sometimes big explosions are necessary to advance the plot the problem is that blockbusters tend to be high on special effects but low on story the though found a way to balance both beautifully into a fun and engaging film im not an expert on the marvel universe so i went into this film with only rudimentary knowledge of the heroes involved i cant vouch for the accuracy of their portrayals by their actors i still found myself interested in them and their stories robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner and scarlett johansson reprise their respective roles and played them perfectly while mark ruffalo appeared as the third man to pay the incredible hulk in a decade and probably the best of the three all six played their parts appropriately well though downey stole the show with his larger than life portrayal of tony stark that may define his already impressive career as an actor every good superhero movie has to have a good antagonist and the delivers with the manipulative quick witted cocky yet insecure loki played by tom hiddleston the tension between him and his adoptive brother thor made for a fascinating and sometimes heart breaking sub plot in the middle of a rock em sock em action movie like this one lokis inferiority complex and obsession with power was a perfect contrast for thors maturity and desire for peace not only in the world but with his brotherthe did have a bit of a predictable story but it worked in this instance sometimes that predictability is comforting and helps one immerse himherself in the universe of the film you find yourself actively rooting for the heroes and scowling whenever the villain appears on the screen that stark contrast between good and evil can inspire groans but if executed properly can reach an innocent juvenile side of us that doesnt need complex antiheroes or thought provoking character studies sometimes we just want to see good triumph over evil against extremely unlikely odds this movie does just that dont be surprised if you catch yourself walking out of the theater feeling like a 10 year old kid wanting nothing more than to be your favorite of the six heroes while this isnt a modern day classic like the dark knight its a solid superhero film that lives up to its immense hypeoh and when you go dont forget to stick around after all the credits are finished youre in for a surprise,fantasy
i was waiting for the ever since i heard that they would make a movie with this theme and scenario having watched all the previous films with the superheroes that supposedly would form the first team thor iron man captain america hulk i have to admit that i was very anxious as some of them didnt quite leave up to my expectations although to be honest my expectations sometimes can be quite highthe movie didnt disappoint me at all the lines and the acting of everyone involved i think were ranging from very good to exceptional the movie doesnt bore you with the background of its characters since you are supposed to be already aware of their past and the combat scenes i think that they had the right amount of humor and action to make them a fans wet dreamtherefore i highly recommend to everyone fan or no fan to watch itand now all we have to wait is prometheus and dark knight rises ,fantasy
as someone who had kind off lost faith in where this marvel superhero series was going ive got to admit to being pleasantly surprised by the i suppose i shouldnt be all the other movies especially the lame captain america main purpose was to lead up too this so off course this was always going to be the biggest event and most well organised flickmovie sees iron man captain america thor and the hulk thrown together too battle the bad guy from thor whos managed to get his hands on the weapon from captain america right  it is a bit hard to follow at first if your not a diehard fan off the previous movies but once it gets going every character is served well and the action is imaginative and nonstopthe is also pretty damn funny robert downey jnr is his usual wise cracking self but unlike in the iron man movies the humour is perfectly balanced with the action thor and captain america dont seem as lame as they were in their own movies and my personal favourite hulk is still the greatest and is played almost better than in previous versions here by mark ruffalothe only minor problem i have with the movie is that everyone seems just as indestructible as each other i mean isnt hulk suppose to be the only unstoppable force seems even scarlett johansson as the powerless black widow is unstoppable still id go as far as saying the is maybe even the best superhero movie ever its refreshing too see as many characters as this thrown together successfully its so much better than the sum off its parts totally entertaining and awesome,fantasy
this film is recommendedlike those silly latenight infomercials found on cable television stations nationwide with their cutrate deals and instant addons used to entice any viewer to immediately buy into their product while supplies last we unassuming consumers are there as gullible pawns bombarded by all the hype and promotion for the first of many summer blockbusters namely marvels the a movie that safeguards its marvel franchise by adding not one not two but six popular superheroes into the mix of action fantasy and adventure the question remains is it worthy of your time and hardearned cash or just another disappointing comeonwell without any warranty or guarantee i can safely state that the exacts its vengeance upon all those other lackluster dimwitted comic book archetypes that sullied the name of its genre in the past with dreck that was recently foisted on the moviegoing public in films like the green lantern watchmen and captain america wellwhamm bam kapow this highly entertaining film knocks it out of the park with one fell swoop of its mighty hammer american shield and its major muscle action this pic uses its well defined pecs again to right that injustice thanks to the superpowers of its director  director joss whedon and industrial light  magic the film is all action sequences strung together to elicit enough excitement for the fanboys and teenage crowd and still amuse the older seta team of super humans mutants and even a demigod have been assembled to save the earth from destruction a simple but overused formula that sets the stage for explosions chases and super effects shield  strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division with an emphasis on the e and not much evidence of the l word  run by nick fury  samuel l jackson  who wears an eyepatch and a scowl so you know hes a serious threat enlists the aid of ironman  robert downey  captain america  chris evans  and the mighty thor  chris hemsworth  also joining the crew for this outing are mark ruffalo as the introspective bruce banner aka the hulk a welcome addition jeremy renner as hawkeye with his neverending illogical supply of arrows and scarlett johansson as black widow a kickbutt inyourface heroine as they fight against the evil loki  tom hiddleston  ready to unleash his lethal ball of gamma rays or more precisely his blue energy cube known as tesseract the mcguffin of the story thats all you really need to know theres not much depth of character dramatic readings or intricate plot in this type of movie genre lets face it its all about the action set pieces the clever oneliners and the cgi that youve come to see and theres plenty of thatfortunately this group of freaks take their loner status personally and whedon wisely deals with their individual uniqueness in clever ways having some of the superheroes relishing their powers while others question their calling these personalities have nothing in common except for wielding their power and zingers at random yet they are forced to unite for the good of mankind and become a team in this super bowl of mayhemthe production values are topnotch and the use of 3d is quite effectively done with its subtle use of foreground middle and background perspectives kudos to cinematographer seamus mcgarvey and the fine art direction by james chinlund the film is also enhanced by alan silvestris musical score that never overpowers its imagery and impressive use of sound editing that layers the lively action on screenthe actors bring much humor and grace to their characters and their quirks especially strong are johansson as the redhaired leatherclad dynamo and ruffalo who underplays his role as the conflicted green menace to maximum effect although i still have a problem with the hulks expandable pants malfunction  there is one unexpected comic scene during the climactic battle that may become a classic cinematic moment  downeys urban egotistical playboy hero and evans cleancut and slightly dopey captain make good contrasting foils in their approach to problemsolving in his underwritten role as thor hemsworth is not given much complexity this time around perhaps most importantly the villain of the story is played by hiddleston who has perfected a smarmy sneer of a smile reminiscent of ledgers riddler without the jungle red lipstick and whiteface makeup he makes a terrific villain which needs to be the case if a film like this is to succeedand succeed it does while it is true that too much of the film is the typical crash and burn found in action films nowadays and much of the clash and combat sequences are of the titanic variety and go on for far too long marvels the is one of the better examples of comic book fantasy films that not only engages but completely satisfies its moviegoing audiences with its excellent visual effects and thrills as a film marvels the is an efficient marvel of filmmaking that lives up to its own hype

the is a fun movie fun to watch with no feeling of shame for liking it the plot itself might not be a masterpiece but the characters are all very well written some even better than in the movies that originally presented them and good actors can do wonders with well written characters the special effects are as good as we recently came to expect them and the pace is just perfect for the film which is much to say for an action film that lasts more than two hours i especially liked the performance of robert downey jr and scarlett johansson and tom hiddleston is also very impressive as the very evil loki but almost every one on screen does a good professional job which has a lot to do with the way the roles were written  i know i said it already i simply think it deserves repeating and just one last remark on whoever complains that the plot doesnt make any sense if you accept super heroes the rest comes with the territory its not less likely than any other comic based film ive seen the only problem begins when the characters come out too cartoonish the acting doesnt have much to cling to and the whole thing falls apart it doesnt happen here,fantasy
this film was under a lot of pressure to deliver after all of the great advertisement and the continuous after credit scenes to all of the marvel films i must say my expectations werent high after iron man 2 and captain america but i must say this film was highly enjoyable and from start to finish it has you grippedit was adventurous it was comical and the story was great all of the actors delivered a great performance especially tom hiddleston mark ruffalo and robert downey jr their perceptions of their characters were great and you couldnt ask for much morethe story itself had so many moments that just kept you in anticipation to see what happens next and this included with the comical moments just made you want morethe only downsides to this film were that some of the characters didnt feel as used as others such as hawkeye and black widow but this is only a minor issue the other problem is that the film had to end i seriously could have kept watching if it went on much longer it was just that goodthis will most certainly be one of the best films this year alongside the dark knight rises and prometheusoverall i give this film an 84 due to its excellent delivery of the story and the acting was spot on i would recommend this film to anyone and i hope everyone enjoyed it as much as i didremember to stay after the credits,fantasy

wow 88 is truly sky high for a an action flick but it deserves ithave seen this movie twiceand it gets better the second time around because you can really enjoy the actionthe best thing of this movie is the way they are able to put such a high degree of a comic book feel to it its almost perfect a major weakness to the movie is the 3d effects and watching it in imax is a major waste of money the movie was turned into imax and added 3d effects to get extra cashbut its truly disappointingso be warnedcant avoid 3d but the imax version should be avoided save the moneyto the characters hawkeye doesnt come out so great lack of arrowsnot a problem in the comics but on screen it felt quite sad also the fight scenesh2h with a bow is kinda forced and not so greatly choreographed maybe an idea to get yuen woo ping next time to choreograph some nice fighting moves for himcant complain about black widow and scarlet johansson she is always a treat to watchbut like hawkeye she doesnt have any superpowers the feeling i have isduring the fight scenesdoes she have any chance at all to me it feels like toddlers fighting along with marines in a real war no chance at alli still dont like thor he is always a favorite in the comicsbut on screen he is just not so impressive but most of the characters are great iron man and rdjr are great as usual iron man is much much better on screen than in the comics always felt he was kinda boring on paperbut rdjr has build such a character around him incredibletruly masterful how he has able to interpret this character and build him up and the humor he has instilled in ironman and the other movies are i think a great influence in this movie tooprobably the best character here is the hulk sure ruffalo doesnt disappoint as banner but lets face itwho cares its about the hulk and this time he has been portrayed perfectly there are two hulk charactersthe brilliant scientist and mindless monster version this version has been on big and small screens most of the time and is getting really boring and we have seen all the different stories of this than banner is important in we see the second versionhulk the super hero and i love this version matter of factto me hulk had some of the best scenes of the moviecaptain america to me has the most depth remember the standalone captain america movie is about the beginning of caps story in this movie we see how he struggles adjusting to the new world and age its just a small bitbut its so interesting evans does a great job so stiff and to good to be true but thats cap america hope they will make a new movie frankly the cap america story is getting better the older it gets because the differences are getting bigger and bigger he is part of the 1940s generation part of the one in a life time generation that made a country great and set the stage for us dominance when he wakes upits a different usa we might even saya usa thats in its decline as a world power anyway its a great movie and i think deserves its high marks give him a 9 out of 103d is weak and imax a waste of money,fantasy
when i was 10 years old my brother and i discovered the world of comic books  adamantium claws mutant chromosomes capes tights unique abilities that we imagined what we would do if only we possessed them how great it would be if we didnt have to visualize these heroes in our minds but watch them in a liveaction moviewith this movie the dreams of geeks and nerds have been fulfilled in some sick and twisted yet wonderful manner like the wet fantasies of normal people but magnified by the nth power it feels almost wrong to see iron man argue with captain america each capturing the essence of who they are supposed to be in the flesh how wonderful it isonce you get past the awesome visual reality that is the assembled its a delightful pleasure that the director or the screenwriters implemented several laugh out loud moments that were seamlessly woven into the flow of this movie the hulk in particular provides at least a couple of comic moments that had everyone in the theater roaring its not that we dont take this stuff seriously  we really do its great entertainment and the box office results prove this yet lest we forget there is a bit of ridiculousness in this mish mash of a giant green monster a man in red and blue tights a modernday bow and arrow archer and so forth  and why confine entertainment to being onedimensional spectacle and visual effects when you can select and choose from a true arsenal of gifts,fantasy
this was quite literally a perfect movie it combined humor action great acting great orchestra amazing vfx and robert downey jr 1010 without a doubti think that the best character in the movie was hulk although my favorite was iron man he really tied the movie together hulks personality shined during the end fight it showed that he wasnt always angry and could hold the great place in history he deservesthe most fascinating hero imo is haulkeye i really think that we should see maybe a training session in 2 where he shows off his talents all in all is a fantastic movie go see it trust me you wont regret it,fantasy
im glad to see the response to marvels the damn that uma thurman movie for making me have to print the full title has been very very positive if there was ever a case for expectations being unreasonable then this was it also we always get some anal fans that are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions either stayed very close to its root origins or people are judging it as the fine film it turned out to be its both to be honest and it seems most enjoyed it as much as i did anyone worried that joss whedon would make something this epic look like tv work needs worry no more visually it is a sight to behold and as epic as it deserves to be i dont remember when i enjoyed a film this much and i really loved a lot of 2011s offerings this movie just hits the highest level possible for me it works on all of its own terms theres no weighted enjoyment or cinematic slumming involved in enjoying it it really is a smart action film and the cast really delivered as expected with this exceptional cast involved how could it not whedon knew who his aces were and how to play them downey and jackson are classic thats not to say every major character didnt shine at one point its just that when the beats mattered the big guns when front and center i also loved what whedon did with loki and how much of a home run tom hiddleston hit truly a remarkable movie treat and im glad to see that the majority of film fans agree with me the movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions best of all you leave the theater smiling and completely wanting more,fantasy
first off the hulk in the incredible hulk httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0800080 was animated more realistic and was more aesthetically pleasing second i heard somebody in the movie theater say thor looks like he came out of rehab ouch you have to agree after watching the movie thor httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0800369 he lost a lot of muscle looking more like a guy in a movie suit acting like thor and looking less like a god of thunder actor chris hemsworth must have been juggling the filming of the with the cabin in the woods effectively eating away at the hard work put into building his physique lets hope chris hemsworth gets a free pass to rebuild his thor muscles and please dont forget the legs as a life action rendition of super hero lore is definitely enhanced by them it is realistic fantasy after all may as well go for gold same goes for captain america who is just too skinny to be believablecan it be better of course would i watch this movie again yes already watched it three times would i recommend this movie to those unfamiliar with the comic book yes just dont think about anything but being entertained for 25 hours,fantasy
the is one of the nice action packed movie released recently the movie lived up to the expectation with all the special effectsanother noticeable factor of the movie is the nice humor that they have bought with it robert downey jr did an amazing work as the famous iron man his performance as usual is stand out and his dialogues are always humoroushulk did a great job with his unbeatable strength no one will ever mess with the other one in him he proved that he can even mess with a godthor and his adopted brother played the key roles for sure but some how i felt they didnt utilize jeremy renner to his full extendall in all the movie is a must watch to all the action lovershttpatomviewscom,fantasy
when i went to see this movie i believed the hype and was very anxious to see it i was well prepared i had seen all the relevant marvel movies leading to this initiative after seeing this movie i left the cinema that cold rainy night feeling overwhelmly satisfied rarely you find a gem of a film in life and this has to be one of them marvels best live action movie since xmen 2 i was gripped to my seat and didnt even notice the 2 hours slip by i didnt even stay for the end credits where im told a small clip is played which will certainly mean a sequel i didnt stay for the end credits because i spontaneously rushed to see this film alone for the first time in my life dont laugh i only regret that i couldnt share this extravaganza with someone other then the strangers with me in the cinemagreat storyline great special effects great action some comedy and soul this film has it all and its for everyone just dont see how they can make the sequel better than this but will be interested to see what else stan lee has got under his sleeves 1010,fantasy
as i settled in for marvels the to cite its full title my mind began to drift back a few years all the way back to another marvel action team the xmen i complained then that the problem of multiple superheroes on the screen at the same time is a problem of crowd control how do you give equal screen time to a handful of characters with special abilities and have them be more than just cardboard characters with colorful powers the xmen series never straightened out this problem but with marvels the this is not an issueit was a smart plan for marvel studios to build the characters one at a time giving each superhero their own movie in an effort to introduce them in preparation for their assembly here as a leadin we got iron man 2008 the incredible hulk 2008 iron man 2 2010 and last summers thor and captain america the first avenger  next up is nick fury with that by the time we get to marvels the most of the heavy lifting in the introduction department is already done for us that frees up the plot to get past the introductions and get on with the action although the movie does open with the required scenes in which the team members have to be brought into the fold one by onethe are more interesting to me than the xmen because they come from different places thor chris hemsworth is norse god from another galaxy captain america chris evans is a geneticallyaltered army strongman from the 1940s hulk mark ruffalo is a green muscle mass hiding out in india under the passive alter ego of bruce banner and iron man robert downey jr is the billionaire metallurgist whose headquarters overlook the chrysler building in new york plus theres an archer called hawkeye jeremy renner and a token female russianborn woman named black widow scarlett johansson who i think is good with martial arts for whatever reason these last two didnt get a movie of their own but stay tunedthe like the xmen are also led by a secretive baldheaded authority figure with a handicap he is nick fury samuel l jackson who runs a shadow organization called shield whose function is to stop super villains from    well doing supervillainy i suppose the task here is to get back an object called the tesseract an object that  if i understood it correctly  acts as a power source to open a portal to another galaxy thats bad news for our planet because it means that the norse god loki tom hiddleston thors adopted halfbrother can make his way into our realm and rule the world with his powerful superarmy it also means that he can use it to take control of the minds of certain shield personnel lokis first stop to announce his intentions to rule the world germany maybe he hasnt heard but thats probably not a wise place to startthe personalities are known to us but what is refreshing is that they are not known to one another in this movie many are meeting each other for the first time and no one knows who can be trusted thats especially true with a tense relationship between iron man and thor since he has fallen out of the heavens just like the evil loki can he be trusted another issue of tension comes with the addition of bruce banner everyone knows that he has a serious anger management problem and the movie deals nicely with everyones apprehension that hulks destructive nature could be a potential problemthe most engaging character in the film for me is bruce banner played this time by mark ruffalo who manages to pull off the best performance out of the past three actors who have occupied the role ruffalo plays banner as a mildmannered soul who is very aware that he has to keep his mood in check he does something interesting he quiets his voice to a calm mellow deliberate tone that lets you know that he is aware of the destructive power of what he calls the other guy i liked his rendition of bruce banner although i think the screenwriter missed a perfect opportunity to show bruce living a feng shui lifestyle with meditations and aroma therapy candles in an effort to keep his mood in check maybe with the mantra keep calm and carry on that might have been perfecti liked the character touches in marvels the i liked the dialogue which is written at a smart snappy level by writerdirector joss whedon he has a way with dialogue that makes even the most mundane of action scenes come alive he is the man behind buffy the vampire slayer firefly toy story and a brilliant horrorcomedy the cabin in the woods still in theatersi just wish that he could have avoided the trash and bash of the third act hes a smart writer but the movie goes into the same exact scenario of tearing up the streets and trashing buildings that weve seen a million times it would have been see the same inventive brilliance as the last act of the cabin in the woods and created something that would really take the movie into the realm of something special his is best in smaller perfect moments and little flashes of smart dialogue when you stand back and look at the plot as a whole you see that it really doesnt add up to much more than just a bunch of superheroes trying to keep a meany from taking over the world his movie as it stands exists somewhere between the hohum of the xmen and the brilliant extravaganza of the dark knight it isnt a perfect film but i enjoyed it probably more than i expected,fantasy
i am in awe marvel and paramounts slow but purposeful journey over the last few summers has paid off as i could never imagine it worked folks it worked the film is not necessarily a thoughtprovoking acadey award winning film but is is entertainment of the highest order with some wonderfully funny moments and believe it or not strong character development for the entire castjoss whedon deserves the vast amount of credit he reminds me of a young steven spielberg around the time of jaws and close encounter young successful enjoying his work and completely ignored by his elderly and jealous peersi suspect and hope the sequel will delve a little deeper into drama and the psyche of each character this film is a great example of how to properly start an ongoing and compelling film series,fantasy
i am a relatively new convert to the world of marvel i did not grow up reading comic books or knowing anytnig about these iconic characters my experience with marvel began in 2008 when i first saw iron man in theaters and fell in love with it i was blown away by the level of storytelling and especially by robert downey jrs phenomenal performance as tony stark that movie shaped my idea of what storytelling and what movies could be i kind of put that movie in the back of my mind for two years but when iron man 2 released in 2010 i truly began my love of superhero movies over the next two years i immersed myself in the marvel universe i have been blown away by iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger all of those movies have been fantastic as stand alone movies but joss wheadon the man who gave us the tv adaptation of buffy the vanpire slayer firefly and its followup sernity somehow finds a way to bring all these standalone characters and the elements of the past movies in the marvel universe and combines them perfectly together to make something wholly original intelligent and extremely breathtakingafter loki tom hiddelston comes to earth from the otherworldly kingdom of asguard and decides that these new people and this new planet nick fury samuel l jackson the leader of a government agency called shield is forced to bring together the worlds most powerful superheros tony starkiron man robert downey jr steve rogerscaptain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth and dr bruce bannerthe incredible hulk mark ruffalo together in order to combat his menace along with shield agents natasah romanovblack widow scarlett johannsen and clint bartonhawkeye jermey renner the heroes must battle lokis armywhat makes this movie great is the fact that the dont get along well at all when they first meet captain america and iron man take an immediate dislike to one another and no one seems to like thor as he disagrees with cap and iron man on just about everything these confrontations make for some of the funniest scenes in the movie this is a deeper more philosophical and mature super hero movie while still being an entertaining fun popcorn movie while still being the best superrhero movie of all time this is more than just an actionadventurepopcorn movie this is every sense of the term a masterpiece of filmmaking i would say that this movie is worth seeing if youve seen any of the other marbel films or even if youve never seen the movies wheadon does a damn good job filling in all the blanks of the past movies perfectly for those who havent seen them either way see this movie see it in 3d if possible,fantasy
so i just got back from seeing marvels the excuse me while i reattach my face to my skullill admit that when i first heard that they were going to put all of these big egos in one big movie i was expecting a cinematic disaster of epic proportions something as awful as the transformers films something that was nothing more than badasses on parade so initially i was completely uninterested then i heard joss whedon was involved i said to myself well itll at least be decent and decided to go see it boy am i ever glad i did it is badasses on parade but it goes far far beyond thatlet me get it out of the way right now i dont know a damned thing about comic books luckily familiarity with the original comics is not necessary you can get by with just seeing the prequel films i saw and enjoyed iron man and thor snored my way through the incredible hulk and skipped captain america the first avenger i did not have any trouble following what was going on in so if you need some setup iron man and thor are the only ones that you really need to see the other two are pretty much optionali didnt give a crap about hulk or cap when i went into this movie and i walked out actually liking both of them i thought edward nortons absence would leave a gaping hole i thought wrong mark ruffalo does a fine job also chris evans is charming as hell charming enough that i was totally sold on cap about halfway through the film in fact i like him so much that i may just go back and watch captain america after alllets talk more about actors specifically lets talk about tom hiddleston who plays loki god of mischief in this film and in thor he is one of my favorite things about this movie and was most definitely my favorite thing about thor i was really worried when i learned that he was going to be the main villain i was having visions of him growing a really big mustache so he could stand around and twirl it while laughing maniacally and tying natalie portman to some railroad tracks thankfully that is not the case at all both the script and hiddlestons acting make loki one of the best movie villains i have ever seen in my life and ive seen a lot of movie villains hes so good that i was almost rooting for him okay maybe its partly because i also find tom hiddleston strangely attractive his devilish grin chills me to the bone and gets my heart racing all at the same time none of you need to inform me that im a weirdo im fully aware of it now lets talk about action i am not exaggerating when i say that this is one of the best damn action movies i have ever seen speaking strictly about asskicking fight sequences and citysmashing spectacle this is right up there with movies like the matrix and the lord of the rings trilogy every hero and villain gets their due they all get to show off their strong points therefore they all shine the action is wellchoreographed and nicely shot no shakycam to be found here thank god furthermore we care about the action because we like and care about the people involved filmmakers take note this is how you make an action filmanother thing thats great about this movie is the script not only did joss whedon direct he also penned the screenplay anyone whos familiar with his work knows hes the master of witty dialogue and has excellent comedic timing and hes in top form here in other words this movie is funny really funny theres plenty of the razorsharp wit weve come to expect from tony stark played to perfection by robert downey jr but theres also physical comedy delivered bywell ill try not to spoil it for you youll know it when you see itlets talk some more about the script the film clocks in at around 2  hours but you wont feel it at all unless you drank too much soda theres a place for everything and everything is in its place theres nothing extraneous and theres nothing missing it establishes the group dynamic and establishes the plot and then everything pays off in a big big way the plot is nothing revolutionary but its perfectly serviceable and its really the characters who should be the main focus here in the first placeanyway to sum it up this movie delivers on just about every level if you just want to munch some popcorn and watch some awesome action then this movie will not disappoint you seriously i cant say enough good things about the action sequences if you want a good laugh forget the comedy films and just watch this if you like hot guys in tight costumes there are plenty of them here if you want to see acting that ranges from good to excellent here it is if you want characters you can feel something for well it has that too sounds too good to be true right im probably among the most skeptical moviegoers in these united states but this movie made a believer out of meive been trying to find a fault in the but there are none that present themselves upon first viewing i guess ill just have to watch it a couple more times well darn sarcasm aside if i had the 10 extra bucks id go see it again right this minute,fantasy
i am sorry to say that is not good movies its really great movie i was lucky to watch this movie  all actor work great and have many comedy sense superb action  ive never read comic books this is a comic book movie it was made for hardcore fans of comics and i appreciate the care joss whedon gives to this movie it was very entertaining to see tony stark iron man thor dr bruce banner hulk steve rogers captain america natasha romanoff black widow clint barton hawkeye agent maria hill agent phil coulson and director nick fury all interact with one another i am big ban of marvel movies for me its great movie dont miss it go and watch,fantasy
im not sure if the is the best superhero movie ever but i cant think of one that tops it big kudos to director joss whedon screenplay zak penn script and the other scribes for writing such an intelligent moviethis film is much more than bad guy wants to beat the good guys and rule the world the movie expertly weaves together plot elements of recent marvel movies thor captain america and iron man 2 i enjoyed how each of the had scenes that enhanced their characterizations i appreciated how the tesseractcosmic cube figured into different peoples motivations for securing it so as to do evil or do good and not everyone agrees about which is whichthe dialogue in the is excellent robert downey jr tony starkiron man and tom hiddleston loki are especially good at delivering their linesand whats a superhero movie without punches and explosions the fight sequences are great and the special effects are fantastic congrats to the several hundred artists who made cities landscapes alien hordes and the shield helicarrier look so realistici will be seeing the again at a theater soon and im already looking forward to marvel studios making 2 you dont have to be a genius like tony stark to know thats going to happen,fantasy
one word excellent ive collected comic books on and off for many years including the this movie nailed the feel of the best of them the characters were great and true to formstark as the arrogant genius cap as the straightlaced leader thor as the mythical demigod banner as the tortured scientist with a beast inside him black widow as the super spy martial artist with a dark past and hawkeye as the super marksman the great thing about this film is how different they are and how they play off each other but come together for the common good to defeat loki and save the world loki by the way was outstanding as the merciless villain i love the way that the movie felt like a sequel to each of the marvel films that came before it no ensemble superhero movie has been done betterxmen 1 and 2 were great but essentially centered on wolverine as he interacted with the team this one centers on no less than 6 characters and they all get pretty equal billing this is a must see and gift to comic and action fans alike,fantasy
the became a big success at the box office but in reality its not that great its a fine film with a lot of action in the end however its a passable hollywood product the plot is something that only a comic book reader will enjoy or fully understand and its there only to show several different and iconic superheroes working together the actors do a fine job but for me there were no standout performances perhaps the only one who stood out was chris evans as captain america because he was righteous oldfashioned and he wasnt sarcastic and this brings me to the script by joss whedon which is quite poor i guess it wasnt easy to write a good screenplay in which each superhero has to seem relevant this is the biggest reason why the script fails to surprise for example robert downey jr is his usual self as iron man but theres nothing that stands out in his performance he had a lot more to work with in iron man 2008 and there was plenty more drama there too the script is rather predictable and the characters dont come off well because they have nothing important to say the main villain loki is also a letdown i like tom hiddleston but his character has little to do except walk talk and look menacing add to this a horde of enemies about whom we know almost nothing and we have one rather boring second half of the film the heroes fight the enemies like theyre shooting cans at target practice they employ their skills and its all quite dull because there are too many weak and faceless enemies the final battle reminded me a lot of transformers 2007 joss whedon does a good job as director but the is still a by the numbers action summer blockbuster yes the special effects are impressive in places other than that theres nothing here to get excited about films like iron man 2008 thor 2011 and the incredible hulk 2008 had more to like than this film the addition of silly and predictable humor only makes the film seem more forgettable the entertains during most of its running time but theres nothing here to take to heart,fantasy
the was a undeniably a movie that was more than what we had ever hoped for the characters and the way all of them came together from their previous solo moves was exceptional however as far as the cast goes i feel that some of them dominated over the others perhaps because of the success of their solo manifestations for those of u who have had a previous knowledge about the plot would know that captain america was their allinall leader however he never got the recognition or position that he deserved like i said earlier this should be because of the fact that out the entire lot iron man was the biggest hit hollywood had got but this undeniably changed the entire outlook of the team although towards the end of the movie he gave some orders to the rest of his team it still does not entirely prove the leadership of captain america the hulk who smashed his way into the hollywood scene with a second comeback film also shared the lime light with his hilarious uncontrollable self and his total disregard to anyone or anything that stood in his way of doing business,fantasy
for four years marvel fans all over the world has been anticipating for one of the biggest superhero mashups in motion picture history we have been promised this movie for so long that now one of the biggest motion picture phenomenons has finally hit theaters big superhero names such as iron man the hulk thor and captain america has finally recruited together and theyre off to save the world once again in an unstoppable group wow this is easily the best movie of the year so far i can talk for hours and hours about how excellent this movie is first of all directorcowriter joss whedon is probably one of the best storytellers to know how to make a movie and its characters realistic and relevant take joss whedons previous film the cabin in the woods for example which does a perfect job of making the story look realistic and the characters look totally relevant thats the moviemaking magic that joss whedon adds in the filled with comical gags this movie also feels like a 2hour action comedy film the jokes are timed precisely and the humor is downright believable robert downey jr is still wonderful for his performance as tony stark aka iron man chris hemsworth is brilliant as thor mark ruffalo delivers one of the best portrayals of bruce banner aka the hulk ever seen on screen and chris evan delivers a more better performance as captain america we also have a supporting cast that reprises their roles from previous marvel movies such as scarlett johansson dropdead gorgeous as black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye samuel l jackson as nick fury tom hiddleston as the villainous loki clark gregg as phil coulson stellan skarsgard as erik selvig and gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts its such a wonderful treat to watch all these marvel characters that we all know and love and place them all into one movie the 3d only works a few times but the breathtaking action scenes are just downright breathtaking exhilarating exciting and mostly entertaining the action scenes are probably some of the best action scenes ever put to film youll be on the edge of your seat wanting for more the comedy is just hilariously relevant the action is downright entertaining and the characters are written in such a realistic way i sat in the movie theater with the 3d glasses and the entire auditorium was fully packed with tons of super fans everyone was laughing applauding and cheering during the entire 2hour 22minute movie i can easily see why this is a nonstop exciting cinematic phenomenon that perfectly knows how to do one thing and one thing only give the fans what they want the is a hilarious exciting breathtaking and nonstop fun motion picture that deserves the attention given from fans all over the world this is also one of the best movies of the year the in my review an astonishing and breathtaking motion picture an excellent extravaganza of cinematic proportions,fantasy
i really loved the it was the best marvel movie that ive seen in years and ive seen a lot of them and it was funny now usually superhero movies arent as funny as other movies they are usually very dramatic and normally one of the main characters in the movie die well this movie has a little bit of both its very funny and a main character did indeed die now i wont give away who dies but will say that it wont be a surprise when you see it the movie had great action scenes their was a great fight between iron man and thor and captain america and an absolutely awesome fight scene with thor facing off with the hulk they tore up shield fighting each other i mean you will go crazy when you see it loki was also very evil his intentions are to take over the world and you want him to lose so bad and he does in the end but you will definitely see and admire the evil in him and you will not be disappointed at all particularly with the scene where the black widow is talking to loki while he is in the cell inside shield the evilness in his voice will scare you to your core he also does a good job controlling his alien army who are the ultimate adversaries for the and the ultimate threat to the entire planet but anyway the movie was great the heroes each played their part iron man tony stark was a great leader and made the ultimate sacrifice at the end of the film captain america also had great leadership qualities and has adjusted to the new world he is in quite well and thor helps with his lightning power and strength without which the never would have survived he knew who the aliens were and that he had to stop his brother loki at all costs the hulk was great too and did a lot of hulk smashing and smashed a few of the alien ships which was very helpful indeed all and all the cast was perfect and joss whedon crafted an amazing film that will be enjoyed by geeks everywhere for years to come,fantasy
finally after 5 years of waiting the have finally assembled that means no more teasing from that bold black guy with an eye patch and having to wait through the end credits but more importantly we get see earths mightiest heroes join forces for the first time should you and your friends assemble to the cinema to see it the plot is simple and straightforward which involves loki the god of mischief entering earth through a portal using the tesseract which is a glowing cube of doom along with lokis glowing staff of doom he possesses the minds of clint barton and dr erik selvis in response to this takeover nick fury decides to reinstate the initiative to recruit steve rogerscaptain america chris evans bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo and my favourite of the bunch tony starkiron man robert downey jr who we are all reintroduced to before the team finally mobilizes everyone is present and correct accept for spiderman aunt may was ill at the time you see the story is as silly as it sounds with the villains diabolical plan but director joss whedon managers to pull it off with the storys memorable and iconic characters rubbing shoulders the is also about the clash of egos which must be overcome if they want to succeed against loki whedon is self aware of how silly a team of colourful superheroes coming from vastly different backgrounds coming together really is with these characters mocking and taunting ways each other in playful and witty ways being the highlight of the movie offering some hilarious moments such as tonys confrontation with thor and steve rogers having to adjust to modern day tech no babble as good as the script writing is there are moments where the dialogue feels over the top such as the chitauris conversations with loki there are also moments which are needed to be taken more seriously that werent and mixed both tragedy and comedy what really makes the great was the banter which ensued by putting these characters together banner and stark get along well because of their intellect however stark is put off by rogers who he thinks as a lab experiment watching these personalities collide is almost like watching a reality tv show this makes the ark the characters go through more prevailing as they gradually come to accept the responsibility of being a team and finding common ground with their vendetta against loki this brings us to our villain loki tom hiddleston who i thought would be a generic villain took me by surprise i was expecting an over the top clichd performance just like the loud and lacklustre red skull from captain america but i was wrong loki has versatility and depth being the god of mischief he has a sense of humour to go along with his slimy and crafty attitude his motivation maybe mad but he gets it across with such conviction making this the best on screen villain since heath ledgers joker from the dark knight the action scenes are brilliantly shot and handled the final action scene is just the right length however there is little suspense with our heroes being immune to every knock explosion and everything else that is thrown at them however the spectacle is amazing to behold the action and the special effects also have substance behind them giving it more significance thanks to the brilliant ensemble cast of likable personalities who doesnt like the fact of the ego manic tony stark taking on a massive metal space worm michael bay will probably be in a huff that joss whedon can destroy new york better then chicago the camera work is also very creative with a scene panning across everyone bickering but as they bicker the camera shows lokis staff activating behind them i dont know how marvel has done it but the lives up to the hype it redefines the fun and frantic comic book movie which proves you dont have to have a superhero movie be dark and brooding for it to be well received critically it definitely is a breath of fresh air for a summer blockbuster to have substance behind its crazy style the maybe silly and predictable but silly and predictable can be good sometimes thanks to its likable characters and entertaining story to create a thrilling experience 810 memorable moments its hard to pick just one so i will pick one for each of my favourite captain americataking control and leading the team in the final battle despite being dressed up like a blueberry thor face off with iron man in the woods iron manconfronting loki in stark tower the hulkgiving loki the old fashioned comic book thwack and thwomp,fantasy
what was that  i went to this movie last night with high hopes and great expectations  and i was right  in fact this movie exceeds all expectations  i will not spoil anything here  and i really dont know where to start  marvel in its best suite ever  finally they did it  they gathered them in one freaking movie  the  i used to watch each one of them alone  or perhaps some of them together in the animated movies   but to watch this movie with this cast  am still impressed  never thought they would make this movie like that way  they made it for the ages i guess  the cast was perfect and everyone knew what he will do and knew his rule  there were some funny moments in the movie which everyone in the theater was laughing loudly at  action scenes were perfectly made  top notch in fact  every single shot in the movie counts  every single shot was perfectly made  i really loved the assembly of the cast together  robert downy jr still has it  the whole cast is perfect  watch this movie  you will be satisfied  i gave it 9 out of 10 watch and feel free to watch again and again  you will love it,fantasy
this is a basic comic book film handled with style and finesse in the hands of joss whedon ive always been a fan of his and im glad to see he finally got his chance to shine on the premise of the film is loki brother of thor steals the tesseract from last summers captain america and uses it to unleash his own army upon the world and claim it as his kingdom however this is the weakest point in the film in reaction to these events nick fury calls upon his most wonderful of agents and assembles them somewhat to deal with this here is where joss whedon shines he is a man who knows characters and has a skill for witty and wellplaced dialog but also of great vision he understands the ego of all those involved and plays them off of one another including a fantastic scene of iron man and thor going toe to toe for the sole sake of their arrogance captain america stands as the voice of reason but his naivety is blatant his was a simpler time black widow stands in the background as a seminal character but obviously one unused to the limelight hulk played perfectly by mark ruffalo is the humble doctor always subdued for the sake of safety these are people who are used to having the spotlight their own and so they must learn to play well with others but it isnt until the death of phil coulson do they realize the necessity to their alliance which joss whedon displays masterfully in a continuous shot of the group fighting lokis army in manhattan this is not a compelling film but it respects its characters and uses their own energy to drive the plot in a fun and controlled manner its a spectacle to see and the dawn of the superhero epictldr its seven samurai with superheroes go watch it,fantasy
guaranteed to be one of the biggest films of the year is the going to be one of the best well no probably not but with the biggest opening weekend in north american history i am sure no one caresafter years of marvel entries introducing us to the upgraded versions of the likes of iron man thor captain america and in an unfortunate turn the hulk it was all culminating to this thewhere all these guys come together along with nick fury black widow and hawkeye whowith such a long wait was the anticipation worth it well surei think so not being a huge comic geek i thought the film was thoroughly entertaining it was fastpaced actionpacked and the writing was good punchy and terribly funny to be honest there could not have been a better choice of film to officially kickoff the 2012 mindless blockbuster season but is the film itself perfect no far from it there are lulls in the action that could have been slightly edited there are jumps in the story that may not be noticed by a fan of the comics that are in the know but leave nonfans scratching their heads a little and most importantly there are scenes where the special effects are ack off and the use of cgi is really noticeable really noticeable in a film like the and their 220 million budget the effects should be absolutely flawless and the end result here is far from the truthand the hulk being 100 cgi is only part of the problemwith a film of this calibre the one thing that should be absolutely perfect is the special effectsso yes robert downey jr does as good a job as ever chris hemsworth and chris evans are just as expected although we were robbed of at least one shirtless scene each jackson is slightly less intimidating than fury actually should be scarlett johansson is pretty jeremy renner was alright as whoever hawkeye is while mark ruffalo was surprisingly great as dr banner really noteworthy himyms cobie smulders and the return of clark gregg as phil coulsonand yes joss whedon was certainly the man to helm this film and there is no doubt that i will be first in line for the two eventual sequelsbut no the film is not perfect if i had a word of advice for the next instalment the cgi should be flawless and if youre going to release it in 3d make the 3d pop or dont bother doing it at allbut again yes overall the kick starts the summer in grand style but there is no doubt that i am still looking more forward to prometheus and dark knight rises both of which i have a feeling will be much higher quality films but neither will be nearly this much fun,fantasy
this movie rocked on so many levels it is hard to know where to begin from story to cinematography to perfect use of cgi to humour to music to stuff blowin up real good proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that hollywood has not forgotten how to make an entertaining movie as a lifelong hulk fan i was blown away by ruffalos depiction of bruce banner and his big green friend was entirely awesome although hulkbanner was clearly my favourite not a single character in this movie felt wasted underused or overdone they meshed seamlessly for the tasks at hand after being well introduced to marvel newcomers over the first 50 minutes or soabsolutely must see cinema on the big screen movies like this were why we invented popcorn and imax not only is it the best superhero movie of all timeit is one of the greatest movies of any genre ever made,fantasy
the was a delight to watch almost two and a half hours of comiclike action with nick fury managing to assemble earths super humans and fight against thors little brother who found his way back from the void loki is angry and desperate for some attention he almost got me to kneel tony starkiron man robert downey jr is arrogantly gorgeous and steve rogerscaptain america chris evans is the retro patriotic avenger while theres an intense lovehate relationship between them that really keeps you wondering what the hell is going on with these two since ive started like this it doesnt look hard to pair them heroes upnaturally natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson and clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner come next this combination brings up the special human skills of the characters they are the martial arts tactics and weapons specialists and keep more of a supporting role in the film filling up well enough the parts where theres no cgi actioni must say that mark ruffalo bruce bannerhulk was my favorite because i could not imagine how these anger management issues could ever be tamed bruce banners zen attitude made the whole hulk transformation even more exciting and controversial on the other hand thor chris hemsworth such a verbal relief to begin with cause hes just thor the deity and oh isnt he a challenge for the hulk hes practically one of the few outofthisrealm entities who can get slightly close to his powerful energylast but not least loki tom hiddleston thors misunderstood and troubled brother who needs to get his revenge by any means necessary with the help of his evil army youll admit it yourself that he does try hard without always counting the consequences hed be perfect for a psychiatric study shields agents are rounding up the human coordination team with nick fury samuel l jackson being the head of this operation and the only character ones probably gotten used to see in the postcredit scenes of the iron man thor and captain america films as well as agent phil coulson clark gregg youll also get the chance to see cobie smulders agent maria hill also known as robin in how i met your mother tv series making her hollywood outbreakthis film consists of a cluster of actors all getting their respectable time to shine as heroes in stan lees comic masterpieceso heres the thing if youve never seen any of marvels movies make sure you do before you move on to the itll be easier to understand each character their background motives and nemeses make sure to wait for the credits to endif you have seen allmost of them or have read the comics theres no doubt you wont like this one the action is overwhelming theres no need to focus too much on performances and dont forget to wait for the credits to end,fantasy
loved every minute of it how could you not when it has the genius joss whedon behind it would love to see him continue with some other marvel hero movies he is a great story teller and there was no dull moments at all loved the humor in it and all characters bounced off each other extremely well they were all equal parts instead of having a main character and the others as supportingwill definitely be buying another ticket to see it next weekend againmark ruffalos hulk was the best i have seen sorry eric bana and edward nortoncannot wait for ironman 3 and then 2,fantasy
joss whedon finally gets an enormous budget to play with as he cowrites and directs this slab of super powered fun highly watchable from the first scene to the inevitable easter egg whedon made the crucial decision to please the fans at no point during the mammoth 142 minutes play time does it feel unnecessarily dragged out robert downey jr again excels as tony starkiron man however the other cast members deserve a lot of credit for not letting his performance overshadow theirs mark ruffalo is near perfect as bruce bannerthe incredible hulk taking the role from ed norton who played the less than jolly green giant in his last big screen outing as a friend said at last they got hulk right indeed the hulk provides two moments of pure comedy without insulting his mythos a hurdle lots of comic hero adaptations fail to clear cgi is used to enhance rather than substitute for plot something other blockbusters should take note of people unfamiliar with the marvel characters could be confused as to whos who and why but im sure after a little bit theyll be able to sit back and enjoy there is a glaring continuity error though in some scenes the arc reactor in starks chest can clearly be seen glowing beneath his tshirt as it should be because if it wasnt glowing hed be dead then in other scenes whilst starks in civvies no arc reactor can be seen in a film of this magnitude and budget this seems quite negligent assemble will be the movie to beat of 2012 in terms of sheer entertainment we saw it in imax which unlike normal 3d is worth paying for if you love super heroes youll love this movie,fantasy
i generally am not particularly eager to see movies with all that hype around them it often means little more than clever marketing the proved me wrong what is good about this film is that it takes all your mind and all your guts during 230h clever full of action suspense and humourthe special effects were just incredibly effective the way the story develops from the what do we do question to nick fury with the title then appearing to the hidden genuine end of the movie the action does stop only for the viewer to appreciate the characters mindset actors did a good job and understand whats coming next i liked the space given to the female characters mostly black widow to actually portray rich smart and strong individuals neither oversexualised of course its comic inspired so the body is there but there is no direct reliance on her appearance per se to win neither victimised i actually liked the fact that it is black widow who closes the passage few mistakes for me not enough importance was given to thor captain america did look a little bit overwhelmed by his team mates that great weapon phil talked about before using it against loki did not do anything at all i expected him to be wounded the glass cage falling with thor didnt do it for me when you can take the full strength of iron man you can take a fall hes a god tooof course i loved the credits ending scene even if half the crowd missed it it 810,fantasy
the is the story of some of marvels well known super heroes that band together in a joint effort to save the world we know from men in black that the world is always in need of saving so i will take a term from that film and say that this is the best of the best of the best this film has some first rate spectacular out of this world and any other term that i can think of to convey how good the special effects the performances the casting the direction and everything else in it is i did see it in 3d which was totally worth the added premium if i were wearing a hat id give joss whedon director writer a hats off for delivering this action packed extravaganza the story has very clever dialog in that the characters are able to convey exactly what the audience needs to know without it seeming as though we are auditing a super hero 101 lecture although this is what i will call a compilation sequel it was fresh and original and could have easily stood on its own had we not been given all of the prior introduction movies not that im complaining about any of them iron man tony stark robert downey jr was successfully arrogant and enduring at the same time his and hulk bruce banners mark ruffalo intellectual bonding was intriguing enough that im hoping for an iron man featuring hulk follow up film the thor chris hemsworth and loki tom hiddleston sibling rivalry could render countless sequels and was front and center in this story but i will expect to see heimdall idris elba in any subsequent stories or no deal my only issue with the set up films is that there was only the small side story featuring black widow scarlett johansson in iron man i kept hearing james brown in my head singing this is a mans world but from where i sat it wouldnt be nothing without a woman or a hulk i mean a girl natasha romanoff held her own in this boys fight club and riding on the success of this film could easily carry a black widow film i know i know historically the female super hero lead doesnt fare well at the box office but i blame the vehicle not the passenger ever since the incredibles i have these smiling moments when the bad guys start monologuing hulk has the best response to it ive seen to this day i give this film a hulking green light,fantasy
if somebody were to tell you that theres a film featuring a man in a metal suit a guy who wears the american flag a demigod and a green monster wouldnt it strike you as silly oh and it gets even better there is a man with an eyepatch a guy with a bow and arrow and a flying fortresswell with all that put together it still is one of the best superhero films i have seen when i found out that joss whedon the man who made buffy the vampire slayer was set to direct i knew the film was in good hands it was unbelievable how he managed to regulate this ensemble cast i felt like nobody was cut short of screen time the plot was actually pretty solid the characters had weight and the action didnt sacrifice much of the plotthere is one thing i am very glad the film didnt do put in antman or wasp then it would have been too ridiculous,fantasy
epic its a must watch because i had been waiting for this movie for a long time and now that i saw it it was worth the wait everything was perfect the actors did an incredible job the them was phenomenal my siblings enjoyed it but i think i enjoyed it even morei suggest that you stay after the credits there is something more that hints the next movie and some people might like it some people wont like it at all i have been reading comics since i was young and never in my early years would i ever imagine a movie so epic that would make me think back to those times i read the comics i gave it a 1010 because it deserves it and you can tell that they put hard work and dedication into it,fantasy
i am unsure if words could describe how enthusiastic i was about this movie  i do not go to the cinema for many reasons but for this i went twice the cast are more than super heroes they are astoundingly brilliant at portraying the fear anxiety arrogance and sheer audacity of these marvel cartoon heroes  the plot is steady throughout and the reveals are amazing  i wont even try to describe the sfx because they cannot properly be adequately descriptive enough  see it the sure helmsman joss whedon has exploded into a place so many of us whedonites have known about for so long  we lost buffy angel spike etc we lost captain mal and jayne but now joss has finally given the world what we all know hes capable of  an explosion of actionadventure that never fails to amaze engage and to take the breath away  add that to the most fantastic one liners sharp dialogue character focus and the asset that is robert downey jnr as tony starkiron man and youve got a complete set of everything chris hemsworth brings such surety as thor his presence is god like in many ways whilst tom hiddleston plays the most charismatic bad guy in years add in the fantastic hawkeye portrayed brilliantly by jeremy renner  chris evans as captain america and scarlett johanson as black widow  finished off with an awe inspiring performance from mark ruffalo as bruce banner and you pretty much have the most incredible spectacle in cinema history i am a huge fan of the individual movies but this just smashed the lot the size is beyond words and let us not forget what samuel l jackson and clark gregg bring to the cast fantastic brilliant amazing  watch out for the great battles between thor and hulk iron man and hulk and how well they fit into the filmsamuel l jackson is rumoured to have a nick fury movie coming soon  i can hardly wait  i hope jeremy renner and scarlett johanson get their own movies too fabulous way to start the story joss whedon needs to be heralded for his work and television bosses should sit up and see what they miss when a genuinely amazing talent goes to cinema,fantasy

the plot is very simple so there is no need for me to describe the details because its easy to follow bad guy wants to conqueror the world and its up to the superheroes to stop him but firs they have to get along in order to beat the bad guy see its that simpleafter many years of development and anticipation im happy to say that the is one of my favorite films of the year in fact this is one of the greatest comic book films i have ever seen in a long time like most marvel films that had been made its safe to say that the plot was well made although there are cheesy moments here and there it works fine almost every character will deliver one line that will make people laugh primary robert downey jr as tony stark delivers the best lines speaking of which there are some moments of laughters when some characters do some funny acts the delivers some of the best and spectacular action scenes that i seen in a while the last act of the film is noting but pure good action and that is how action genres should be audiences will wow several times in the final act the audiences applauded during the action that tells you how much people are going to like it from the entire marvel superheroes that we got to love over the last couple of years tony stark and the hulk were the best tony stark personality is still the same as in the first two iron man films no one cant play tony stark as good as robert downey jr on the other hand mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk was a perfect candidate ill be honest with you when i first heard that edward norton was not going to return as bruce bannerhulk i was deeply disappointed i was worried that mark ruffalo wasnt going to pull it off but after watching his performance he proved me wrong not only was he able to pull it off but this is the hulk that i was waiting for sure edward norton was good mark ruffalo was greatthe is not perfect though since it was converted in 3d instead of shooting it its not surprising that several scenes will blurry here and there sometimes the special effects were blurry because of the conversion for your own sake dont see it in 3d overall fans are going to be extremely happy with this film regular moviegoers will be entertained let me tell you this after the film was over the audience applauded the film that shows how much the audience loved it this is a dream come true for me and comic book fans out there the is mighty spectacular,fantasy
this is hands down the best super hero movie made todate and ive seen them all at over 2 hours and 20 minutes it is wholly captivating perfectly balancing character development team development which is critical for this movie and eyepopping 3d action this is no small feat bringing together the six heroes even the minor characters are brought to the forefront jeremy renners hawkeye and scarlett johanssons black widow for example enriching their characters and making their action sequences just as cool and dynamicand surprisingly it is the best hulk movie there are two scenes featuring the hulk that will have you laughing so hard youll be in tears youd think iron man would have the coolest action sequences but when the hulk inflicts carnage on the enemies you dont want it to stop this is josh whedons breakout movie no longer will he be known as the guy that made the buffy the vampire slayer series but the guy that made the,fantasy
i saw the non 3d movie and its was the best movie thus far for 2012 story line action teamwork ego fear and humor this movie surprised mei went with a friend to the 1030am showing and it was packed not a seat in the house one recommendation  do not watch any of the trailers be surprised in the movie i didnt watch any spoilers and i thought the movie was excellentall the actors  actresses did an incredible jobmost certainly i will see it again maybe this time i will go see the 3d version,fantasy
when my son first approached me about going to see this movie i said no i wasnt crazy about about some of the lesser characters hawkman black widow and hulk ive never been a hulk fan the pro reviews swayed my opinion so we went to see it imax version 3d and i have to say i was wrong this movie rocked and it was funny too my personal favorite loki says to the hulk i am a godafter the hulk finishes pummeling him he says puny godthe theater erupted in laughter ironman  stark continues to be my favorite he gets the job done and imo is hilarious if you want an good old fashion summertime action filmthis is it,fantasy
this movies gets a 10 out of 10 in my book its funny witty and even at times a little sad however the movie ends beautifully make sure if you go to see it you watch the entire movie there are 2 not one but 2 extra scenes at the end the second you dont see until after the credits roll the best part of the movie in my opinion is the part where all of the and his brother stare down the tip of hawkeyes arrow at loki these people definitely know what there doing hats off to joss whedon for pulling of the movie of the year no the movie of the century thats right folks you heard it here first this is the movie of the century now each of the marvel movies leading up to this thor  captian america  iron man etc all deserve their respect but this movie brings them all together to a fine point and tops them all it may look like a matchup of marvel vs halo but it is definitely in a league of its own,fantasy
this one goes way beyond simply being the final chapter in a themed seriesthe individual marvel movies have been ok hulk to good iron man 1 but the is an order of magnitude better than the best of themthis film is good enough to appeal to the general public but for comic  action fans its is a an exquisite symphony much more than the sum of its parts you will find sublime pathos mixed with humor and it worksi believe it will become a genre defining work as star wars and lord of the rings are it will simultaneously make you want to fight evil serve your country and believe that redemption is still possible for those ready to lay it on the line and become heroes,fantasy
i had been waiting for this movie for a long long time i had big expectations from this movie and needless to say it completely blew me away the movie takes off from the beginning with highoctane but smart action with a couple of breathers and doesnt let go until the very very end i was astounded by the quality of the film itself i knew that i couldnt expect much from this movie in terms of story or character but this movie had more story and character than most movies out in many many years the acting was superb of course robert downey jr delivered and then some but it was because of the superb acting of every actor that made them all relevant joss whedon made sure every character had a significance to the story and film and they most certainly did i never expected much from hawkeye as he had barely been introduced in the marvel universe but towards the end i was cheering him on and scarlett johanssons character of black widow had much more to it in this film than in iron man 2 really in that movie they put her in to look attractive but in this she had legitimate fears and doubts and she was no longer the emotionless fully manipulative character she was in iron man 2 she had a heart in the movie now in terms of the hulk the most tricky of them they absolutely nailed it ruffalo is by far the best hulk great acting by him and the hulk dear god marvelous he steals the show from iron man at the end speaking of iron man tony stark is as funny as ever and he brilliantly shows that in the beginning he had no interest in the initiative as he had been previously rejected but by the end he was as much part of the team as everyone else was they were inseparable by the end and contrary to popular belief stark was not the center of the film whedon made sure of that i began to care more for caps character as well whom i had never been too intrigued by in his movie and as for thor we can see how distressed he is by loki leaving home and his alienation and that thor cares but that he is also willing to fulfill his duty to asgard and all the other realms every single character is relevant and important a la joss whedons incredible filmmaking and writing skills and the brilliance of the actors portraying them the only gripe i could possible have is that the humor occasionally and just occasionally felt random and out of place but this is really not that big of a problem this movie has it all a heart a brain a soul and badass action and awesome in its purest and most enjoyable form i compel everyone and anyone to watch this smart and beyond awesome film as it is way way better than most of the garbage that is being released nowadays i will be seeing this again oh yes i will the is a masterpiece,fantasy

the is the longawaited marvel superhero film since it was announced after the credits in the first iron man film the previous installments leading to the grand beast that is the were iron man iron man 2 the incredible hulk captain america the first avenger and thor the heroes are in case you dont already know are iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner the hulk mark ruffalo and black widow scarlett johansson and theyre all brought together as a team by nick fury samuel l jackson the head of shield theyre mission is basically to stop thors evil brother loki tom hiddleson from taking over the world i really really liked the i didnt seem to love and adore it like many other people do but i thought it was incredibly well made very funny thrilling as hell beautifully written and a lot of fun what really makes the work so well is the characters director joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer serenity did a great job establishing the characters and balancing them and their interactions without it becoming too convoluted it was a little messy in the first 30 minutes or so getting them all together but thats perfectly understandable because you have 6 or 7 major characters and its not an easy job giving each of them a brief introduction then bringing them together joss whedon accomplished it as good as it could have been so he gets points for that that is to say what carries you through the messy first 30 minutes is the script its so cleverly written by joss whedon and zak penn that you dont even care about it constantly going from placetoplace and charactertocharacter because 1 youll be laughing your way through it and 2 its nice to see these beloved characters on the big screen whether the substance is good or not once the heroes are together as a team it gets much better robert downey jr is great as always as iron man always saying wise remarks making fun of the heroes at first and trying to make bruce banner angry mark ruffalo does a good job as bannerhulk bringing something new and fresh to the character that you didnt see in the incredible hulk or hulk 2003 i also have to praise tom hiddleson as loki hes great he delivers a dark and menacing performance thats almost as good as what heath ledger delivered as the joker in the dark knight what can i really say everyone here does a great job its really the script and characters that carry the movie and i cant praise joss whedon enough for smoothly pacing this story with these complex characters so well whedon just makes them work so well together even when they hate each other at first the big 45minute long action finale is thrilling its visually exciting the action is phenomenally awesome and each character has their moment of badassery as well as their big shining moment the hulk steals the show several times especially when he cleans the floor with loki literally this isnt mindless michael bay action its nicely shot and choreographed and theres substance the heroes work together and form a bond and its just great the isnt perfect but overall its as entertaining as it needs to be the only problems i can think of is a flawed but watchable first halfhour and a couple moments that fall flat go in expecting rich and colorful characters clever dialogue large spectacle and fun action and make sure you thank joss whedon on your way out oh and a sequel,fantasy
the is a fans dream come true five years fives films and the most incredible build up in film history leading to this the most ambition filled film ever it couldve fallen flat on its face but the film makers who made it clearly love the heroes involved and wanted to show it in terms of story and character development joss whedon takes his time in letting the film unwind and he lets action show up when its needed the action stunts and cgi all take a backseat to the story and acting which is great whedon lets the characters speak for themselves and lets the story develop at its own pace which is important because all of that leads to the incredible action packed climax the interaction between the heroes shows them bonding and feeling each other out as well as rising to the menace which leads to the formation of the the story ties up dangling plot lines from the other marvel films and comes up with a plot that demands the shield is experimenting with the tesseract a cube of awesome power when loki thors half brother enters our world and after a battle with nick fury and his forces loki takes the tesseract and leaves taking with him some converts his plan is to use the tesseract to open a gateway to let a hostile alien force invade earth and once earth is taken down he will step in and rule it nick fury quickly puts the plan into action and calls forth captain americairon manthe black widowthor and the hulk to help find loki and to battle whatever evil he is about to unleash some bumpy moments happen along the way until they finally form as a team with hawkeye lending a hand if youre a comic book fan this is a supreme moment of triumph for you if youre not then this film will be another one in a long line of action films based on a comic book thats worth seeing,fantasy
first i need to say a big thankyou to disney and marvel studios so pumped up right now how can i even start explaining about the film it was indeed as the title suggests a comic book triumph as i eagerly waited for the movie with high expectations it gave me even more seeing joss whedons direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect the script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor the special effects especially the 3d are literally mind blowing and the action scenes are both hard hitting and beautifully choreographed the actors performances in marvels the are simply awesome and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings robert downey jr will have you in stitches scarlett johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations and tom hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear they balanced everything masterfully good as it gets wow if youre a fan of epic adventure movies then this is your dream come true this is the type of film you fantasized about growing up it really is the ultimate superhero mashup and its done perfectlyi loved this movies depth heart humor gravitas action performances emotion nothing short of amazingsome of my favorite movie quotes were like when stark says to bruce  im a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster and bruce is all like thanks loved how to whole cinema laughed at it also at this one when tony said and i quote guys im bringing the party to you and natasha is all like i dont see why thats the partythe best one when tony wakes up as hulk roared and tony was all like what happenedtell me none of you guys have kissed me and later i wanna eat a shawarma i dont know what it is but theres a shawarma joint and i wanna try itbut again there are so many moments like these and just not explainable you have to watch it to experience it yourself as it is filled with humor and action till the end thats why i recommend everyone to go and watch it again and again thats all,fantasy
what should you do when you have been a self proclaimed fan who has decided that he would make a movie and bring all the superheroes from that universe under one arc step 1 go to the studio bosses and convince them of the ideastep 2 talk to other directors and ask them to incorporate certain elements from the big picture that would help bring the final story in play introduction of nick fury in iron man continue in iron man 2 and captain america black widow in iron man 2 hawkeye in thorstep 3 convince a superhero to play a guest role in another superhero movie iron man offering his consulting services in the incredible hulkstep 4 now that all the superheroes have been linked under the mouthful acronym shields you have the right background to bring the avenger initiative to the foregroundstep 5 go ahead and flesh out the story but make sure you play to the strengths of the each character iron man is sarcastic and arrogant with tongue in cheek one liners so he should get the best lines captain america is the leader so when the time comes he should bring the superheroes together and lead them to the final battle thor is the norse god and the only one who can bring loki to justice hulk is remorseful of his past deeds yet he is still angry indestructible as the green giant and can practically smash anything so his actions should speak louder than any words nick fury is the leader of the avenger initiative and he should do all that is necessary to motivate the super heroes black widow is the spy and her strengths also include close quarter hand to hand combat hawkeye is the expert marksman and practically shoot down anything with the arrows now that you know that the characters and their strengths you should ensure they get on with each others like a house on fire throw in friendly banter ego clashes battle of brawns and brains in good measure then when all hell breaks loose bump off a character to motivate the super heroes to band together then go all out in the climatic battle sequence with action extravagance and general dose of humorstep 6 now add a crackling screenplay to go with that goldmine story and you are almost readystep 7 take it back to the studio bosses and convince them of the plot if need be use a flashy power point it usually works for all corporate presentations and makes everybody happystep 8 now that the studio has green lit the project sign up the actors who will make up the marquee lineup and you are good to gostep 9 if you have the faith then go ahead and direct it bring in a good cinematographer and you are good to go but dont forget to add a crackling soundtrack to match the mayhem on the screennow for the outcome brilliant action impressive 3d effects superb character play and some genuine laugh out loud moments make the one hell of a comic book adaptation it sets the bar pretty high for other super heroes as is the case generally iron man captain america thor hulk pale in comparison to batman spiderman superman individually in terms of popularity and box office pull but when you put them all together in one frame for all to see they sure bring in a lot of fireworks it would do justice to them if you could catch the individual stories of all the super heroes before you go to watch the big one but even if you dont there is a whole lot of essence in this story alone to keep you going this movie has already won big reviews from the critics and fans are raving about it on the fb with loads of stuff dedicated to that special hulk and lokis interaction in the end the big question that crosses all is has joss whedon succeeded in his plans the answer is yes he has changed the comic book to movie adaptation world and taken it to a whole new level the bar is set pretty high for spiderman and batman who follow up this year with their own series so for the time being let us enjoy the ride of the,fantasy
im a huge fan of marvel movies but first of all i must say i did not read the comics cause its impossible to find them here in turkeyso some of the comic readers may think differently10 points to the script writer the lines were so good we laughed so hard especially in the first half it was written so perfectlyi loved it10 points to the director the directing was so nice especially after the disaster we had with huger games last month with the shaky camerascreens were richly developed loved it too10 points to the visuals god its a massive production it was even better than i had exceptedit is so much better than all the marvel movies beforethere are plenty of scenes i said wow in summary definitely go and see itsee it in the theatre in 3dyou are gonna have a great timenext time we are gonna see it againwe had to make it to the movie in half an hour we came from a distant town to the city centeri exceeded the speed limit and police wrote me a ticket but after the movie i said  it was worth it,fantasy
as i reflect on my experience tonight watching the one word comes to mind awesome the movie was simply awesome the action scenes were the best ive seen in any recent movie and the comedy was excellent it seems that superhero movies these days have become parodies of themselves and for that reason the movies are even better the audience and the actors are all in on the jokes together and for that the audience feels delighted and laughs to make the greatness of this movie more relatable here is a list of things that are equal to the movie in excellence 1 donald trumps commitment in a losing battle to prove obama african 2 obamas actually being american 3 womens sports 4 bashing womens sports 5 powerful showerheads 6 showerhead 7 the lifespan of the nintendo 64 8 the triplechinned woman working at burger king who wears a grumpy shirt to let the customers know she is grumpy the woman is in fact grumpy you know what youre getting yourself into 9 that dudes facial hair in the hunger games 10 having your cake and eating it too and then going to brag to your friends about the cake that you got to eat but they didnt get to eat and then they tell you that all of those carbs and sugar will go to your hips and butt but you dont believe them and you dont really care because that cake was excellent i hope you could relate to at least one of these excellent things to see just how great this movie really is its like a mix between fergie and jesus not only will you enjoy this movie but the will also solve many issues 1 relationship problems 2 erectile dysfunction those are actually all the problems this movie will solve in conclusion this movie was awesome and spoiler alert scarlett johansson is gorgeous in this film much love james hardenps selena gomez if you are reading this cool,fantasy
just came back from watching it my oh my this movie is incredible joss whedon really put together a masterpiece perfect combination of action and comedy and even heartfelt moments this movie right here is years of build up years of anticipation and after 5 movies its finally here and it is perfect im not going to say much i will just list the main characters as reference for the fans of each bruce bannerhulk hulk stole the show from the minute he appeared till the end he had me at the edge of my seat the amount of awesome cannot be explained stark was right lokis army wasnt anything compared to the hulk he definitely deserves more that what hes gotten with the movie the incredible hulk some sort of reboot perhaps iron man typical stark that everyone loves the life of the party witty snarky smart hilarious but he was also motivated so motivated in fact that he risked his life at one point of the movie class captain america they really succeeded in meshing rogers in he once again shows his fighting spirit and leadership skills and that shield might as well be considered a superhero with that shield in his hands rogers knew that he was overshadowed by the raw power from some of the but he didnt care he just did his job to protect society youll never find a better guy than this thor the other powerhouse besides hulk for some reason i thought thor would be somewhat irrelevant and i dont know why i was wrong thor showed compassion on many occasions his motive was simple yet moving he really brushed aside the fact that he is a god amongst men for the most part and genuinely wanted to be a part of the widow  hawkeye most people brushed aside these two as irrelevant these two are human beings and nothing more i guess thats what makes them so special two human beings widow with her world class fighting skills and hawkeye with his master archery take on an entire alien race to save humanity theyll do anything in their power to help that in its own is something to respect loki the sneaky cunning loki equipped with the tesseract and a smile that will make you tremble in fear he is the main enemy tom hiddleston plays him flawlessly all in all this movie was amazing i honestly want to spend another 11 to see it again a genuine contender for best superhero movie ever for those of you who havent seen it see it now you will not regret it,fantasy
i promise i am not exaggerating when i say that the is probably the best superheroaction film ever made from start to finish its amazing im sure everyone knows that besides the dark knight every other comic book film adaption has always has its flaws each movies not being quite there yet but believe me when i say this movie is the epidomy of what a superhero film is supposed to be joss whedon and zak penn are definitely knowledgeable in writing a solid script the plot of course is your typical action filma sinister bad guy wants to take over the world and the hero must rise to the occasion and protect earth and mankind before its too late with these type of movies i dont believe that there needs to be a complex over the top plot so if youre expecting something like the matrix or inception you came to the wrong movie first of all every actor embodies their character with such an ease that they were all a joy to watch on screen robert and both chriss are definitely iron man thor and captain america without a shadow of a doubt but i was really impressed with scarlett johannsen and mark ruffalos portrayal of black widow and hulk the last two hulk movies were okay but ruffalo definitely gave the hulk more depth as a character hulk stole the screen every time he was on camera i was sad when people booed him after finding out he would be playing the hulk but i think his performance left everyone in the movie happy but black widowher cameo and fight scene in iron man 2 definitely made me say this girl is bad ass but i got a chance to see more of an emotional side of this deadly assassin even though she is lethal there were moments where her eyes would water in the midst of a situation and youre like damn i love this girl because you feel connected but i must say tom hiddleston played an awesome villain i may get shot for saying this but i thought his performance was right up there with ralph fiennes in his portrayal of voldemort in the harry potter saga also jeremy renner as hawkeye was very impressive and a shocker some people didnt think his character needed to be in this film but renner definitely proved them very wrongan inhibition i have with a lot of action films is two things either theirs a lot of action but no storycharacter development or their a lot of story and character development but not a lot of action this movie has boththank you mr whedon every action scene is superb and memorable in its own way unique way it seems like a lot of directors like to rush the editing and the story and even the action scenes when there is a lot to cover but whedon definitely took his time and made sure the audience was in the moment with each of the character by the way i love a good standoff moment and the part in the end where all six heroes are standing in a circle back to back and the camera is panning around themtotally epic the special effects were also amazing and seemed almost real i know a lot of thought has to go into planning very intricate fight scenes when the it involves six to nine heroes fighting dozens of soldiers or an alien army of hundreds but every shot every action every move was definitely well thought out i really wonder how long it took them to film that final battle it was probably the best ive ever seen in my life even though im only twenty threei think the best part of this entire movie was that it was laugh out loud funny from start to finish joss whedon definitely has a sense of humor and of course each actor brings their character to life and it makes you relate to them as they spit out sarcastic dry arrogant humor to each other it was fun to watch because it was like seeing a family bicker during thanksgiving dinner seeing all six heroes together in one room arguing non stop over differences was great on screen chemistry i think when directors make an action movie with a team they fail to show the connection between them what makes them a team why do they stick together but i loved the group dynamic it was like a struggle of egos in the beginning which was definitely realistic in my own opinion this movie is flawless anybody who finds something wrong with it is probably just uptight or a dc universe fan and are scared that the new batman film wont gross half as much as the will i tell everyone that the best way to enjoy a movie is to go in with no expectations and take it for what it is i played the game on sega genesis with my brothers when i was little but i had no extensive knowledge of anything remotely connected to the but this film has made me a big fan thank you joss whedon for setting the bar higher than high and letting these other hollywood directors know that they better step their game up or find a job at their local mcdonalds joss whedon chris evans robert downey jr chris hemsworth mark ruffalo scarlett johansen jeremy renner tom hiddleston samuel l jackson and the rest of the cast thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing the world why i chose to go to film school i left the theater overjoyedand im an xmen fan hahaha,fantasy
if you had asked me a few months ago if i was exited for the i would have said a little bit but then the trailer made my jaw drop when i saw the giant snake decepticon from transformers 3 crash through that building while chasing iron man so i joined the many who got hyped for this film in fact like many others i had an marathon leading up to it and i can say that this is the best movie weve gotten so far it has everything i liked from the other five while taking out some of the stuff i didntlets just get a few problems i had out of the way like the other five there are points where it does feel slow and gets a little boring but they are few and far in between at times it focused too much on one member and not enough on the others some of the effects were clearly cgi and it might be a little too long i know its only about an hour and eleven minutes but it did feel a little longerother than that i really enjoyed this movie the action scenes are great especially the final battle so much stuff gets destroyed there was one shot that reminded me of that action scene in tintin where they have one continuous shot go to all the members of the fighting it doesnt last as long but it was still cool most of the time the special effects were good and i really liked the characters iron man was hilarious which is the way i think he should be robert downey jr is great thor was a little more serious this time and it actually worked i dont know how but it did black widow was hot hawkeye was cool and i actually really liked the hulk he had the absolute funniest scene in the movie the acting all around is good and i actually thought loki was a great villain in thor he was ok but i always knew thor could beat him in this he actually gets pretty far and it made me wonder how the would defeat him and that is a big strength for this movie theres actually quite a bit of suspensei didnt think i would say this but the is my favorite movie of the year so far there are a few flaws but overall i was very impressed with this movie see it,fantasy
with five previous marvel movies building up to this it has a lot to live up to and boy does it deliver on every level this movie is the definition of a popcorn blockbuster the last time i had this much fun watching a marvel movie was iron man but iron man can now step back and crawl under the shadow of the awesomeill start off by saying that almost all of the credit should go to joss whedon for his superb talent in writing and directing an allstar ensemble like this his previous movie serenity showed that he has a niche for cleverly directing an ensemble and the only concretes his skill every super hero and spy in this movie gets their screen timeas most would come to expect robert delivers the most witty lines and laughs as iron man but for me mark ruffalo and his angry counterpart stole the show as bruce banner he has charm and a lot of heart as the hulk he had the the whole theater clapping and laughing and wanting more finally we have a great hulk the rest of the cast and characters get their dues as you would expect and deliver a ton of fun michael bay take note from the new king of the blockbuster the lives up to the hype wait it blows the hype out of the water its that good i just want more pleaseoh and stay for the credits but only fans of the comics will get it and cry tears of joy,fantasy
so awesome those were the first two words that came to mind as i scoured my brain in an effort to find a fitting description of what i had just witnessed why be loquacious when two such honestly efficient words will do come on what else do you want me to say the hits the ground in overdrive downs a sixpack of energy drinks and rarely takes a breath during the course of its purely entertaining 142 minute runtimeburdened with a glorious purpose loki tom hiddleston makes his presence known quickly he comes to earth to rule and leaves nick fury samuel l snakes on a plane jackson and his awesome eyepatch with no choice but to revisit the failed initiative the film recognizes that there are a lot of male egos that need clashing and thus wastes no time in delivering exactly what the audience wants to see  2 hours of superhero blissas intense and exhilarating as the climactic 40 minute battle against loki and his minions is the hero vs hero alpha male vs alpha male build up is even better captain america vs thor iron man vs thor thor vs hulk hawkeye vs black widow come on now i think i even saw a kitchen sink in there battling it out director joss whedon clearly thought through the scenarios that fans would want and he flawlessly delivers them with style a little panache if you will executing the individual battles in a way that does justice to the characters is not an easy task but the special effects and 71 surround sound are crafted to perfectionif youve seen the individual avenger movies then you know exactly what to expect from the characters tony stark robert downey jr cracks wise with his sarcastic humor thor chris hemsworth cracks heads with his magic hammer captain america chris evans cracks nary a smile with his oldschool nononsense patriotism and hulk mark ruffalo well he just smashesadd black widow scarlett johansson the former russian assassin and hawkeye jeremy renner a master with the bow and arrow to the mix and that is a whole lot of superheroes demanding a limited amount of screen time the good news is whedon handles this potential problem seamlessly giving everybody ample time to do their thing and play their part the biggest surprise both literally and figuratively has to be the hulk not only is this the most realistic version of the beloved green rage monster thats been delivered to the big screen but he simply steals every scene hes inthe is the kind of roller coaster thrill ride of a movie that takes me back to the magic i felt as a kid every time i walked into the theater and sat down to watch a muchanticipated summer blockbuster its a refreshing blend of humor and action that lets you check out of your reality for a couple of hours and check into an exciting world where good triumphs evil and it does so in marvelously inventive waysif you cant enjoy the then i fear you simply cant enjoy life shoot me an email and well see if we cant introduce some joy into your world,fantasy
if you loved all of marvels other movies then youll worship thisi will conduct this review into 3 sections characters story and verdict as opposed to my usual pros and cons of my earlier reviewscharacters robert downey jr as tony starkiron man the best way to start this review is to start it with the character that brought them all together industrial billionaire tony stark made his first epic film appearance in 2008s iron man directed by jon favreu and then appeared again in iron man 2 in 2010 his character is pretty much the same as he was in his previous films so there wont be much to say hes very exaggerated in this one and is much more comical and sarcastic than an arrogant self obsessed businessman in his solo movies but also shows an emotion that weve never seen before from the character and that is anger he expresses it extremely well but the scene where he exposes it in all good conscience can not be explained here as you must see the film to understand his portrayal as the character when hes in a conflict with any of the other team mates is played exceptionally well and is put into some great scenes especially with captain america theres nothing more to say except that hes played with wit seriousness and greatness by the perfectly cast robert downey jr chris evans as steve rogerscaptain america evans portrayal of the patriotic soldier is played very different to his portrayal in his solo movie because its played more serious and emotional as he is out of his 1940s lifestyle so we can truly understand his sadness and what hes going through instead of him being the overly confident soldier we saw in captain america the first avenger he is more of a reluctant leader that knows he needs to do the things he needs to do in order to save his country and his planet as its his priority his role as a team leader is shown to full effect as he gives orders takes orders and kicks ass its actually very difficult to talk about the character in a fully detailed way as weve only seen the character once but if i could say anything its that chris evans was perfectly cast in the role and im looking forward to his character being developed furthermark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk in the span of almost as decade weve gone through 3 different bruce banners but i can proudly say that mark ruffalo is perfect for the role he may not be the most sophisticated or eccentric one of any of the banners but damn it hes committed he didnt talk very loud throughout the whole thing and i think thats good because this is a man that has to stay calm and quiet to bottle up his rage so he stays quiet in order to cooperate with the other team members nicely but that doesnt stop him in other words dont get him angry you wouldnt like him when hes angrychris hemsworth as thor the fourth and final major marvel character to talk about as ill talk about black widow hawkeye nick fury and loki in smaller detail as this isnt really their movie thor is once again played with such power and force that he absolutely disappears into the character unlike his portrayal in his 2011 solo movie which was also released next to captain america thor is played out as less of an idiot and more as a powerful god who is extremely passionate about stopping his brother loki whom he cares about so much even though he has done so many terrible things just like how i spoke about the previous 2 characters it is way too early to talk about thor in intense detail but all i can say is that youre going to love the hell out of chris hemsworths performance he was funny cool and completely awesome samual l jackson jeremy renner scarlett johansson and tom hiddleston all give great performances that all match the mood of the film whether its a serious moment or a comedic moment actually the comedy is a key part of the film as its everywhere the 2 main comical parts are from villainous loki and the awesome hulk story the story is very solid and enjoyable it doesnt mess around and gets straight to the point it also has a very good opening scene that i am not going to spoil the action in the film is played out very well and fits in with the characters and the story basically nick fury of shield gathers a supergroup known as the to stop thors brother loki from enslaving the human race the story does sound quite clich but its marvel and mustnt be taken seriously thats the dark knight rises job the basic story isnt much of an exciting thing as its in every superhero film ever made but it doesnt matter because the explosive action sequences and stan lee make it all up verdict nothing major except that this is truly an experience and must be seen by everyone written and directed by joss whedon based on the created by stan lee and jack kirbystarring robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston and samuel l jackson,fantasy
we waited a long time for this movie an extremely long time after years of waiting have i emphasized the waiting part yet years of hits iron man thor misses the incredible hulk and disappointments iron man 2 we get the longawaited reunion of all of the accessible to disney marvel heroes that eventually form the league of heroes known as the this film is blockbuster fanfare at its finest as this will please the newbie newschool marvel fans as well as your hardcore oldschoolersthe plot is very straightforward very simple loki you know him from thor has arrived in the united states and steals this ultrapowerful sphere to attempt to take over the entire planet your classic comic book tale nick fury attempts to unite several of the wellknown superheroes that had remained under the watch of shield over the years in order to bring loki to intergalactic justice its a good ol good vs evil plot that paces like a comic book in terms of withholding the juicy content until the final actwhat makes this movie work is the superb script that is full of oneliners full of complex interactions between our heroes that all come from very different backgrounds and contains more than enough room to allow for action and mayhem to conquer the screen joss whedons style can clearly be heard through the dialogue and his rabid cult following which is the strongest in media aside from tarantino will devour every moment of itwhat also makes this movie work is the phenomenal amount of action that youll see from the beginning to the end plenty of fights plenty of carnage plenty of heroes working together and best of all they make up for the recent marvel movies that had been sorely lacking in material every hero has their moment to shine from the fan favorite iron man to even the weaker hawkeye and hulk gets to smash a lot and boy does he deliver in ways you wouldnt expect an added bonus is that our heroes despite having flaws and limitations are definitely likable enough for you to root for themeven the hulk who had been extremely poorly characterized over the yeadecades in media you have the great acting ensemble to thank for thatbutthe is a great movie dont get me wrong it will be worth your pennies but you can tell they were quite limitedpart of the appeal of the comic books were the cameo surprises and supervillians as well as the heroes instead we have a villain that already was featured in a prior movie as well as nameless faceless boring baddies and no cameos one can only imagine if disney actually pushed for the ability to bring in the marvel characters already owned by other movie companies then the potential will explode and reach levels of awesomeness that we see only in the comic booksand for those of you that tell me movie companies working together is not possible i bring exhibit a who framed roger rabbita disney movieif we ever were to see the reach its full potential we need to see hollywood work together and be willing to bend a few rules until then we get this a great fun movie and potentially great franchise marred by its limited resources,fantasy
i knew this movie was going to be good but i thought 96 on rottentomatoes and 89 on imdb was a little too much for a movie like this oh boy how wrong i was this film was not good it was epic with all caps and an exclamation markwe have all our favorite heroes in a single movie played by some great actors driven by over the top special effects and coordinated by a skillful director who also rocks with the dialogs i think it took a great deal of preproduction and inproduction work by joss wheedon to make these unique characters work well in a single film and he did a terrific job in keeping together all these amazing actorsthere was no dull moment in this film it was very well paced wonderfully done and greatly enjoyed the first half consisted of getting all the heroes together introducing the plot and the characters but it was done with such finesse that i didnt even realize how long this part took the film was very entertaining throughout with hilarious comic reliefs exciting action and wonderful score by alan silvestrii loved when all of the were together and just talked because the awesome script really showed their character and why theyre not really good as a team but they finally got on with each other and the final battle commenced  the most epic final battle after of course lord of the rings theres a shot in this scene which just blew my mind it was a single shot with no cuts at all showing all the characters fighting the alien hordes and it was just fantastici first felt sad when i heard edward norton wont be reprising his role as bruce banner but as soon as mark ruffalo appeared on screen i thought way better than ed norton they made a great choice in casting him he was much more convincing and less greedy norton may be angry with himself but he wont turn green anymorewhat joss wheedon did really well is that he deepened all the supporting characters weve seen in the other films we learned a lot about black widow about hawkeye and even about agent coulson the writer is really great with all the different characters because it feels like were watching people who could very well exist not just superhero cardboard cutouts most films like this  ahem superman ahem  only have thati can honestly say i loved the i dont care if its too mainstream the superhero movies are my favorite subgenre i recommend it to all watch it love it enjoy it i cant wait for more,fantasy
first of all i will not be referring to this film by the crap uk name of assembled the film is the and that all it needs to be calledthis is biggest and most anticipated film from the last few years it is a sequel to the marvel films iron man 2008 iron man 2 2010 thor 2011 captain america 2011 and the incredible hulk 2008 but is it possible to make one film starring them all would it work with all of them in lead roles the film brings together iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans  the hulk mark ruffalo along with shield agents hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarlett johansson and nick fury samuel l jackson they join forces against thors brother loki tom hiddleston who has unleashed an alien race upon the earth so he can conquer itas many of you will know by now i am a huge action movie and comic adaption fan so this film exactly what i was looking for i kept away from many reviews and possible spoilers however i had to see the trailers after seeing them and being blown away i got a little worried for the film many trailers use so much of the action and plot that they show most of the good parts of the film i really hoped that this wouldnt happen with this one i wanted this film to be goodafter the first 5 minutes i was worried the film started out well but there was a really really bad camera cutedit for a film fan it stood out and slapped me in the face i started to worry that it was a sign of things to come however my fears were soon dispelled as the film sucked me in with outstanding direction visuals and 3d effects like i have never seen before the way the film was prepared starting out with iron man in 2008 and then tying in all the following films together are a big lead up to this one a huge gamble but it really paid off the outstanding cast work so well together with all these larger than life characters already having their own individual stories told all what was left was to bring them together but first they start out against each other their individual egos explode as they battle each other with explosive devastation soon they all share a common goal and start to band together then the film really lets to up until this point it was amazing when they finally start working together thats when an amazing movie exceeds all expectations and takes the superhero genre to a level never before seen this is also the point then the 3d effects take on a whole new level prior to this they were used for depth and clarity of the film very well but now it bring you in to the film and doesnt let go the greatest effect is an alien ship appearing from over your head it actually startled me as it appeared above my head before it was on the screen never before outside of a theme park has a 3d film managed thisfortunately it didnt just meet my expectations it exceeded them more than i ever thought possible i really cant find the right words to convey how good this film really is it has moments where you laugh so hard you cry amazingly the best of these involve the hulk there are moments where you find yourself holding your breath at the sheer scope of what you are seeing the action raises the bar for the genre to maybe unattainable heights this film is so very goodi usually rate films on a scale of 110 but 10 feels inadequate for this so for this one i am using 1100 this film scores a 99 only losing out on 100 due to the single bad edit at the start of the film joss whedon has managed the impossible with this film and pulled of a film no one expected to be so good for this reason and for the first time my stand out performance is the director joss whedon for creating a perfect superhero movieyou have to see this on the biggest screen you can find and in 3d,fantasy
before i saw i was expecting to see a action heavy film with little or no script and now that i have seen it i can say that i was very surprised by the dialogues and the script the script was witty smart and well written the main plot was of course simple that of a man in this case a god wanting to take over the world but apart from that clich plot point the script was very good it was more character based than plot based the movie gave enough individual time to the heroesother than hawkeye in terms of screen time the point of the film was a team assembling and that team dynamic was brilliantly written and acted the heroes fought they disagreed they had different opinions to things they had different reasons to go to war but at the end despite their differences they came together this team dynamic was brilliantly handled by joss whedon the script was funny at times as well joss whedon knew that the wasnt supposed to be a dark knight it wasnt supposed to be realistic and gritty and scattered with various themes so instead of making a mindless michael bay film he added his own unique touches which gave the movie and the characters depth while also preserving the summer blockbuster flavour each character played a specific part in this team captain america played the loyalbound by duty super soldier who turns out to be a brilliant tactician as well iron man provided the team with flying abilities and brilliant weaponry thor had personal reasons to fight this battle while hulk well he was an unstoppable monster the scope of this film is huge unlike any other super hero film the opposition that these heroes faced could not be dealt by one hero alone and hence the stakes in this movie are much higher and the heroes know that some realistic themes were also introduced like whether shield should make nuclear weapons to protect itself from the other worldly armies these themes were quite relevant in todays times there were quite a few smart writing choices that whedon made that i cant talk about without giving spoilers the acting as expected was brilliant robert downey chris evans mark rufallo scarlett johansonchris hemsworth and jeremy renner were all brilliant at their roles the black widow got more screen time then i expected but that was welcome the action i thought was very large scale although i think and i know many might disagree with me but the action could have been more grander in some parts all in all this movie was everything it was supposed to be it balanced the scriptthe dialoguesthe characters and the action very well dont compare this to the dark knight cause this is not supposed to be gritty and intense just be happy that the movie gives to you more than you expected it to i dont know how marvel is going to top this but lets just hope they do,fantasy
ive been watching joss whedons work since buffy the vampire slayer was first released and my god he just gets better and betternot only did he write a fabulous script for the but he directed the hell out of it too  it was brilliant perfect comedy elements mixed in with eyepopping actionsome people complained in reviews of the movie saying that there were too many strong personalities in the lead and one character seemed to shine above the others but thats just not true  they all shine in their own way robert downey jr with his exquisite technical lingo mark ruffalo with his anger management chris hemsworth with his australian godliness jeremy renner with his gorgeous lips scarlett johansson with her bendiness tom hiddleston with his best of british bad boy attitude chris evans with his pure of heart and last but by no means least samuel l jackson who in my eyes is just awesome whatever he is doing,fantasy
you dont need me to tell you its the culmination of a fiveyear plan that began with samuel l jacksons nick fury taking tony stark aside at the end of the first iron man to tip him off as to the initative there is a bigger picture he told him  and here it is the beall but not theyre hoping the endall of the current craze for cgienhanced super heroics interspersing flip oneliners with a host of largerthanlife characters and the usual flurry of fightandflight scenes the film is never less than amusing still its never more than amusing either marvel studios has made it a point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the dc  warner bros batman films the lightness is fun but it doesnt offer much of a foundation on which to build an epic and lets face it theres more than a whiff of opportunism about a project that pits a defrosted world war ii hero captain america chris evans an inventorindustrialist iron man robert downey jr the pagan lightning god thor chris hemsworth a scientist with anger management issues hulk mark ruffalo and shield agents black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner against the norse god of mischief loki tom hiddleston and a legion of marauding aliens in 3dmeet the boss of the chris hemsworth is thor chatting with the iron man 2 cast still whedon who shares a screenplay credit with zak penn is a very sharp operator he knows which buttons to press and where theres room for a little diversion the improbability of this misfit coalition becomes the movies most rewarding asset imagine the bristling egos of so many power players cooped up in the same room the movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground standoffs not surprisingly robert downey jrs flip cynical stark iron man gets a good measure of the movies best lines bouncing off steve rogers captain america boy scout idealism and thors guileless sledgehammer style sometimes literally whedon also crafts a couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for scarlett johanssons black widow a far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in iron man 2great action 3d is the best up till now robert downey jr is hilarious n is the glue that holds the movie together hulk come in last but is the best in the movie,fantasy
first off let me spell out that yes i am a marvel fan but i fall more into category x ive read maybe 10 books ever most of which were the ultimates so i went into this less a fanboy and more someone who loves movies and has like many been wildly intrigued by this new attempt at cinematic world building that truly hasnt been done before not a franchise a whole world that never has to be rebooted because once established the stories that can be told within this lets face it wildly profitable world are near limitless in variations past typical sequels something happened at the end of iron man at the time it seemed to many like a really fun aside but many took it as a promise a promise to fans and filmgoers alike that marvel was greasing the wheels for something really special and come hell or high water they were going to find a way to make the impossible happenwell earlier tonight i witnessed the impossiblei could go through and list my favorite scenes but you dont really need to hear that from me you need to see this for yourself this isnt a film to be experienced secondhand and be spoiled inside and out this is an experience like all new things there are some birthing pains namely tying four film histories together and unifying them into one cohesive plot within the first 20 minutes is a task i dont envy anybody and considering how much screen time is required to solidify these characters as individuals and then a team theres not much room for the villains not loki mind you i think minute for minute he may get more screen time than anybody and thats not a bad thing but his army are little more than alien stormtroopers and just as effective but you know what it wasnt their movie this was a movie about men and women who are their own worst enemies more often than not fragments that come together to form a whole thats what this whole adventure is really about coming together assembling if you will i can say with no shortage of giddy enthusiasm that everyone succeeded the filmmakers succeeded in bringing us these stories we succeeded in supporting them and together we got one cool f movie out of it and after this weekend alone and the contracts already secured for all the players the surefire promise of more to come,fantasy
i was highly dubious going into the theater for this movie almost walked out before it started i work at a movie theater and therefore didnt spend any money on it so leaving before it started would not have had any negative effect on my bank account the only reason i stayed i was already there and i dont go in to work for another 14 hoursas stated in the subject not a superhero movie fan not even a comic book fan not since my 20s that being said i knew very little about the characters and thus had no preconceived notions about how they should be represented except for hulk while i didnt like the edward norton version or the post 911 watered down violent first movie i did actually like how he actually looks like the actor portraying him the other two movies hulk was almost a separate entity completely losing facial notoriety of his weaker self plus he actually has human facial expressions instead of just gritted teeth and growlingas i said before not a comic book fan went in knowing very little if anything at all of black widow or hawkeye honestly i thought hawkeye was a dc character but i guess i was wrong never really liked cappy or thor and didnt like iron man until rdj started playing him so basically i went in with little knowledge of the modern characters and only really was looking forward to one out of sixwithout giving anything away this movie was the best thing ive seen in years ive always been more of a transformers fan and i thought those movies were epic visually as well as story and acting power i never dreamed i would rank the above my beloved transformers but here i am doing just that some people state the movie was too long agree to disagree movies like this should always be a minimum of 2 hours this movie could stand to have been a tad longer which im sure it will be when it comes to bluray im sure some of the hardcore comic book or superhero nerds will find exception to this review and the movie itself someone is always disappointed im just glad i was not one of them although if i had been i got in for free and had little ventured but 2 hours and 15 minutes i would never get backin about 9 hours im going to wake up and take my kids to see it looking forward to the 2 hours and 15 minutes running time because once the movie gets going it just about takes a brick wall or the hulks sixpack to stop it if youre a hardcore superhero nerd you will see it if you are not a hardcore superhero fan and like fun unrealistic action movies this one is for youhope theres a sequel,fantasy

thanks to names like michael bay and most recently peter berg movies that had all the makings of a motion picture event went from ridiculous to ludicrous in the short time it took a movie patron to feel the phantom pinch of money lost forever but not if joss whedon has anything to say about it and say he does in what has to be the best superhero action movie spectacle in a long long time whedon gives you value and oomph two sides of a coin if you will for every buck you have put aside to watch this moviein epic form both visually and cinematically whedons screenplay begins where iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger ends a common thread running through these movies is nick fury director of shield and proprietor of a task force albeit superhuman put together to protect a sustainable energy source called the tesseract from falling into the wrong hands but it does and those hands belong to loki thors conniving adopted brother who arrives unannounced and steals the tesseract following this prologue fury assembles the from new york to calcutta iron man black widow thor captain america hawkeye and the hulk converge on a mission to prevent loki from exerting his devious plans however before our heroes can say lock and load they have to first learn a painful lesson about he values of humility and unitythere are innumerable ways that make this movie a cinematic event for 2012 as the screenwriter and director whedons first nuance is in hoisting this movie way above the hype it created ever since trailers piqued global interest last year up until now we knew something big was brewing within the confines of the marvel universe yet as we have seen before very few film makers have succeeded in simultaneously pleasing marvel fanboys as well as action movie fans again this is where whedon cuts a niche for himself in satisfying diehard comic book fans alongside a generic cinema audience clueless about the two worlds that exist between marvel and dc from a cinematic standpoint whedon also goes as far as busting the myth that quantity is better than quality with a plethora of hollywood alisters suited up in peculiar costumes i dare say the narration ensures that each of their characters add an equal and important input to the story what i like about this is whedons method of giving each superhero 15 minutes of egotistical fame and then letting them pummel each other before receiving another round of motherless beatings from loki and his unsightly army during all this the story is structured as such that none of our heroes actually gain dominance over the others yes viewers will eventually find an individual preference but whedon has cleverly taken the reliance on a main protagonist out of the equation personally though i enjoyed every moment bruce banner turned into the other guy then there is the icing on the cake  whedons well written dialogue void of clichs but rife with wit speaking of wit this has to be the first superhero action movie induced with so much humor that at times it is possible to miss a joke here and there as such whedons slight of hand is the perfectly timed moments when you are made to laugh right in the middle of an intense battle scene brilliantwithout doubt character portrayals are just spot on with all actors in top form as expected robert downey jr brings his usual flamboyance as the billionaire philanthropist tony stark aka iron man chris evans is even better in his second outing as captain america and is convincing as a 1940s hero grappling with current times again witty sarcasm between these two characters are well written and well placed other standouts are mark ruffalo as the timid bruce banner with a furious green giant lurking within scarlett johansson as the sensuous and buttkicking shield agent and jeremy renner as the skilled archer hawkeye watch out for this guy an up and coming oneman action movie hero rumored to take big names in some long running movie franchises centrally positioned as the antagonist tom hiddlestons loki brings along a malignant delusion to rule earth whose only nonhuman deterrent is chris hemsworths fellow norse god thor as polar opposites both characters benefit from immersive depth by hiddleston and hemsworth each having upped the notch since their previous team up in thorcentrally themed most superhero movies are about saving the world from annihilation with that premise done to death whedons forte is in rolling out the plausibility that societys menace cannot be brought down with the will of just one strong individual clearly embedded is the message that it takes unity and a lot of heart to put up a worthy defense against any and all forms of evil before the end of summer a lone hero lurking in the dark will try to prove otherwise for now it suffices to say that whedon has raised the bar and in the process gives marvel a shiny new upgrade for now,fantasy
ok so ive been sat here for ages trying to write a review of the that actually does the movie justice its so hard to say how amazingbrilliantout of this world the movie actually was as no words i can think of express how i thought about this film there was not 1 point in the movie that i drifted off into lala land my thoughts were more like i dont want this film to end i was a little uncertain of how all these mega movie stars were all going to fit into 1 movie well a massive well done to joss whedon if you dont get goosebumps every time one superhero meets another then you clearly have something wrong with you like im not even joking go to the doctors or something the effort that was put into that to make sure it was pulled off was well phenomenal this was my biggest concern about the movie and i for one was not left disappointed the back story of all the characters were impeccably placed whedon took the time needed to reintroduce you to each character which i guess for people who live under rocks its perfect for however i wasnt bored watching this it needed to be in the movie to remind you of each heros struggle and why they are the way they are it made you fight with yourself to try and think who you loved the most thorfor me this is the best movie i have seen in a long time and is the best marvel movie i have seen yes im saying it agree or not it has heaps of action it has so much humor it will leave you belly laughing for ages enough to miss what other characters are saying no characters are overshadowed the fight scenes are superb and captain america still has all his charm and cheese for me the hulk stole the show i was at comic con when the announcements for the were made mark ruffalo got so much stick and still has until this day well to all you people that thought he couldnt pull it off and thought he was going to ruin the movie eat your own words you will come out of this film knowing that him being in it has made it something extra special,fantasy
joss whedon is a genius the ability to bring this cast and these characters together and actually make a pretty phenomenal movie is a tremendous accomplishment but even more than that he was able to finally make the hulk true to his comic book character ie funny and bad ass he even made dull captain america and thor entertaining but the true star of the film has to be robert downey jr without his comic relief in the first 23 of this film this movie would have bombed miserably i understand the importance of character development but its tony stark downey who steals the show and makes the film bearablekudos to scarlett johansson her role as black widow was really a thing of beauty strong female roles are hard to find in hollywood much less play with true abandonment however johansson shines on the screen as the kickass siren with any good action adventure an evil antagonist equally as wicked as his counterparts are good must be pertinent to the films plot to be a successful film in this case tom hiddleston reprises his role as loki thors evil half brother as cements his role as screen villain extraordinairehowever the crowning part of the whole film has to be the films final 30 minutes the ending battle of good vs evil is fantastic the many oneliners come fast and furiously and the action sequences are out of this world literally at a cost of 220 million to make you can definitely see it up on the screen i am sure with salaries percentage payoff to the actors and director josh whedon that it will be a very long time before paramount sees any profits to this film moreover gathering all these stars again for a sequel is also highly unlikely so enjoy this very entertaining bit of nostalgia while you can i highly recommend seeing this film i would even suggest paying the additional cost to see it in imax i am sure the ending battle sequence will be more that worth the cost of admission the summer has started off with a bang lets hope the momentum continues see more of my reviews  the faris reel on facebook,fantasy
firstly if i could rate this higher i most certainly would i went in the cinema expecting a good movie and unlike the rest of the marvel movies which were done superbly i thought the director joss whedon would not keep up to the benchmark the rest of the movies have set in fact he has raised that benchmark so high that the movie was absolutely stunning all heroes had a very special role and that was shown clearly and efficiently as usual you would not expect much humour in a film of this genre but the have certainly made that one of their most prized attributesthe hulk impressed me the most having watched the previous hulk movies i did not think mark ruffalo hulk would get me interested but the hulk made the movie humorous and exciting for the audience showing colossal amounts of power and rage the black widow definitely showed that she is more than just a pretty face showing her skills and amazing figure working together with hawkeye who has made a genuinely interesting entrance as presumed iron man does not fail to impress with his down to earth personality and high tech equipment which play a very important role in keeping the intactmoreover thor makes a outstanding entrance showing himself trying to keep his brother loki under control who on the other hand is an exquisite villain furthermore captain america shows himself and his shield worthy of being in the squad nick fury does play a dominant and influential role his character is explained in more detail as he shows authority over thethe only downside to watching this movie would be the 3d i found that a movie of this standard must be watched glasses free to experience pure brilliancethe movie has exceeded expectation amazing screen play by all characters terrific script excellent story breathtaking effectsthe was truly marvelous,fantasy
no twists or difficult to follow plots this movie was easy watching from start to very end obviously the idea is used million times before evil declares war on world heroes try to stop them evil seems to be winning government decides to nuke the evil and sacrifice the heroes at the same time but in the end the heroes save the day but i dont think movies like this ever go old i am a 32 years old woman and felt like making a cape out of my sheets and go play superheroes after i saw this movie it was really funny at parts the whole theatre was laughing and the action bits werent overly long which usually make me go yawn all in all this movie is the best one i have seen in a long time and i am usually very critical about movies also i think i am in love with robert downie jr now,fantasy
there is something to think about when we think that we have had movies where the characters were already presented to us we walk in to the movie having knowledge of them their personality history etc this makes for a great time saved in engaging the audience and the impact is genius the opportunity to make a good movie was not squandered the is nothing less than the apex of mythologys evolution the movie does not waste a moment exposing the audience to intense scenes from the beginning the story is gripping the enemy loki chillingly relatable to in his human immaturity and the heroes are a beautiful diversity of awesome real humans are fighting next to the superheroes  effectively elevating black widow and hawkeye to the rank of what ancient civilizations would call gods the hulk is played perfectly and delivered intensely he was my favorite character though captain america was pretty much like jesus less the miracles plus the super abilities hes the strategist savior gallant gentleman hero thats really an inspiring for the rest of the team and even for the audience there are plenty of moments of comic relief suspense petty power hungry jealous gods are crushed by humans most impressive was how suddenness was perfectly conveyed on screen where movies like crouching tiger hidden dragon accomplished impressive feets with wires on actors to make them look like theyre flyingjumping tricks were employed to make everything look as real as possible at one point black widow jump kicks a man with both feet landing on his chest and she fell on her back the same way you would if you tried in real life when the hulk punches thor through the wall the timing of the impacts shockwave is perfect and it looks freakishly real its a small detail that makes all the difference the extra juice that makes the b grade an a of course the scenes of destruction were beyond impressive creative and awesome i hadnt been so astounded in a very long time not since die hard 4 i also loved all the technology they used their daring vision is an inspiration for what we would like to atteign if only in the display technology used by stark and banner the movie was inspiring i want to be a hero in my everyday way of being not that i am going to go and build an iron man suit though id die for one but the chivalry nobility and honor in being helpful considerate and empathic is very appealing i dont want director furys words of despair to be real for our world we need heroes but ah its an ancient notion do yourself a favor go watch the movie be inspired be entertained and maybe we  the new generation  can become the of earth and her inhabitants for all the brutal treatment she has undergone under our auspices before,fantasy
first thing first the is a masterpiece period its not easy to put together the most famous marvel superheroes apart from spidey of coursein a single movie with a good plot very good characters development good  evil and make a great movie like this one the story develops around the project an idea by nick fury director of shield and the superherobillionaire tony stark alias iron man a group of superpersons at service of mankind something like the xmen the villain here is loki returned from the end of the other great movie from marvel studios thor eager to take control of the earth using the powers of the tesseract the same powerful alien artifact seen in captain america there is a connection with other marvel movies in fact to really appreciate the movie you should see the other two movies at least but its not a priority of course the result is a movie full of wonderful action sequences smart dialogs excellent character development and an open finale for another possible great adventure dont worry no spoilers here just wait the end of the first part of the credits at the end of the movie a pleasant surprise a wonderful movie for every comic fan around the world and for the ones that hates this kind of movie just see this film and youll be amazed trust me 1010 teo from italy,fantasy

awesome awesome  awesome  its the kind of movie you always wait for incredible this movie in first takes some time for story building not much action neither a good screenplayfeels a bit slow but second half  its just way fast doesnt make a single scene where u can wait  thinkaction storyline superheroes villains  everything is huge enormous  watchable direction nice holds the story tight screenplay is cool all the heroes have given a good coverage though its all about hulk all others are overshadowed by hulk  whenever you see hulk on screen people go crazy whistles claps 3d surely not that effective you can watch it in 2d as well 3d is ok not good first part may make you bore to some extent nothing else my ratings 910,fantasy
 assemble a marvel studio film directed by joss whedon comic fans most anticipated film of the year the film slowly began gathering momentum since the incredible hulk staring edward norton was released back in 2008 slowly over the course of years the other films followed given the none comic book fan a look into some of the characters in the avenger team before they became part of the in order of release date hulk iron man capitan america these films were a pre sequel to assemble the character development in this films comes from their interaction together and them becoming a team the film follows the 6 superhuman characters known as iron man tony stark captain america steve rogers the hulk bruce banner black widow natasha romanoff  thor and hawkeye clint barton lead by the master of deception and secrets nick fury on a journey of self discovery and finding out what part or purpose they really have in been an avenger these heros are tasked with the burden of saving the world from alien annihilation and from the wicked grasp loki thor half brother the film seemed to stick to the original comics faithfully drawing the necessary and integral parts from the comic and inserting them on the big screen for example the helicarrier floating shield aircraft  like many action films of today cgi and special effects have become a household commodity it would have been easier to leave this comic book nugget out but through the use of realistic cgi and special effects whedon was able to incorporate this in a none shoddy way although the film heavily relied on special effects and green screen everything was appropriately placed the all star cast which had many in a pessimistic mood pulled through the actors gelled well which made their on screen chemistry believable as a result they were able to bring to life and capture the mindset of the character they were playing all the characters were given their chance to shine with such precision lost in many films of these calibre and actors yes the film had many clichd lines but the actors pulled them off without subjecting the audience through painful cheese moments does the film give you your moneys worth narrative action good special effects and yet stays faithful to the comic to answer that question you need to watch it yourself but as far as superhero films go this is one of the better ones in terms of entertainment and realism many people expect to see in an action fantasy film,fantasy
76 for noncomic book fanatics although there are plenty of fantastical elements in this movie this movie is an enjoyment although everyone who enjoys this movie will need to be willing to accept the fantastical elements of the characters and main plot points this movie is successful because it is logical and reasonable beyond those openly accepted fantastical characters the action is exciting imaginative and well shown but the greatest strength of the movie was the development of the characters we didnt need to know the comic book facts about the characters to understand what was happening moreover the characters had personality they were reasonably complex and interacted with enough pressure against each other to understand them as more than just cardboard comic book cutouts the highlight was the humoristic quips between the heroes i recommend that you see this in the cinema in the 3d version as the 3d is done well and not the overthetop 3d of yesteryears but see this with another person who enjoys fantastical stories,fantasy
a movie some four years in the making from the postcredit teaser of 2008s excellent iron man and 2010 sequel through last years equally impressive though very different thor and captain america movies the weight of expectation is often a tough one to bear with the question being could the bringing together of these stories and characters hope to equal the sum of the parts as a long time comic book fan i would have to say the answer is a resounding yes in fairness i did have good reason to hope  joss whedon is a long time marvel comics writer and his speciality is ensemble characters as with the highly successful buffy and angel franchises he has a talent for geling an aparrently incongruous group  exploring the conflicts between the characters with humour to bring them together even the relatively underdeveloped characters  mark ruffalo as the new banner  hulk jeremy renner as clint barton  hawkeye and scarlett johanssens black widow are fleshed out and given fair screen time each essential to the plot in their own way nick fury and his team of shield agents also play their part while tom hiddlestons return as the arrogant demigod loki provides ample threat with the feeling of something darker lurking in the wings  make sure you wait for the inevitable postcredit teaser for a clue as to what true the movie does rely heavily on superpowered set pieces from the clashes of egos and fists hammers shields and repulsors within the group to the incredible citywrecking finale but what else would you expect or hope from in a movie like this from the actionpacked setpieces and great oneliners through to the human interactions assembles all of the parts and proves the whole to be greater than the sum,fantasy
there is only a few films i have watched in theaters which while coming out compels me to run in again for the second time there was troy  there was the dark knight  there was inception and finally this is what superheroes movies should be doinggenerally i am a gentleman in theater halls  but by jove this movie just cracked me open and i remember clapping  shouting and whistling aptly helped by all other people sitting in the hall at every other second  okay chris nolan is genius  but welcome joss whedonsir i salute youjust watch it guys its worth your every penny if you have ever read comics and thought what would it be like to see it in a moviego watch this this movie was the best damn thing from hollywood in a while and that is said with due respect to amazing bunch of talent in hollyvill during the climax you might be reminded of the dark of the moon but mr michael bay please take a few classes from sir joss whedon in how to make an amazing 3d movie that delivers big timeenough said go buy the damn ticket and watch it while you canremember its 2012the end is comingha ha ha ha,fantasy
theres a belief nowadays that superhero movies need to be dark and grittylike the dark knight well the goes against the tide and comes out shining for marvels latest movie team up is nothing short of epic with the right balance of actionhelicarrier battle the thrilling nyc climax and humori still cant get the hulkloki confrontation out of my mind d all the actors are at their best the direction is deft and the story is solid my favourite were definitely the hulkthe way he hulks out during the climax is pretty awesome and hawkeyewho knew shooting arrows could look so cool every character gets his moment to shine which is a great job in a film with so many characters hats off its not like its flawless it feels sort of fluffy and also could have been longer but i guess thats me but all that takes a backseat as director joss whedon gives us the best film of the year so far all in all the is a must watch,fantasy

this was far from a bad film but it also wasnt quite a great film it has spectacular cgi is funny and each of the characters are well developed especially the hulk theres even a sad emotional moment at one point scar jo is actually quite cool and loki is a bad guy who you can both sympathise and despise at the same time i cant actually say anything is particularly bad except maybe the hawk ive nothing against the actor but his skills with the arrow seemed a bit out of place with the others he was like legolas without the blonde wig speaking of blondes you could tell the film was done by joss whedon as the dialogue was interspersed with quick one liners and the banter between the team was funny the best bit though was probably when no words were used at all between hulk and thor it must have been difficult to mesh all the characters together and give each of the stars enough screen time to keep them happy overall its not as good as the dark knight but its not meant to be as dark and serious as that the dark knight is a cartooncomic book character pretending to be a proper film star the has film stars pretending to be cartooncomic book characters and it never takes itself too seriously so is fun to watch,fantasy
so i went to the cinema intended to see the i was kinda worried about what would i see i was waiting and in the meantime i was thinking in every possible way that the movie would suck i was wrong the movie has great lines with a lot of humor stark talking with loki which was awesome and funny or when hulk smashed loki around after a small chat a lot of action which is delivered throughout the movie under certain circumstances and not randomly which would ruin it robert downey jr as tony stark was my favorite character in this movie just funny  awesome i also found the character development pretty good tony stark is a lot of different since the last movie as well as other characters and the story line was not cheesy or a bit lame like most of the action movies it had a solid story line not entirely based on action but on the dialog itselfoverall this movie is a must see for the fans of marvel and a great action movie for all the rest and bottom line the lines of tony stark were priceless do not forget to see it on 3d,fantasy
compared to captain america or iron man the quality of suspense heroism the definition of a soldier is not there in this moviethough the action element is incredible there is noticeable lack of spirittransformers or the rise of cobra or battle la or even jl movies exhibit a thrill which would make one to feel the battle of survival plot is very predictable and the lack of mystery makes it even worsefor those people who have watched similar team effort crisis control by a bunch of supers as in jl there is always an extra expectation should understand that in except for thor and loki the others are only highly skilled or enhanced human beings having said all this i still have given an 8 because it is still a marvel the visuals the combats and the policy of equal footing for all heroes made the movie worth its money,fantasy
this eagerly awaited epic blockbuster didnt disappoint in the slightest the big budget 220m movie directed by the relatively inexperienced director joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer and serenity incorporates the personal motives of every character in fighting a war that can only be won by the super powers that bethe film oozes coolness and the futuristic technology with leave the viewer smiling and connecting with each character the plot of the movie revolves very much around fantasy with aspects of scifi which works well to ensure the heros really are up against a challenge there were areas which could have been better explained with regard to the villainous characters and where the portal came from however with a running time of 144 minutes you can certainly understand why it wasnt the movie is rated 12a as it should be with no real violent scenes or swearing and a lot more humorous that initially expected a film made for an extremely diverse audience families groups of friends marvel readers and even couples good acting good effects good soundtrack great film,fantasy
two thumbs uplet me get this straightactingcharacters  it was good and brilliant especially mr starks gonna love to give him credit for making this film not just a scifi action but also showered some great humoreffects  this factor is widely visible joss whedon  co has a great vision unlike some transformers sound  visual effects this film has greater eye catcher storyplot  although the ending  climax scenes were as expected the whole story  scripts were made you think it is flawlessly made simply because the whole story is simple from the beginning of lokis plans of mayhem and assembling theoverall 8710it was entertaining avery well executed film you get a double of the price you paid for it was unbelievably amazing as good as the xmen first class maybe last year and may contend for the second best comic book movie of all time next to the dark knight in my opinion but we will see if tdkr of nolan can top what he did last 2008,fantasy
maybe your army will come maybe its too much for us but its all on you because if we cant protect the earth you can be damn sure well avenge italong with many others the was one of my most anticipated films of 2012 and i can honestly say that it didnt disappoint me one bit it was even better than what i had anticipated and every single person in the theater seemed to have had the time of their lives there were plenty of laugh out loud moments where everyone just cheered and the movie never ceased to entertain the is one of the best superhero movies ever made and i would say only the dark knight surpasses it although comparing these two movies isnt fair because this film is much lighter and self aware of its premise the directed by joss whedon who also wrote the screenplay is masterfully put together meshing the incredible special effects and action scenes with the beloved characters and perfect cast everyone is really great in this film and it entertains from the very beginning this is what a popcorn summer movie should be i was worried so much hype for this film couldve ruined the film for me but i was wrong all the hype only built the momentum for this great action comedy superhero flick ever since the first iron man came out these films iron man 2 thor captain america and the incredible hulk have been a sort of teaser trailer for this big movie those films helped build the characters and build the momentum for what we truly wanted to see the i assume this is how kids actually felt during the early 50s when they were expecting for the next marvel comic book issue to come out this film definitely captured that essence and magic thanks to such a magnificent team of cast and crew the movie opens with loki tom hiddleston attacking the shield agency directed by nick fury samuel l jackson in order to retrieve the cube which would enable him to open a portal to another universe and send an army to destroy earth loki is successful and manages to steal the cube and force hawkeye jeremy renner and dr selvig stellan skarsgard to join him by taking away their free will in order to stop loki nick fury decides its time to assemble the team of superheroes which he has kept a close eye on for several years he sends black widow scarlett johansson to get dr banner mark ruffalo and agent coulson clark gregg to call on tony stark robert downey jr fury decides its time to get captain america chris evans back into the action and thor chris hemsworth comes all the way from asgard to try to stop his villainous brother from destroying earth these superheroes are assembled together but arent ready to work as a team they have some issues at first and have to learn to work together if they want to stop the evil lokithe premise is pretty simple but what really makes the film work is the interaction between all these great characters this film could have relied so heavily on the special effects that it wouldve lost the magic of the great characters created by stan lee but fortunately it decides to focus more on them the tension they face working together is what really makes the movie work there are plenty of funny moments as we have these superheroes fighting and mouthing each other robert downey jr has showed us he can play the part to perfection but every actor in this film really had great scenes one of my greatest fears was that so many actors would not have enough screen time but somehow everyone manages to be in this film for quite a while even minor characters such as black widow and hawkeye get great exposure another thing i feared before the was that i thought loki was one of the weakest villains of all the marvel movies but he is really great and dark in this film he proved to be a great rival but without a doubt the best thing and most surprising for me was mark ruffalos performance as the hulk he really owned the movie and he had the best and funniest scenes in the entire film pairing him with downey jr was really the best thing the producers could have done hulk is perhaps the best character in this film and the one i was least expecting to enjoy everyone in the theater was truly satisfied with the film and especially with the incredible hulk he was amazing and so was the movie for that matter httpestebueno10blogspotcom,fantasy
i am a designer and a great comic book fansince my childhood i was drawing and reading comics when the movie opened in my country brazi was so excited to watch itit was like seeing kids on the garden playing all around and having fun because i remembered the time when i was drawing the hulk captain america iron man and many othersi had fun had everything good that you can get watching on the big screen its a great movie and an epic to rememberusa people you gonna love itassemble,fantasy
joss whedon really delivered with this movie there was more action and comedy than you can wish for wrapped in a superheromovie after 5 movies the superheroes from marvel finally assemble in this twoandahalfhourlongrollercoaster of fun all the actors do an amazing job in bringing their characters alive especially mark ruffalo as bruce banner does a great job robert downey junior has become his character by now tom hiddleston has grown as loki and the rest of the superheroes give solid performances only scarlett johansson could improve in the comedy department but it is partly the fault of the writers for giving her unfunny jokes johansson makes up for it in the action part though if you are a fan of superheromovies and probably even if you arent the is a recommendation for you,fantasy
in the last few marvel movies  iron man 1 and 2 the incredible hulk captain america and thor was an aftercredits scene which referred to this coming movie the small scenes which were just enough to wetten the appetite for the planned movie well the movie has arrived here in europe story is simple enough loki adopted brother of thor has his eyes set on conquering the world and subjugating its people  freedom is overrated according to loki in the first scene he manages to steal something from the very secret shield facility thats when nick fury assembles his dreamteam the earnest captain america the one and only tony stark aka iron man thor himself dr banner  the hulk played by a wonderful wonderful mark ruffalo whos just right for the role natasha romanov and after a short trip to the dark side hawkeye of course theres friction between these strong characters but in the end they work pretty good together the is everything i dreamed of and more its big on action no doubt about it it looks plain awesome its never boring the chemistry between the actors is obvious and at times the movie is very funny  the way the hulk fights loki had me almost wetting my pants its serious when it needs to beand when i left the movietheatre i had a big smile on my face that doesnt happen to me that often i think this movie is best enjoyed if youve seen at least some of the movies that preceded it most notably iron man and thor very highly recommended,fantasy
the is a film like no othernever have so many super heroes appeared on screen togetheroften it is the case where a film suffers because of a huge star castbut director joss whedeon has definitely done his homework and given each super hero a decent amount of screen time and build up  the action scenes are flawlessly executed and are easy on the eyes unlike some recent action flicks these daysthere are a few scenes in the movie that are insanely funny mostly involving tony stark and the hulkthe story is nothing newbut the fact that it is carried out in such a linear and smooth fashion  makes it an amazing watchloki aka thors brother returns as the villain and does a good job at being badnick fury is decentscarlett johansson looks sexy in black playing the character of the black widowonly this time she has more screen time than what she got in iron man 2jeremy renner is impressive as hawkeye after his last hit mi  ghost protocolin conclusion i think is the best action movie this year so far with mind blowing special effects and enough scenes to make you get out of you seat and applaud or maybe blow a whistle or twoit would be interesting to see if gi joe retaliation matches up to this when it releases in late june,fantasy

hulk was good iron man was good thor was good captain america was ok moviesbut the was awesome it had everything that you expect when different superheroes from different origins join forces believe me it was worth every penny whedon did a great job in bringing out all the heroes together but if you havent watched thor iron man captain america etc you will be puzzled throughout the movie but all in all it was really entertaining and funnyif you want to have a great time with your kids and family this is the film you would want to seei would give the film 9 out of 10,fantasy
before the film had even came out in cinemas i knew i would like it but when i saw it even i was just intrigued and astounded at literally how good this film actually was from the beginning of the movie you are pulled straight into the story and the action and it continuous throughout the movie the comedy sections pull in really well as they are not constant and most of the time you do not expect the comedy to occureach character within the movie brings something to the entire thing i felt for each character pulled into their whole situation i can easily say that this is probably the best or one of the best movies i have ever seen throughout my entire life the action was perfect the dialogue was compelling and original to be honest all in all the movie was just extraordinaryi recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great story action comedy and the occasional dramadefinitely a movie to see you will be amazed at just how good this movie is i know i sure was,fantasy
im a big fan of joss whedon since buffy days love firefly and serenity so when i heard he was directing an movie i started to have faith that it would be done right once again joss didnt disappointleaving aside the obvious opportunity for ridiculously good action sequences that an movie can have and this film has a lot it was important that whoever directed this captured the different personalities that make up the team and the way they clash joss has always been good at writing for his characters which is why here hes pretty much perfectly grabbed each heros personality the dialogue between them is great and believable and being the fan he has been of the since the 60s he has a good idea of their background and what drives and motivates each of them theres some great exchanges between them as they work out their differences and when we reach the climax and they finally come together and work as a team what a treatthe actors that have portrayed their characters in past films are now set you cant see anyone else playing the characters they play theyre all fantastic work brilliantly as an ensemble and the new addition  mark ruffalo as bannerhulk is a great choice bringing that air of a man whos come to terms with his plight and learned to be calm and relaxed but with the temper just brimming below the surface this is the best film featuring hulk to date and because hulk this time was based on ruffalos movements and not entirely cgi its the most realistic hulk weve received to date as wellid also like to mention here that joss is great at writing humour into his stories and this film isnt short of some truly laughoutloud moments anyone whos a fan of his work in the past will recognise his brand of humour in this filmto sum up anyone whos a fan of superhero movies will love this it has everything you couldve hoped for in an movie its great to see some of our beloved comic book heroes given their dues in some great movies lately such as nolans batman films and xmen first class and this film is up there with the best ill be looking forward to the sequel especially after the sequence during the creditshighly recommended,fantasy
luck was on our side to all marvels universe fans in mexico since the premiered this friday 0427 just one week previous to the us release yes the movie is great yes the acting is really good double yes on special effects especially the ones related to the great battle in the city now what would i personally did not grant a perfect review of this most anticipated reunion of this eclectic group of superheroesbecause i do personally believe it took the movie too long to separate the individual characters into the actual group of course this is a personal opinion and even it might be possible this is exactly how the screenplay was actually written but nevertheless if the hunger games has any potential contender of putting a fight on this still babyyear in movies the is the one movie that has what it takes to give a good onewhat can you expect from this movie tons of action of course some light background on each of the main players sure thing humor not as much as you could have and certainly the biggest laugh in the theater came from a scene of the least expected character trust me on this oneso all in all this is a great movie to watch the 2 hours just fly by and i exited the theater satisfied with director joss whedon job i almost agreed with another review stating that all main characters did have at least one big scene during the film yet part of the missing point of my rating is that in my mind iron mantony stark appearance during the film was somehow larger than the rest of the charactersi am not a connoisseur of the actual comic but it would dare to guess that the majority of the hard core fans of this history will be pleasedof course this is not oscar material but hey this type of movies harry potter batman superman etc is the reason we go to the movies to escape reality for some time and and root for the good guysand these assembly of actors portraying these superheroes did a wonderful joboh and maybe last but definitely not least samuel l jackson on his role of director nick fury is great and you can definitely tell there are more than a couple of sljs personal touches on his performance that become the cherry on this exquisite and enjoyable cake known as the,fantasy
amazing movie it lives up to its hype josh whedon has done an amazing job of blending from all the solo movies and giving us the perfect taste which stands for me as the one of the best movies of 2012 he ensured that he has a role for each of the character rather than focusing of few main characters only personally liked the character of iron man and hulk the best part is keeping humor hand to hand with the action scene which ensures perfect entertainment for the viewer special effects were breathtaking and execution was seamless apart of the storyline up all the actors lived up to the expectation must watch atleast of 23 times,fantasy
this really is a great superhero film outclassing all of the previous films except ironman i this is a superb ensemble piece where all the characters shine i have to say that mark ruffalo as bruce banner was a stroke of genius  as portrayed by ruffalo banner is mild humorous hurt and self effacing the hulk here gets his best outing yet as a flaw in the previous two movies was that the hulk was more likable than banner and you spent the whole time waiting for him to change this is not the case in the where bruce banner is just as entertaining and ruffalo portrays him as hurt but not dull or sullen as happened in the other movies he manages to hold his own even with rdj on screen no mean feat in the film the best of the scenes involve hulk and ironman but everyone plays vital roles and no one is superfluous although tony stark really does steal every scene and he finally gets to show just what ironman can do ironman gets his best action outing to date if only ironman ii could have been even a tad like this the script is witty coherent and just fun pepper potts returns to continue the awesome romance with ironman which really fits in perfectly with the film,fantasy
i suppose the question on your lips is any goodthe short answer is yesthe longer answer is fk me silly that film was awesomethe even longer answer isjoss whedon has created a witty entertaining superhero that more than capably juggles different characters and threads all together into an unsubtle but solid filmit helps if youve seen the previous marvel studio films in the franchise before seeing this i had personally seen iron man 1 and 2 captain america and thor although i had not seen the incredible hulk with edward norton and i had a good idea of the principal characters and what was going on there is the barest bones of backstory for each of the heroes but the majority of exposition is around the character of black widow scarlett johannson hawkeye jeremy renner and bruce bannerhulk mark ruffalospeaking of which mark ruffalo somehow steals the show as the hulk utterly removing the previously uninspiring film adaptations he is amazing in every way bruce banner gets some quality lines and mark ruffalo delivers in pretty much every way it is a lot more of a subtle performance than most of his fellow actors who are much more brazen brash and forwardrobert downey jr once again delivers as iron man a character that is as rich and as interesting two films down the line as he ever was he gets the best lines and even though it takes a little bit of time to introduce iron man compared to some of the other characters he sticks in the mind and has his own standouts moments alongside the rest of thecaptain america chris evans is also on top form as captain america a character i was initially concerned would not fit well into the dynamic of the group but his character fits really nicelyas a personal favourite it is always nice to see loki on the screen his little brother syndrome makes his a fascinating villain in thor and tom hiddleston absolutely proves he is brilliant as this twisted powerful trickster in loki once again marvel studios provide a villain that is as well fleshed out and as interesting as the heroes ive already mentioned josh whedons outlandish ability to fuse together so many characters into a film well when all the have assembled each character and their traits clash in arealistic way the selfless with the arrogant etc etc whilst the film does try extremely hard to have as many avenger on fights as possible and they are thrilling seeing them work together as a team is frankly fantastic again several stunning shots pan seamlessly from one character to the next cutting through the large amounts of chaotic action to deliver what you wanted to see superheroes beating on thingsanother key whedonish tm is the humour it is a pretty funny film too bootits 220 million budget went a long way too apart from the actors and the not inconsiderable sums of money they would have been paid the cgi is almost faultless it is awesome and always seems to make the events feel like a comic book again the standout being a very realistic physical hulk the best incarnation yet for sure its not without faultthe plot is nonsense the script is sometimes clunky and awkwardit is a long film although doesnt really feel like ithowever these are mere grains of sand on a beach of awesomnesswatch this film910 easy,fantasy
the very beginning of the movie is capable enough to build your interest and keeps you watching the movies has many relative terms from other movies of the marvel cinematic universe and people who havent seen captain americathe first avenger or thoror the incredible hulkor ironman might have to scratch their heads at timesbut that will not matter a lot because the movie will keep you laughing and will keep you in the moment never letting you get bored the movie is intense at many times thrilling a sometimes toobut the action and comedy is amazing especially the scene where loki is beaten up by hulk like a washermans clothes will keep you laughing even after hulk is finished up with his beating every time you start thinking that you are getting bored and start sliding on your seat something will happen in the movie and you will straighten up on your seat waiting for more the movie will keep on building a plot for action throughout its length and will blast your head with thrilling action scenes in the end the performance by every actor is respectable the dignity of each character is maintained none of the superheroes is portrayed miser than others even hawkeye and black widow gain audiences respect in the end in short the movie is a must watch and for the fans of any of the or the superheroes who are a part of it will commit a sin if they do not watch this movie,fantasy
to all you around the world getting pumped for this movie it is no let down prepare to be blown away by a director that has managed to perfectly set up so many characters playing different roles at the same time and in blissful harmony the plot line is very fluent there are no scenes where you questioned the characters etc i hope you all enjoy it as much as i did when it is released here is the blurb to keep you excited  nick fury is director of shield an international peace keeping agency the agency is a whos who of marvel super heroes with iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow when global security is threatened by loki and his cohorts nick fury and his team will need all their powers to save the world from disaster,fantasy
where to begin the is where multiple superheroes come together to go against one force from a fans point of view the movie hit the spot especially considering that there were references to events which occurred in comic books which were not previously filmed from my point of view a nonfanatic yet sucked into the hypei had the inclination to watch those movies which i hadnt watched yet with the superheroes in the and trust me it was worth it apart from the fact that a viewer would not know a particular superheros past there is a minute back story which is worth noting from the previous movies so as to feel at ease with the continuation of the story which is seen in thecasting was appropriate as most were from the previous films but even roles such as the one which cobie smulders some of you may know her as robin from how i met your mother played though small were significant screenplay cannot be argued and the fact that this movie had a usp of 3d motion picture the effect changed the experienceaction is dominant in this film but with numerous combinations of enemies as not all fights are against the bad guy in particular it is exciting as well as interesting with the question of not only who is going to win but how comedy interestingly was present i feel mainly because of robert downey jr but others were important factorsthis movie was not very dialogueheavy but more straight to the point scriptwise the dialogues were indeed effective as well as pulsating for the the viewerwith an approx 2hr 30min running time there are hardly any parts which one would find unnecessary and although it may appear as a onetimewatch there are particular scenes which really make you look for them on youtube and suchwith bursts of excitement at random intervals and sometimes loads of adrenaline in more than just a couple of scenes the took me by surprise and i hope it does the same to youps i saw the ranking being extremely high an 89 on imdb before viewing it and now i can see why it was so high,fantasy
its clear from the start that whedon wants to honour the opportunity to show us what superheroes can do we get to enjoy a classic comparison of real people in a world of super people the beats are perfect i found myself feeling hugely impressed at the skill set and technology of the shield operatives then completely sorry for them when they are thrust into the world of the the themselves were pitched at a power level far greater than set up in the preceding movies but they were only the better for it the speed of the impacts the level of catastrophic damage that they leave in their wake all perfect the only missed opportunity i felt was for captain america still too much of the poster boy soldier and not enough of the captain except when he is dealing with shield agents or policemen and i still wanted the captain to move more like bronski did in the hulk thor is definitely a god in this and the hulk is definitely a poorly guided atomic bomb iron man and banners intelligence was a blast to watch and the swagger of stark is nicely offset by moments of fear for the limitations of his tech i gripped my seat with the peril and i laughed out loudly along with the entire audience at the moments you will know when you do too i should have stayed in my seat for another viewing,fantasy
i saw the with no real knowledge of the comic book series or any of the characters beforehand however it took me only 10 minutes of reading imdb reviews to realise that the waters are clearly divided between fans and dark knight fans for me i was disappointed after seeing the however i can largely attribute that to my backgrounds in reading understanding and writing about complex ideas something christopher nolans films have drawn out of me with that said though the is a different kind of comic book film if youre looking for a fun action based movie for kids then the is for you however if you have desires for films with grand ideas deep characters and complex plots as well as the batman factor then the dark knight rises is definitely for you one thing is certain though you cannot compare both films against each other joss whedon uses the core elements of the comic series that brought out a very michael bay representation while chrisopher nolan transforms the comic book ideas into grander social commentaries on moral and philosophical issues while still giving the dark knight the attention it deserves i found the to be a typical clich heroes win predictable static film something which really takes the sting out of a film for me i sat through the film realising that the would come through and win by the way the film was constructed with the dark knight no one could have predicted the jokers complex schemes involving harvey dent and the way that batman still beat the joker yet lost the most in the end that is in my opinion where the falls short its use of poorly developed characters such as loki predictable story line and plot overuse of cg and clichs give it his rating sorry fans it might be hard to understand but trust me people who write bad reviews for the criticizing plot and story are well read and any movie needs a good and dynamic plot regardless of the genre,fantasy
the has been the trend for the past few days everybody had only good things to say about the movie and so i decided to watch it well it was not that good not for me at leastthe film is a visual extravaganza competing on the number of villains and visual graphics scene by scene if that is what you want from a movie then dont read the rest just go and watch the movie you wont be disappointedbut what the movie really lacks is a good solid storyline it is as if the director wanted the movie to feature this much of characters and they should all get the same amount of screen time let it be at the expense of the story that is the main issue with the movieupto the interval the movie just drags on the usual stuff with the villain trying to steal an energy source and the superhero team assembling to get it back there is another interesting thing here the villain actually tries to manipulate the team and let them fight each other and this goes on and on and on in the first half really absolutely boring with clichs all over no creativity of any sortin a superhero movie one thing we expect is the introduction of the superheroes well introduction there was no such thing they just walked on to the scene saying hi there no thrill no excitement  no sheer blood rushing through the veins sceneand some people were there for no reason at all i do not know what black widow and captain america did they just felt like minnows compared to the hulk and thor and cothe cast was good anyway well they are not doing their roles for the first time are they so no credit there to the team jeremie renner scarlet johansson and robert downey jr were superbafter the interval the movie gains some pace and it is all action this is where the movie becomes watchable actually i liked the second half of the movie action does not need story or dialogues does it may be that is why and last but not the least is that guy loki really a villain or a joker is that what a villain is never terrifying not even for a 2yearold and in the end spoiler alert hulk thrashes him and says puny god some villain hai am a big fan of superhero movies in my opinion the best superhero movie released recently was xmen first class compared to that this is absolute crap i would say these guys made a movie which is to be their masterpiece to which they put their money and effort limitlessly and it came out disfigured like this wow,fantasy
folksin case youre interested in the new movie dont waste your time or money unlike the first installment this has nothing but special effects with a disjointed storyline there are explosions in which most caught in the blast radius would get killed but leaves nothing but scratches and little or no blood its almost stupid with lines that are supposed to be funny but are just fillins for lack of meaningful dialog however the kids in the audience laughed a lot which made me realize how out of place i was and need to grow up there will be no next time if there is yet another sequel yuck how disappointing,fantasy
the is simply the epitome of how bad marvel and hollywood have become in the past decade if you combine terrible acting chris hemsworth as an example shocking greenscreen and a massive clump of fanboy superheroes with hollywood eyecandy you get the joss wheadons career is now over whether you marvel fanboys like it or not the storyline is so poorly constructed that it lets you instead gaze in wonder at a clich alien invasion a clich bad guy and a clich wonder device tesseract i can say no more get over it fanboys a mass of your favourite superheroes in one movie does not warrant an 82 rating i hope you guys enjoy the sequel cause im not wasting my money on such garbage,fantasy
a terrible movie from start to finish the actors are wooden the action is basically just hand to hand combat with limited relevance to their super powers captain america looks like he is embarrassed to be part of it the hulk cant control his furythen he can then he cant then he can and so on there is no real explanation of the relationship between thor and his brother nor is there any real tension in the end i was left not caring whether the good guys won or lost oh and iron man who is usually quite fun and funny was a total bore with his inane onelinersonly mark ruffalo as the professor was any good he always seems to shine in any movie,fantasy
not something special it really can have be seen this movie costs a lot but its kind of boring one and it has a long duration,fantasy
efects are great how marvel make those efects robert downy jrs tony starkiron man has person and is funny character but chris evanss captain america lost his soul and person he not feel leader same words with black widow,fantasy
ive been struggling for a while now with superhero movies im really into fantasy and science fiction and most of my friends like superhero movies this supposedly being the ultimate superhero movie i gave it a gothere are some good things to be said for the the special effects are quite decent there are some funny moments and actors like johanson and hiddleston do an awesome jobhowever i simply cant fathom how people can so tremendously and even zealously enjoy a movie without a story in effect what this movie does is tie together a couple of superheroes introduce a threat to earth and spin that around for 25 hours into some unnecessarily long action sequences and dont even get me started on all the major plot holes it is a shame that for all the money that goes into a big production like this it seems they didnt spare any to hire some halfdecent writers,fantasy
ive noticed that most of these superheroes battling supervillain films get very high viewer scores on imdb80 or above clearly many people love this kind of movie i dont my thoughtsi saw this on a plane several years ago ive seen several others in the genre in this filmthey all seem to be like thisthe heroes are battling to save the world sometimes they battle to save the galaxy or even the universe in this film the plot setup is so ridiculous i cant take any of it even halfway seriously but the genre fans are pleased because it delivers the one supreme thing they care most about beings with superpowers fighting each other much of this very overlong movie consists of characters battling flying around running around more fighting etc etc my reaction giant yawn what a bore see before these kinds of moviessay before star wars as a point of referencemost movies were not focused on battle scenes explosions fate of worlds etc they were about characters and human not alien etc beings action scenes even in action films did not take up most of the screen time now there have been so many of these films they all seem alike its way beyond saturation so if you are entertained by lots of fighting using special effects you may well like this otherwise dont waste your time,fantasy
no one will probably read this butthe is pretty mediocre i adore a lot of the other mcu films but for me this one just feels empty while watching this i literally felt no emotion at all i dont know why i feel like if you remove the hype its just a generic action movie so sorry marvel fans but this gets a 510 from me,fantasy
endless fights mass destruction of property mass robot villains and shallow characters a waste of time,fantasy
comic con is not for us like yoga or postures cannot be for them running the circle of existence with words like but and if are the crew of this comic book scott mcloud wrote comics in his basement and broke an ink pot on the wall to see the pattern of the i from psychoanalysis which jacques lacan has to get from us because cartoonist cannot be a walt,fantasy
this movie makes any superhero nerd shake with excitement to see your childhood memories come to life is great the cgi is pretty good there are some very funny moments in the film most of which comes from robert downey jr whenever there is action you can clearly tell whats happening and you can really enjoy it then when the final battle happens and ends it made me just feel good you see six heroes just work together and it just pleases you the two after credits scenes are also enjoyable with joss whedon setting up thanos years from 2012 and the shwarma scene which is just funny it is my third favorite marvel movie behind guardians of the galaxy and infinity war,fantasy
this movie is corny and most of the dialogue is weird but the movie doesnt feel different the dialogue im talking about doesnt pull you out of a scene seriously everyone and their mom saw this including me and my mom seriously only this movie can pull this off and the chemistry between these alisters should be illegal,fantasy
i remember distinctly this movie coming out back in the day it was big i was collecting the lego sets like crazy i was listening to the theme tune over and over again my brother complaining about his total dislike towards captain america for no good reasonthe only thing that i think could have been better is to not have joss whedon write the screenplay as some of the ways hes writing really dont sit with me very well cap in this is completely unlike how he was in first avenger and his oldfashioned ways even though its not a bad thing really took me out of the film at timesbut now that weve had his sequels and his excellent inclusion in infinity war im so glad that the russo brothers made him a better character in those in this he wasnt really compelling he was just kind of there to tell people that im the good guy herebut nevertheless this paved the way for the mcu to keep expanding and to really connect to these characters even more with the sequels and spinoffs i just wish that joss whedon wasnt too in control if the russos wrote most of caps stuff then it would have been even more of a masterpiece,fantasy
this movie isnt a 910 or 1010 nor is it a 510 or anywhere below thatyes its really formulaic but i think what makes this movie so good is the charactersthe dialogue is pretty good i like the dialogue between bruce banner and agent romanoff in the beginning it was pretty tense and i think is one of the best scenes in the moviethe having arguing with each other is really good especially the one where loki was in prison and the reason the dialogue is so good is because these characters are very different from each other and them arguing is very interesting cause you get see their opinion on different subjects and their motives and morals and thats really good when it comes to character one thing that justice league never managed to succeed onthe villain is ehloki is much better than any other villain in the marvel cinematic universe and he was pretty fun to watch on screeni have nothing really big to say when it comes to the action scenes they where fine i like how the teamed up when they fought lokigood moviegood characters weak storyif you havent watched it go do it know cause i think you will have fun watching it,fantasy
the grandeur of the spectacle and the fantastic special effects are worth it alone this film is excellent in every way it does take a while to get going but the characters and story work well together and it manages to balance the egos humour action and human aspects of it excellently,fantasy
tone script  story loki gets control of tisseract he wants to bring doom of humanity by opening a portal to chitauri army with the help of tisseract superheroes must now assemble to fight this threat against planet earthit is the first movie where the assemble thus being one of the reasons why it appeals the storyline here is not complicated and easy to swallow if you see marvel universe movies in order  it would be nice even if not watching all of them watching a few do it in ordermy favorite scene is where hulk beats loki and refers to him as puny god it never gets olddirection screenplay cinematography justified music justified acting justifiedfinal verdict it is a nice onset where assemble watch it in order to appoint disappointment,fantasy
ill keep this short i really enjoyed this upon release at the cinema and did again 6 years later great marvel movie bringing the preceding mcu movies all together as one,fantasy
the idea of sequel to what were essentially four different series and bringing four major comicbook characters to the screen in the same film shouldnt have worked but it does assemble isnt just a good film but a great one that actually surpasses all mcu films that came before it all of the characters are welldeveloped and share equal importance to the actionpacked story its this key focus on character that really sets the film apart the story itself is pretty generic but its the way in which the characters interact throughout the film that give it a personality all of the cast are great the score by alan silvestri is epic and the script is full of witty dialogue that elevates the entertaining action sequences the film isnt perfect however due to the overtheatrical but well performed villain the dissonance between the audience and the army of cgi aliens and the rushed conclusion 810,fantasy
the only threat of the villains is loki who could be handled easily by banner or thor singlehandedly barton and banner were mindcontrolled by loki but that was just temporary loki just started a war that he would never win the storytelling is highly unbalanced the visual effects and action sequences of the last fourty minutes were sensational and thrilling yet the long part before it was boring and useless some action scenes lack credibility and look fake as nobody gets injured or bleeds and the editing of the film is not convincing the name is misleading since these superheroes are not avenging and are just saving the world particularly the war criminal loki was not sentenced to death savers might be a better name for the teamoverall this film does not live up to its hype,fantasy
this movie knows exactly what it wants to be  a highoctane not too serious comic book movie it has amazing action visuals and great humor all the characters have distinctive personalities and looks and also more or less equal amount of screen time and great momentslines interaction between characters is spot on and its obvious the cast is having fun with their roles the plot is perfect for the first time these characters all work together and the villain is also almost too memorable marvelous movie ,fantasy
a film that exceeds expectations the opened our eyes to the possiblities of the shared universe by giving us one of the best if not the best superhero film ever made by putting emphasis on characters action visuals and great interactions,fantasy
the is popcorn entertainment at its best its a superhero movie and its not ashamed to show off that baggage at all if anything the takes that label and runs with it all the way through its savingtheworld storydoes it need to be particularly deep no is it an entertaining film that managed to get on by just fine before spidermans introduction to the mcu yes absolutely cap thor hulk ironman black widow and nick fury are great team players overall i didnt count hawkeye then because for some reason jeremy renners portrayal just doesnt work for me everyone else is just fine though may be rendered a little obsolete because of its sequels but i reckon its still a rocksolid movie thats a great timekiller through and through,fantasy
marvel never seemed to dissapoint but this time they went far ahead of them and created maybe their best movie ever the feeling you get when you see 56 action heroes all doing crazy good stuff and helping each other in some fun and interesting ways tactics and fights is bigger entertainment than anything else a movie can give the dialog between them the way they hate and admire each other at the sime time their personalities and powers all mixed together in one big superhero gem that offers everything that is possible to offer not to mention the work that was obviously put in visual effects and design the villain is everything he is the driving force and gives maybe an oscar worthy villain performance,fantasy
theres a sense of infancy and an accompanying intimacy despite the large scale ending because assemble 2012 is for all intents and purposes so retrospectively small and yet actually so big it represents a keen unprecedented challenge for writerdirector joss whedon and it was a surprise success to the delight of many a fan and studiohead across the globe the fact it pulls off a six character crossover without a clear protagonist ill add is impressive and slightly concerning its also consistently entertaining and fastpaced packing in all the action and spectacle youd expect along with the quick character moments that make it stand out theres the occasionally hammy line or ever so slightly cheesy moment actually evocative of whedons style thats only more amplified by the distance afforded by time and the fact that this flick wasnt what the mcu now is nor was it what the mcu then was as it represented a shift in the universe that was then shifted again rather quickly these inconsistencies of tone and character both past and prophetic future arent major issues and are often marked by moments of clairvoyant clarity or otherwise pitch perfection pertaining to comicbook character personas and as such the relatively plotless piece is still a delight to behold its smashybashy finale is also especially wellrealised though showing its age now and feels like a tangible sequence rather than a series of greenscreen sets connected by digital extensions it isnt the best marvel film but it represented a big leap for the studio and the genre as a whole and is an enjoyable ride throughout 810,fantasy
i was truly disappointed considering the buildup heading into this movie when i first saw nick fury towards the end of iron man about this initiative i was eagerly excited for it but i knew it wont be for at least another four years before the movie actually comes out all that waiting felt like it was just a waste of time nothing much happens in the the only good thing was to see all the superheroes gather together for the first time loki was fine as the villain and hes one of the main foes of the anyway in fact hes the reason why the were brought together in the first place some consider him to be the true menace to the team but it is funny that loki is thors main enemy yet hes also happens to be one of the greatest foes which really makes no sense id say that because the consists of several superheroes such as iron man captain america and the incredible hulk yet they still find loki a challenging opponent this is one of the few things that doesnt make sense within the marvel universe but i did like the postcredit scene but that again reminds me of the one in iron man,fantasy
plot  the structure of this movie is a bit strange i havent really seen any movies structured quite like this its not bad necessarily and i dont see any other way to structure a movie like this but its still a bit odd the odd story structure in this movie doesnt take away from any of the entertainment but i just wanted to point it out characters  all of the characters and the acting is great in this movie sights and sounds  the cinematography in this movie is great so is the sound design the effects are also great everything in this movie is very well done overall this movie is very entertaining the action is wellchoreographed the comedy is good the character arcs are interesting i have no complaints for this movie it is very entertaining id recommend it,fantasy
as lover of action adventure and the marvel comic books this movie was amazing it was really fastpaced and it had action while maintaining a good story line throughout the comic books were great and this movie lives up to that standard overall great movie i really liked it,fantasy
i expected the worst for this movie i really didi expected just a bunch of special effects and no storyi was pleasantly surprised that this movie is actually very very good and yes i was right about the special effects but this movie does have a heart and a story i liked the way they brought all of the characters together i even liked the soundtracki highly recommend this movie i think it ranks as perhaps the best comic book superhero movie ever made and ive seen them all i used to think that the 1978 supermanthe movie and 1981 superman ii couldnt be surpassed in 2002 the first spiderman movie came close to being as good as the first two superman movies but i still believed the superman movies still tops until this movie this is the comic book movie that finally dethroned the first two superman movies in my humble opinion yes i think it is that good,fantasy
ive always been a fan of superheroes hulk being my all time favorite this movie made my life long reading of comic books come to life it has a few laughs lots of action even a little romance this movie has it all after coming out of the imax screening i was talking about this movie for months and even years later im excited to see whats next for the franchise marvel hasnt let me down thank you for making my child hood dreams a reality,fantasy
it has all come to this can a movie starring several grandiose superheroes be good not only to comic book fans but to the entire world and they got one of the greatest filmmakers for nerds ever joss whedon it is very clear in this movie that it is whedonesque especially in its dialogue and jokesit all comes down to how the team gets together and the chemistry among the team is immaculate everybody on the team work well together no matter what pairing it is hulk and iron man black widow and cap thor and hulk cap and iron man notice that one name is missing here and that is hawkeye he was basically a zombie follower of loki for half the film hawkeye in the final act is better but even jeremy renner knew that he wanted a better storyline still though the entire team of had incredible chemistrythe villain loki was a great choice for the to take on he is a formidable villain as a trickster god with an alien army sure aliens were a bunch of alien clones but they did prove to be a good matchup against thelets talk about the final battle it takes place in new york which is great because that is one of the benefits marvel has over dc they take place it cities that we actually live in sure it is fictional but they still went by several places that people have actually been to it was amazing to see the team fight either in tandem or by themselves for 20ish action packed minutes that doesnt mean i dont have complaints about the film as i mentioned before it bothered me how hawkeye was used although he did get a chance in the end to make his mark caps costume looked for like a onesie and not something you would expect a war hero and super soldier to wear the army might have been cgi at the end so it was just mindless action and oneliners but when it is done this well you cant really complainthis is a pioneering and spectacular film in its right it took something that nobody thought could work a blockbuster film starring at least 4 larger than life characters that have only had their own movie and made a great movie cast chemistry  whedon writing and directing  loki  third act battle  really small things use of hawkeye for some of the movie caps suit cgi armyfinal score 9510,fantasy
im not a traditional comic turned into movie watcher i do have a tendency to watch those films that seem to catch my attention in the trailers are recommended by friends like the or have high ratings not being a superhero comic film devotee for a superhero movie to work for me has to be basically entertaining engaging and fun and if possible to have a good combination of at least a few of the following elements  good script  great action scenes  fantastic production  good actors  good acting  great sense of humor  a great music score this movie ticked off a good deal of this boxes and that happened mostly in the final hour of the film the good  the production of the is top notch great settings suits spaceship design and alien images  the last half of the movie is what i expect from a superhero action movie to be and it has a great tempo awesome action scenes spectacular fights and alien creatures and is fullon fun and engaging  jackson hiddlestone and evans are good in their performances but i personally liked the freshness and natural acting of paltrow and gregg in their very secondary supporting roles i love seeing kickass female characters and johannson seems really fit for that sort of roles and she nails her character in that supertight suit  some of the dialogues and scenes were witty the bad  painful tempo and too long i felt bored to the core during the first half of the movie which goes for over an hour with boring pretentious dialogues not much happening and scenes that dont add anything to the film i stopped the dvd frequently because i was struggling to keep my attention focused  hemsworth was a pain to watch when he had to deliver his lines no matter how hot and downey jr always plays the same role no matter his character something i find very annoying  thor had a quite heavy australian accent but his brother in the film loki had a very british accent although of course they are from planet whatever shouldnt they have had at least a neutral unified accent  the film is set in a sort of near future with flying ships and very developed technology but we see the police and some of the characters using simple shotguns this incongruity rests credibility to the settings of the filmthe lol the only thing i found hilarious in the film is ruffalos transformation into hulk and some of the scenes related to the hulk seeing the hulk with ruffalos face was like seeing hulk with micky mouses face ruffalo has very sweet facial features seems to be a very sweet guy and usually plays tranquil man roles this was a fluffy huggable hulk i was really lol the dialogue between him and the old man when he falls into a warehouse are hilarious but that was intended overall if you are fan of superhero comic books and films you are going to enjoy and love this film no matter what i say thats great and totally respectable if you are a lover of good films no matter the subject this film is entertaining overall has a great second half but you will struggle to get there without feeling uninterested due to the unfocused direction the poor dialogues and the extralong unnecessary footageif you overcome the first half congratulations you have made it to the red carpet of action galore,fantasy

rd jr is always good and sarcastically funny scarlett is always yummy and has all the moves hiddleston as loki is great i like that character then when banner pounds the puss out of him into the floor 3x and punches thor across the room they were funny the hulk character has the potential for lots of funny bits the evil dudes from the farside however fail to come off as even being interesting a more human like enemy would have been better i thinki am danieli am sam sam i amthat samiam that samiam i do not like that samiamdo you like green eggs and hami do not like them samiam i do not like green eggs and hamwould you like them here or therei would not like them here or there i would not like them anywhere i do not like green eggs and ham i do not like them samiamwould you like them in a house would you like them with a mousei do not like them in a house i do not like them with a mouse i do not like them here or there i do not like them anywhere i do not like green eggs and ham i do not like them samiamwould you eat them in a box would you eat them with a foxnot in a box not with a fox not in a house not with a mouse i would not eat them here or there i would not eat them anywhere i would not eat green eggs and ham i do not like them samiamwould you could you in a car eat them eat them here they arei would not could not in a caryou may like them you will see you may like them in a treei would not could not in a tree not in a car you let me be i do not like them in a box i do not like them with a fox i do not like them in a house i do mot like them with a mouse i do not like them here or there i do not like them anywhere i do not like green eggs and ham i do not like them samiama train a train a train a train could you would you on a trainnot on a train not in a tree not in a car sam let me be i would not could not in a box i could not would not with a fox i will not eat them with a mouse i will not eat them in a house i will not eat them here or there i will not eat them anywhere i do not like them samiamsay in the dark here in the dark would you could you in the darki would not could not in the darkwould you could you in the raini would not could not in the rain not in the dark not on a train not in a car not in a tree i do not like them sam you see not in a house not in a box not with a mouse not with a fox i will not eat them here or there i do not like them anywhereyou do not like green eggs and hami do not like them samiamcould you would you with a goati would not could not with a goatwould you could you on a boati could not would not on a boat i will not will not with a goat i will not eat them in the rain i will not eat them on a train not in the dark not in a tree not in a car you let me be i do not like them in a box i do not like them with a fox i will not eat them in a house i do not like them with a mouse i do not like them here or there i do not like them anywherei do not like green egss and hami do not like them samiamyou do not like them so you say try them try them and you may try them and you may i saysam if you will let me be i will try them you will seesay i like green eggs and ham i do i like them samiam and i would eat them in a boat and i would eat them with a goat and i will eat them in the rain and in the dark and on a train and in a car and in a tree they are so goodm so goodm you seeso i will eat them in a box and i will eat them with a fox and i will eat them in a house and i will eat them with a mouse and i will eat them here and there say i will eat them anhywherei do so like green eggs and ham thank you thank you samiam songwriters flaherty stephen charlesahrens lynngeisel theo seuss pka dr seuss green eggs and ham lyrics  warnerchappell music inc,fantasy
its quite laughable that people are saying this is better than dark knight because in reality its nowhere near as good thats not to say the movie isnt entertaining because it is its just not the epic imdbs other reviewers would have you believe the movie has its share of problemsthe goodi thought hulk was finally done right in movies and mark ruffalo i thought did an excellent job as bruce banner the thanos spoiler at the end makes me extremely pumped to see the sequel tom hiddleston was a very good loki everyone fit their role quite well with one exception the action scenes were stellar in terms of cgi and choreographythe bad1 there was really zero point to scarlett johansson aside from providing the male fans with some ta they tried to introduce this dynamic between her and hawkeye but it ended up going absolutely nowhere 2joss whedon in the comics tends to write very campy dialogue as a result this movie came off as more of a comedy than anything i can deal with comedy and some of it in this movie was very well done i loved loki and thors conversation on the cliff then iron man tackles thor and loki speaks to the empty spot and says you were saying that was excellent however almost every damn word out of tony starks mouth was a joke or one liner he was basically comedy relief i know that tony stark is like that in the comics but he can be very serious as well tony was serious for about 2 minutes after coulson died and then went right back to the jokes i think whedon placed way too much an emphasis on comedy 3 as a result of this comedy there was almost no character development i see other reviews mentioning this incredible emotion and depth they are deceiving youthere was none of either no one grew or changed its a classic good vs evil story where good eventually triumphs with no underlying messages or tones thats all the movie really needed to be but others are giving the movie traits that it doesnt have 4 i really hated that they kept calling the cosmic cube the tesserack or however its spelled its the cosmic cubevery simple no need to change it why did they i havent a clue but it was dumb5 general plot problem 1 in lord of the rings when the urukhai killed boromir from then on you took the enemy seriously theyd just killed one of the greatest warriors in middle earth the greatest in gondor and broken the fellowship hence in the two towers when an army of them marched on helms deep you really wanted to see what happened because man was defending against an army of credible foes in the it really takes away from the movie when the giant army loki has been talking about and building up to finally shows up and are promptly decimated like they were gnats at a bug zapper they were literally there to get slaughtered with ease and provide a big cgi fight scene as a result there was no emotional investment in the final fight because the big enemies were a joke 6 general plot problem 2 in thor thor beat loki by himself pretty much now comes the and theyre fighting the evil loki again why exactly do we want to see this loki lost to thor in the movie last yeargood has triumphed over evil the story has concluded now were getting it rehashed but one side has 5 more members when weve already seen the main villain lose to one of the heroes before it takes a lot away from the movie whats the point of doing it again 7 general plot problem 3 the plot itself was very routine yet they somehow managed to garble it with twists that went nowhere loki deliberately got himself caught to occupy the while hawkeye under mind control stole some stuff loki needed then they introduced the whole idea that banner might be subconsciously under lokis control which amounted to nothing then hawkeye has to bust loki out of the shield helicarrier when loki has been shown to have the ability to teleport at will through solid matter then theres the whole sub plot of a free energy stark tower which becomes the focal point for the final battle while loki opens up a portal to bring his army in using the free energy yet they already established that the cosmic cube provides unlimited power itself in which case this also amounts to nothing shield is found out to be planning to use the cube to make wmds and its a big secret that the are shocked at yet fury makes one mention of the initiative plan and the wmds are promptly forgotten coulsons death was really a plot device so fury could smear some blood on his captain america collector cards stashed in his locker and give the a kick start to go fight then theres the whole thing about going out for shwarma that was really pointless and contributed nothing hawkeye and black widow also went nowhere as previously mentionedoverall the 87 rating this movie has makes it extremely overrated i suspect its people just being dazzled by cgi and seeing childhood comic heroes come to life on the big screen that makes them ignore the problems the movie has they didnt let george lucas get away with star wars episodes 13 and yet this is generally the same thing i wonder whythis movie is really a 610 but im feeling generous and gave it 7 its fun to watch and i was entertained but it really doesnt deserve the high rating it has,fantasy
as many i have been waiting for this film since ages as i was quite fond of all the previous avenger movies i obviously had great expectations some were fulfilled and some were not the movie started quite thrilling bringing in the chitauri was brilliant i kinda wish they would have got a bigger part in the story than just being the badass alien army to defeat but of course as the film had so many things to expand it would have been a little bit too much and that was quite the bad point in the movie even though i was expecting it to happen with so many main characters and with all their background stories there was not enough time to unfold everything that was behind the story by that i mean some of the characters were not even near as complex as in the previous movies for example i think thor turned out to be pretty onesided in this film i really liked the movie thor and while it was obvious that most characters were not going to be in this one i still missed hopkins portman and dennings mostly because the character of thor was more like the angry prince like in the beginning of the movie thor rather than the wise king he had became in the end of it another problem the amount of characters brought up was that the movie was a bit too fast unlike the calmer nature of the original films in this one there was always something happening mostly fight scenes i love fight scenes and usually enjoy them to the most but only with a fine balance of them and calmer moments of course in short terms it was very amazing and exciting but when it came to the death scene of coulson as fury sat next to him in silence had i only realized how tired one can get of seeing almost nothing but battles for an entire movie yet as ive said before with so many characters making this film calmer would have been simply impossible the acting otherwise was really nice the crew seemed to do their best during the whole film smulders was a pleasant surprise she was truly marvelous in the role of agent hill ruffalo was just as well a good exchange of norton he made the character of bruce banner very likable the scores also did catch up to the spirit of the film pretty well the music kept you in the mood during the whole time as for the amazing sides of the film the visuals were utterly cuttingedge 3d effects were not that outstanding though guess it still does not really worth the headache for a sequel as i hope one will happen in the near future i just hope that they will have more space and time to expand the characters personalities a bit more precisely as for the first film to merge all these stories i dont think they could have done any better maybe not the best directing nor the best superhero movie of all time but for sure is a fun film to watch with many great moments and good acting a mustsee for all marvel fans,fantasy
ive yet to see a movie based on a comic book character that deserves more than 1 or 2 starsthis one is beyond belief good cgi thats true but the film is an endless succession of clichsscarlett will look back in a few years and be ashamed of being in such a film some of the action scenes seem to have been thought by a 5 year old the terrible villain uses some sort of super energy to turn good people into bad people but a knock on the head just brings them back how simple how convenientsee it if you can handle 2 and a half hours of predictable senseless and bad entertainment time much better spent on a good walk on the park imdb 82 you gotta be kidding,fantasy
uninspired high gloss kiddie comic adaption with acceptable visual effects and a screenplay that fits on one sheet of toilet paperit is almost incredible how this movie could be so highly rated must be indebted by the target group which exists from nerd comicfans and teenagers without an clue what makes a good moviethe characters are flat and as a result none of the normaly good actors is capable of convincingwhats left is the typical actionloaded special effects spectacle but even in this category nothing is extraordinary or surprisinglets hope that someone saves us from a sequel is hard to underbid that,fantasy
i cant believe that this film got more than 610 rating  to even see 8810 is utterly ridiculous the story line is just cut and paste scenes  the villain is weakok now pause a minute  add all of the above to a bunch of funny clips that we all watch in the extras in the dvd version but instead these clips are placed in the middle of intense actionin the mood to fight battle scenes that will completely drop your focus i mean just when you are starting to like the film and get into the mood and into the story you get interrupted by some stupid i guess funny clip that we could have avoidedother than that if you watched transformers you are not missing anything just some blow ups that you loose count of at the end of the film,fantasy
there are many movies that are hotly anticipated and theres a huge buzz on twitter for months before they are released usually i go to watch them with some trepidationlike in the case of inceptionbecause i dont expect them to live up to the hype that wasnt the case with the i went in fully expecting to love the movie i didnt for the most partthe plottheres perhaps no better way to describe my disappointment with it than to say that even though the whole movie revolved around an object called the tasseract by the time it was done i had no idea what it was its surprising how a movie with so many characters and so little time for character and plot development still managed to squander the minutesany book or movie has a basic plot which has only a handful of major variations and you go in expecting to see a particular writers take on that basic premise you expect them to build on it and give it an elaborate new shapein the however the basic plot is all you geta team of heroes are initially uncooperative with each other they fail against the villain regroup and then beat him in a final showdown what little attempts the makes to dress that plot are so utterly reliant on other movies that have come before that to someone who hasnt seen them it makes no sense whatsoeverthe assumes that you have watched the iron man movies thor captain america and the incredible hulk before you set foot in the theater and does not feel the need to explain so many of the incomprehensible things that happen on the screen a lot of people disagree with me on this point but i think it is nonsensical to expect me to watch five movies before i sit down to watch one its the responsibility of the scriptwriter to make sure that the movie stands on its ownthe heroesmark ruffalo in the role of bruce banner was fantastic in this movie and i think the funniest character overall tony stark had the best punchlines but banners humor was more nuanced in my opinion but he did not get nearly as much screen time as he deserved id like to see that guy get a hulk movie of his owncaptain america on the other hand who was damn near useless in a war that involved hordes of flying drones was a constant presence in the movie the utter americanness of captain america makes me very indifferent towards the character and i thought the movie wouldve been better without himsame goes for the black widow who had little to do during the final battle hawkeyes storyline in the movie made no sense either and samuel jackson just did not work as nick fury he wasnt aggressive enough for the partmy favorite character is iron man but he was a shadow of what he was in his own movies hes supposed to be the funniest of the bunch but i could not really appreciate the punchlineheavy dialog he spouted i think hes more genuinely funny in the iron man movies and in fact id love to see jov favreau direct the 2 still after the hulk iron man was pretty much the only avenger who had a significant role to play in the proceedingsthe villainas for the villain loki the less said the better he was an embarrassingly underpowered villain and didnt seem imposing for a second take away the drones which themselves werent very threatening and hes almost impotent he got blasted with a gunlike thing from a man in a suit for crying out loud watching the final battle it was clear that iron man could have taken on him alonesix superheroes was beyond overkill to counter this guymiscellaneous complaintsi also took issue with the fact that ordinary humans had no role to play in this movie there are only two scenes in which they even have a speaking part and theyre both used for comic effect and one of them is also used to try to justify captain americas presence in this movie and are inconsequential it makes you feel detached from the movie the action might be happening on mars for all anyone caresthe people who liked the movie which is nearly everyone who saw it are saying that the action was awesome and thats all anyone really wanted from this movie maybe you did but that doesnt work for me while the action at the end is of an epic scale that is rarely matched even in hollywood the dialog and plot are far more essential for methe actionill say this about the action though it was involving in plenty of movies epic battle scenes are filmed in such a way that you feel like you are watching the action from the outside its a jumbled mess of explosions and flying debris in the despite its six heroes and an army of flying drones you could see the individual participants and feel like you were in the middle of the action it was very satisfying particularly in 3dconclusionwhen you watch truly horrible movies you exit the theater hoping that they never make a sequel or at least resolving that you wont watch it if it were to be made but thats not the case here the potential for a great movie is clearly there and i am glad that there will be a sequel to this moviei just hope someone does a better job of making it a story is about more than just its climax,fantasy
since when thor the great the hammerwielding god who is associated with thunder lightning storms and massive strength the protector of mankindtakes orders from one little snot capten americaand follows that orderssince when capten america is above allsince when we must see all that crap for raising up the american backboneenoughgod of thunder the vickings god  from the german mythology canot kneel down to capten americaalso since when capten america is above hulk and iron man loki and thor ohhhh now i see itbecause he has the american flag at his chestand loki how can he loose from capten america loki is a godso it is good for spending time and laughing with the director making a movie for capten america the greatest all because he is wearing an american flag and generally for raising up the american morality grow up and make a story as it should bewe are not americans all over the earthalso the movie has parts for laughing when starts the monologues the american boy as leaderif you are american you would be very proud of the movieif not i leave it up to you,fantasy
went to see this with low expectations and it was just as bad as i thought it would be very overratedall the lead up films are average incredible hulk was ok and captain america and thor are poor films but the two iron man films are pretty good but not brillianttheres so many story lines they could have done to make this film brilliant but the storyline reminds me a lot of transformers 3 except this has a bunch of superheroes instead of robots the same old storyline of the bad guys want to take over planet earth and the big problem with this film is we never really care about any of the characters theres no emotion in this film whatsoever this is a major spoiler dont read this part if you dont want to agent coulson who is in the lead up films dies and they try to make it emotional but none of the superheroes really care except maybe iron man but hes not that upset about itas for the acting performances theyre all poor the only actor who can come out of this film with any credit is robert downey jnr who is the reason im giving it a three out of ten he is the stand out performance in this star studded cast he is very good as tony starkiron man and is the only good thing about the film as for the rest of the cast they are all poor performances which is surprising because it such a good cast scarlett johannson is bad as black widow and as for jeremy renner he doesnt get much screen time as hawkeye theres a little bit of a story between these two characters but they never expand on it chris evans gives a wooden performance as captain america for me doesnt make a good captain america and mark ruffalo as bruce bannerincredible hulk is a slight improvement on edward norton but not brilliantthen theres the villain loki played by tom hiddleston who is so cheesy and predictable it is unreal and theres nothing threatening about him at all and with some saying the best villain ever must be joking hes a jokeso to conclude i dont know how this has got a 86 rating so dont believe how all the hype and fan boys it is on a par with transformers 3 which is not a good thing just nonstop action for no particular reason to sum up a very poor 310 when they could have done it so much better,fantasy
nothing to say beyond the title actually i can not see how this piece of moneymaking can compete with btw well overrated as well last batman franchise movies i told myself as soon as i heard about this movie that this will be totally for making money but a lot of positive reviews really a lot convinced me to go and see it myself well what can i say  this is not the worst but nothing like a good movie this is like a fun magazine youre reading during the train trip just not to be bored a lot of crappy senseless dialog a lot of arrogant stupid men in tights and a lot of senseless action  that is too much for me if youre below 13 or have completely nothing to do and this movies is around go ahead and watch it if youre a fan of superhero franchise and transformers is the best movie you can imagine of  you must see this movie otherwise stay away from it and dont believe positive reviews this is like the most regular superhero movie ever,fantasy
look i respect all people loving this kind of movies but its not an 81 rate movie because this is not something for everybody and it cant just be assumed to be top movie when its a movie for everybody it feels like someone have bought this rating on imdb it cant be reali have tried to like this kind of movies several times but i just cant watch them its not because its about superheroes but because they put all kind of superheroes in the same script they ruin superheroes its just not right i could watch hulk or spiderman in seperate movies but in the same movie its childish,fantasy
ive given it a five that was a lie and a illusion yes sir in real life im giving it a 05 because this movie sucks ass i do not like it why because zlatan approves and my cousin marius verboom hes hot as frog now go to your mom and tell her you love her because she is awesome and at last xnxxcom is the best of all sites sorry for my bad language but i need to fill this up shoutout to all my gang members and players in rotterdam west i love you then at last it just suck why i dont know because my guts tell me only for the red haired chick she is tight my love goes out to the jackson family because michael was really a cool dude,fantasy
well having seen this film a couple of years ago i now realise i am late to review it but better late than never this film received a lot of huge attention prerelease and for good reason you had many big superheroes in this film hulk iron man thor and captain america etc you knew a lot of comic book nerds or action film favouring individuals would watch this well its not that good in fact its as i said in the title mediocre first of all we are seeing the same villain again who we previously saw in thor loki who inexplicably returns for another marvel film seriously though there are plenty of other villains and yet they go with the same one weve probably seenanyway the surprisingly sarcasm triumph over loki by defeating him this is very predictable six superheroes against one villain by those odds its obvious who will win i mean they barely struggled in fact the struggle primarily came from within the team where they were fighting or having petty arguments with each other at parts though the film was funny the action scenes were impressive and the characters had good chemistrydialogue with each other but in my opinion there were no struggle with the heroes outmatching the enemy it was all too easy and you knew they would eventually overcome them they won very easily which is unsurprising with six heroes if truth be told anyway the enemies were generic alien robots that malfunctioned by one manoeuvre they were so easily outfought by the there were an overabundance of explosions and shooting which left me feeling irritated overall a generic action film generic enemies fights explosions too predictable im surprised how much money this film made and the ratings it got this is a film where you can only watch it once and be overjoyed a second time will be too boring and the third is unbearable to watch,fantasy
i think the most amazing thing about is seeing so many main characters of different franchises teaming up it is fantastic that they are played by the same actors as well except for the hulkthe plot is a clich nothing interesting in that the screenplay is not very good either and the acting isnt academy award material screenplay didnt help here when theres no realism in the story the field for the actor gets really small performances couldnt have been much better than thati missed edward nortonit was an entertaining movie but not more than that,fantasy
i am neither a marvel fan nor hater i even like some of their worse films like the spiderman series but i also disliked popular ones like thor i like their movies more when they take themselves to serious when i first watched the it was on an airplane so beautiful rendered cgi and effects werent influencing me through the small screen so it was mostly watching the story for me and i really think its marvels worst loki taking over the earth shield corporations super heroes on pms emotions and obscure aliens even worse were superfluous characters like the black widow it was just a huge mess of sci fi and super hero clichs so why do i give it a 5 a mediochre rating because it had good acting some funny scenes and when watched on a huge screen is pretty it makes little sense but it entertains i would say for people who cant stand unlogical stories this would propably rate much lower my sister hated it eg and for marvel fans its just nice fanservice,fantasy
i like marvel i really do and there is a lot done well with this movie however once fans get over the fact that oh my gosh all of the heroes are together and theres loki and hulk smash its so cool aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh you begin to see a lot of underlying problems beneath the standard eyecandy of action moviesfirst of all i have to admire how they built this film and the entire cinematic universe giving each hero their own standalone film really establishes them as tangible parts of this world regardless of how extraordinary they may be it was a long term investment that is just incredible to look back on if only it didnt culminate on such an average noteessentially the premise is that loki from thor has come back from the dead and has magically transported himself to earth using the tesseract  that cubething from captain america that can open interdimensional spaceportalssomehow loki plans on stealing the tesseract somehow knowing exactly what it is where it is and how to control it in order to send a generic alien army to earth to destroy itfor some reason honestly ive seen it several times and im still confused as to his motivation is it because thor likes natalie portman whateverin order to stop loki nick fury brings the together here we have a few more problems firstly the are supposed to be practically every single marvel hero ever printed i totally understand that that would be impossible but out of the few that are included why on earth do we have black widow and hawkeye they have no powers theyre not superheroes were already getting so few why not make them all superpowered thats not to say that either sharpshooter is bad but that theyre just disappointing in comparisonsecondly nobody develops at all as character i know that there are a lot of heroes to showcase and honestly im astounded at how evenly the screen time is divided between them however without any development theres nothing to connect to sure they developed in their own movies but this is a whole new film and as such it needs some character too basically the characters just go from okay i dont really like these other guys for some reason to team its so generic and it doesnt feel satisfying as a resultafter the heroes get together loki gets himself capturedfor some reason he then busts out launches the alien invasion and the go to stop him hulk magically learns to control his powerssomehow and they save the dayso overall theres really no character development and the villain lacks any motivation some effects dont even look finished hulk is still looks really fake and some shots are terribly obvious greenscreen notably when thor and hulk are fighting on an alien spaceshipits basically your average action flick explosions fights destroyed cars etc other than the fact that marvel brought these heroes together theres nothing spectacular about the film and its become overrated thanks to the love of fans nothing terrible but nothing extraordinary either,fantasy
so many mistakes in one moviethe biggest ones in the middle of the alien attack hulk rushed through a top floor of a building and people there are still working is it normal to keep on working in a high building if the city is under siege of a bunch of alienswhen there is a far view of the beam on the city you see ships still not moving away from itthey are not fleeing the scene the aliens that attack the earth have not even powerful weaponry only small firearmsor ships with a very small blast radius there are no huge blowsif i was to invade earth i would bring serious firepowerthe army of thanos has not i did not see the us air force anywhereyou would say that they would scramble all jets to fight the aliensthe army and navy with cruise missiles to knock of any target that comes out of the beam are not in sight eitherwhere are all other superheroes when earth is under siegeit makes no sense to make a event with this impact the earth is at stake if you are not able to get all heroes in one moviei know there are different franchises so i would suggest that something else would be at stake the live of a superheroes or a small republicnow this has become a movie with huge gaps all heroes survive miraculously and coulson relives in a series after he diedit is poor,fantasy
whedon has done an excellent job directing this movie getting such popular superheros together in one movie and giving them all equal screen time is a difficult task and whedon has perfected it highlight of the movie was fight between hulk and thor i was little disappointed when i heard that edward norton wont be playing role of hulk but after seeing ruffalos performance i was quite surprised hulk and iron man have great roles in this movie there is absolutely no flaw in the movie all the actors robert chris hemsworth chris evans mark scarlett samuel jeremy etc have done a fabulous job this is a movie not to be missed the last i really enjoyed watching superhero movie was spiderman 1 toby maguire this movie completely blew me away i went to watch this movie during the premier on thursday night and it was completely worth standing in big line at 12am in the night overall a fantastic movie do not miss it,fantasy
the is a great action movie people of all ages would enjoy especially geeks and fans of comics hulk thor captain america iron man and others are all in it the movie is actionpacked with amazing special effects but with the traditional storyline one would expect from similar films however it is not the storyline that defines this movie but the rich interactions of all these superhero characters as they try to work together to save the worldthe is entertaining with many funny moments oneliners unexpected events and even long fights between the superheroes themselves however the movie progresses very slowly which is a bit frustrating for a movie packed with superstars and a run time of two hours and 23 minutes although i appreciate the directors work in taking enough time to present the unique and complex personality of every character in the story the cast also does a great job with the characters and each of the superheroes gets their own chance to shine throughout the story although you can see the directors unique passion towards the iron man and hulk characters  joss whedon wrote the screenplay and directed the filmin short the movie is long but great and if you like marvels superheroes this is definitely the movie for you,fantasy
im levi from netherlandnext to germanyand this movie is also showed in my country and i liked it so much thats also because i am a huge fan of marvel movies but this one was until now the best marvel movie my favourite avenger is iron man robert downey jrbecause he is funny and just greatnow i have seen that there will be a sequel and there where questions who will die id say iron man because we saw in iron man 3 he dont need that glowing subject i dont know how its called anymore so there will be going a lot of wrong with jarvis but id might be wrong but this movie deserves a 9,fantasy
this movie smashed my expectations i thought it was going to be another action explosion movie with no plot but i was mistaken joss did a great job with this movie ill break it down acting on a scale of bad good or great  the acting was great for this genre scarlett johannsson did a good job as tough girl agent natasha romanoff jeremy renner did a good job also as machine level accuracy tough guy clint barton robert downey jr does a great job as billionaire philanthropist tony stark theres still a lot more chris hemsworth and tom hiddleston both do a great job as gods thor hemsworth and loki hiddleston mark ruffalo also does a great job as super geniusbig green rage monster bruce bannerthe incredible hulk chris evans does a good job as tough sortofsuperhumanoldguybutnot really steve rogerscaptain america samuel l jackson does a great job as smart but tough tactical expert nick fury and finally gwyneth paltrow does a good job as developmental womangirlfriend of tony stark pepper potts all of the other acting was good as well special effects great all of the special effects combined in the first 45 minutes are better than 10 syfy movies special effects especially the end sequence whoa i have to hold my horses ok the special and visual effects throughout the whole movie were great and are as good if not better than other marvel movies especially the 90s ones the earlier fights within the air plane carrier plane thing with the hulk and the black widow and thor and all that stuff and jets and falling through the sky is all great i also has great special effects in the end battle sequence in manhattan new york dialogue the dialogue was also great it was serious smart and humorous throughout the movie at just the right times one of my favorite quotes was from tony stark raise the mizzenmast jib the topsails this really was a comedy at times it kept the movie more pleasant than it would have been without it story the story was overall original i thought and i think they probably shouldnt make another one but that is just my opinion i give this movie a 910 overall because it is funny realistic special effectswise and had great acting i recommend this movie to anyone who likes action scifi or fantasy,fantasy
all i should have to say about this movie that i have seen at least 10 times is its a joss whedon film what more is there to say but i wont cause the anti buffyangelfireflydollhouse fans will yell and scream so instead i will just do a regular reviewthis joss whedon film the stars robert downey jr as ironman chris hemsworth as thor chris evans as captain america scarlett johansson as the black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye and mark ruffalo as hulk i like that 23 are the same actors hawkeye is new to the group and hulk well the hulk has been played now by 3 different actors bruce banner went from tall and built to a little shorter and lankier to short and hispanic looking hmmm well regardless of who bruce banner is played by one thing stays the same you dont get the hulk angry as for the black widow at least when she appears in iron man 2 they kept the same actress i will admit that i never have been a fan of scarlett johansson as an actress or as one to read about in the tabloids however she kicks some major as in this movie and the chemistry that she has with our hott jeremy renner is very appealing yes i know they dont actually have a sexual or physical anything on screen but their friendship shows promise there is a heat without it actually being sexual or physical i like the way they care for each other i must also add that i love that samuel l jackson is the ring leader he is the same smartass that he usually playsthis movie has a straight plot and lots of action there is no time that i noticed that it goes off track like some movies do i like that everyone plays their character correctly captain america is a straight talking guy he gives direction without hesitation as a great leader should especially for this group iron man aka tony stark is his witty sarcastic smart self i can honestly say that if robert downey jr were to discontinue the part of iron man i would not go and see any of the movies thor is his badass thunder god self with the love of earth and the love of his brother though as he says hes adopted i like that everyone can shoot at each other with the sarcastic remarksif you have the chance to get the movie on dvd or bluray then do so i got the 3 disc special edition that came with digital and music download i got it cheaper online at amazon than i would have in the stores though this was before tax was added on the site there are bloopers that are hysterical the scene that they are all arguing joss whedon joins the scene saying stop arguing cracks me up every time i see it or think of itgood job joss,fantasy
every fan geeks ultimate wet dream has been realized in this action movie that brings together all of the marvel superheros that have appeared separately in their own films its not a big shocker that the film is loud bombastic and only marginally coherent it also happens to be exciting funny and self aware enough to know just how seriously to treat the material the result may not be one of the best action films ever made but its probably one of the better ones to be released in recent yearsthe boys in this movie  robert downey jr chris evans liam hemsworth mark ruffalo and jeremy renner  are clearly meant to own the show but its scarlett johannsson who steals itgrade b,fantasy
after an excruciating four year wait the scene after the credits of 2008s iron man with jackson set the internet alight and five films leading to this massive point assemble is here this film is the cinematic peak of 2012 so much time effort spoilers comiccon appearances and millions of other components have been put into this picture it is a marvel fan boys nirvana an action fans expectation fulfiller and only a foetus could dislike the whole of this film expertly written and beautifully acted out complete with the best special effects ever makes assemble not just a film to watch once or twice its a film to watch until your disc player explodes every single character gets their chance to shine and they play out well and although hawkeye and black widow renner and johansson havent had their own films hawkeye had a brief cameo in thor black widow had a more obvious involvement in iron man 2 they are just as great as captain america and iron man assemble youd be a fool to miss it overall one of the best films of the millennium watch the hulk vs loki scene for the best takeout ever,fantasy
i saw this movie 1 hour agoon bluray quality of the disc is superbbut the movie is not that goodits a little too long i thinkand is surely intented for teens  kids mostly yes that is right unlike batman hulk 1  2  spiderman 3this is for teenyoung adultsthis movie is not serious at allbut its still a good watchi did prefer this better than transformers 2 howeverbut for example xmen trilogy and last stand were way betterthe last 45mn of the movie are quite nice and explosive all in all a decent but spectacular movie,fantasy
i have been a comic fan since the mid 90s after a gap of almost 15 years a recently picked up my old hobby much has changed since i last read spiderman wolverine and the punisher i never have been a fan of fantastic four or the and after this movie i wont change my mind about itnot that the is a bad film its really not but its not all that the hype pretends it is whedon makes a very enjoyable popcornmovie thats true to its comic book roots you get a lot of bang for your buck 6 superheroes in a 2 hour movie whedon keeps all his movies light and with humor i finally see what he intended with alien resurrection although i still think it would not have worked alien doesnt lend itself for humor but this material does and whedon does it well the story isnt too complicated im glad all these movies use elements from the golden or silver age of the original comics the story is a oldschool kinda story not complicated and with little back story because all of them had an individual one some even twothe effects are well done although i think on a tv screen even by todays standards its just too chaotic to really follow i had the same feeling with the horrendous transformerfilms although the action in this film isnt half as confusing as those three turdsall and all its a nice blockbuster with steady performances good action and an old fashioned humorous story i could write half a page about it being a little too patriotic and militaristic but hey im european i really dont get all the fascination with guns and jets and stuff,fantasy
special effects were great plot line ok spoiled by wooden acting of some of the cast robert downey jr as stark was the best part of the film he made it 100 more watchable as soon as he appeared on set a couple of one liners added a few laughs but overall im glad it was a free movie on foxtel and i didnt waste my cash on a movie ticket the villain was ok though he did remind me of grimma wormtongue from lord of the rings who was a much better bad guy thorwell sorry he and captain america just werent very good actors in this movie you just didnt endear to their characters the hulk guy was ok he played a good dr david banner,fantasy
this film is for young school kids teenagers or young adults w penchant for comic books heroes it will not do a lot of good for viewers who expect quality in acting serious plot and dramatic ending w special aftereffect scifi battleactions and latest special effects and equipment having no real standout personality you can see from the talk amount to not much for one to remember the movie about in the line of many other movies that fall in the same footsteps that is this action intense extravaganza will be forgotten very quick even with its attempt to insert some kidlevel comic events along the way the movie does not deserve 7 stars nor does it fall into a 6 category since its making suggests or dictates achievement of visualcinematographic effects of some level all of which clearly worth of some praise imo,fantasy
see title black widow had a lot more thor especially please he barely spoke the first bit of the movie was kind of slow although the thor and captain america movies were like that as well except were as those films fell short when it came to action this film rose i loved the comedy of the film involving the hulk great cast i wished that loki seemed more evil because the entire time i just felt he looked too nice im not sure what it was he just didnt seem completely evil i found myself wishing he was a good guy haha i dont know anything about the comics have never read any of them so i am most definitely not the most reliable source to rate this movie see what the fans of the comics say and you shall get the truth,fantasy
the was the best action thriller i have seen after a long while i absolutely loved it and recommend each and everyone of u that its a must watch in cinemas one more thing cobie smulders and scarlet jhonson 3  all the characters including hulk iron man and captain america are portrayed to their full potential which is the most exuberant part of the movie the team of superheros have been given a unique shape with a diverse story throughout the movie i absolutely loved hulk and iron man as they were simply awesome most of all i saw it in 3d and i suggest to each and everyone of you go and surly watch it in 3d for an exciting experience im hoping it will b the movie of the year,fantasy
in fact there is no need to comment on this film and everything done is perfect it should be congratulated that films director and writer the film came up to my expectations totally cast of the film consists of my favorite actor and actress whose name are jeremy renner and scarlett johansson a negative thing about film the beginning of the film is a bit boring because scenes in the film take place in a ship i guess which made me a bit bored but the scenes which was taking place in city is very fantastic and realistic which made me very excitedafter watching it immediately i examine om imdb in terms of its budget gross and vote i saw that its gross is approaching one million dollars and also its rate is 87 and absolutely it deserves thatthe another thing which impresses me is unbelievable scenes they are really really perfect and still have a bearing upon this film also the extraterrestrials who are coming other planet is very realisticespecially character of hulk is very funny and attractive to sum upbut for beginning of the film rest of the film is very great and thanks director and cast for presenting such a fantastic film,fantasy
perhaps the highest praise i can offer the is that it is exactly like a classic comic book story come to life the epic scope the hopelessly outnumbered team of heroes fighting for our lives the diabolical villains and action action and more actionits all here in one incredible liveaction package is the the best superhero film ever made maybe not but considering the grand scale and everything that had to come together just to avoid a bomb its hard not to dismiss the few minor weaknesses and simply applaud what does work which is after all nearly everythingtrue the is a very long movie and if you havent seen the other marvel superhero films especially thor and captain america it may take you a while to figure out exactly whats going on but this isnt rocket science its a comic book come to life and it wont take even a complete newcomer long to get up to speeddirector and screenwriter joss whedon has to get a lot of the credit for making the film such a success whedon clearly knows and loves the characters hes working with and he wisely takes his time exploring each heros personality captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth iron manrobert downey jr  hulk mark ruffalo hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson could have easily just been heartless blockbusters but whedon instills each of them with personal style and spirit the banter between the various heroes as they slowlyand painfullylearn to work together is nearly as exciting as the inevitable showdown between the forces of good and evilnearly that is the climax is one of the grandest spectacles of mayhem ever filmed far surpassing the similar final battles that have been the apex of the various transformer movies as in the comics the are brought together by the machinations of loki thors evil brother once again played to brilliant perfection by tom hiddleston but this time loki has an army of extraterrestrials backing him up and it is suggested that there are other forces involved that may be even more wicked than loki himselfthrow in samuel l jackson as nick fury head of the clandestine shield organization and you have everything a longtime aficionado could have hoped for incredibly thrilling very wellacted and directed with a witty script and heroes you can really believe in at least for a couple of hoursthe is an instant action classic,fantasy
right its too long for a start way too long partly because director joss whedon has chosen to write 6back stories before the actual story begins but when it does the effects are so off the scale as to mesmeriseits funny in parts ruffalo as the hulk has all the comedy gasp out loud adventure moments but thomas downie junior continues to build a body of light comedy work thats slowly making him best in class scarlett johansonn has an admirable ass but adds little other than that cobie smulders is hot and so is gweyneth paltrowthe cgi and sfx as the aliens invade new york in the final reel are the best i have ever seen by a long way the destruction of manhattan is actually quite scary reminding us as it does of 911cinematography by seamus mcgarvey surely one of edinburghs great film exports despite being an ulsterman is a career high of many highswithout the back stories this would have been little short of perfection with them its too long so gets a seven out of ten,fantasy
big bombastic comic book movie about a bunch of marvel comics characters teaming up to defeat alien invaders four of the original are joined by two other marvel heroes hawkeye renner and black widow johanssen for the most part all are properly costumed unlike xmen and fit their roles admirably hulk continues to stand out like a sore thumb as he remains strictly a cgi creation but mercifully we see little of him until well into the second half the actor playing the hunted tortured bruce banner ruffalo easily turns in the films strongest performancethe two additions to the original roster the widow and hawkeyeare without superpowers but are just as effective when push comes to shove director whedon of serenity fame paces the film extremely well so that were not overdosed with video gamelike cgi until the big finale theres plenty of character development for a twohour comic book movie theres also plenty of humor and the punchlines come and go faster than thor hemsworth can twirl his hammer the film also boasts a villain worthy of the gang thors halfbrother loki hiddleston that actor has by far the silliest lines to deliver mainly to do with he conquest of earth and the subjugation of the human race yet manages to make them sound convincing enough he also knows when to play it for laughs courtesy of whedons sharp direction while downey as iron man may be outacted by ruffalo his character is the glue that binds even though capt america evans is the leader without downeys quirky tony stark there would be no movie sam jackson makes his third film appearance as nick fury agent of shield although im not clear on why he was dressed for a matrix movie is worth a look even if youre not a comic book fan you can always skip the big battle at the end which is straight out of a video game funny thing whedon reveals the villain who will appear in the sequel following the credits this villain makes loki look like a circus clown,fantasy
you will be dazzled and ultimately somewhat exhausted by all the characters and story lines i love each one of these heroes individually but i have to admit it was all too much for me and then for sentiment they add a gratuitous scene which is real sad when a minor character dies to give context to it all it was dashed together crammed together and bashed up all together i am glad i went to see it but i was a bit bewildered and my butt hurt i was overwhelmed and underwhelmed i think that is really all i have to say but this site wants me to write much more and i think i have said enough i dont want to dissuade anyone from seeing it especially if you are a fan but this is really how me and my friends felt it made a billion dollars on its opening weekend so there is no slowing this movie down i could have skipped it and felt all the better for it had i trusted someones opinion but everyone is rushing around trying to laud this monster hit so my voice is not going to be heard in this din,fantasy
this film is entertaining it is fun and has some amusing lines but at the end of the day is nothing more than the culmination of a marketing scheme started in 2008 with the iron man film i didnt like that film then felt like spiderman with a different coat of paint and this one feels like xmen yes theres stunts and action but lets be honest scarlett johansen looks like shes working out what to buy with her fee throughout the entire thing the 3d effects were awful bar the flying arrow at the end and samuel l jackson is there to merely spout expositionary dialogue more at home in a saturday morning kids cartoon there will be more it will make a fortune in a world where whole first world countries are going bankrupt and it will be forgotten in about one years time,fantasy
an amiable way to while awayhow long was it i found it less engaging than either iron man 1 or thor and whilst the dialogue interludes were welcome relief from all that crashing and banging they didnt really go anywhere to help create believable characters not the point perhaps you cant create belief in demigods and superheroes who are to all intents and purposes indestructible by endowing them with mortal failings like arrogance brotherly love rage patriotism and a desire to set the record straight on the plus side mark ruffalos hulk stupendous effects undermined by their ruthless efficiency  theyre not special anymore and a couple of good belly laughs scarlett johansson in leather,fantasy
the is a great film and one of my favorites films of 2012 so farthe acting was just amazing by all the actors involved in the filmthe best performances in the film were robert downey jr as iron man who played his character perfectly and mark ruffalo as hulk the director of the film was joss whedon who directed the film with a great passion to make a great film which he did the basic plot was iron manhulkthor and captain america team up to try to stop loki from overtaking earth the actors in the film were robert downey jr chris evansmark ruffalochris hemsworthsamuel jacksonscarlet johannson and jeremy renner overall the film was a major success and i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
first of all i never give anything a 10 because that means perfection and giving the movie a 9 also leaves some kind of room for improvement for any potential future movies with that in mind i may even give this a 95after movies such as spiderman being a disappointment and having the newest batman series to compare to the i wasnt sure what to expect also taking into consideration that the latest marvel movies such as the xmen origin movies and individual ironman 1 and 2 thor hulk seeming to have fairly good ratings or at least good movies to me i was almost curious if this was going to be a disappointment after a streak of good movies at the same time i usually walk into movies with low expectations so if it is a let down im not as let down as other people are however with this movie i couldnt help but to have a higher expectation seeing previous marvel moviesso being really excited for this movie during and after the movie i was thrilled with it it blew my mind and i seriously felt like a kid in awe and they did so well taking childhood characters and making it possible to be watched by any agefor the tough critics if you are not a fan of comic book superheros or just not a fan of any of the marveldc movies i would recommend this film if i was to try to change your mind i know some who were let down by thor andor captain america and a couple people who were slightly disappointed by ironman then i believe the movie will fully redeem those disappointments for youif you also havent seen any of the individual movies thor ironman 1  2 captain america hulk its not an absolute much to watch i do believe it sure does help though so if youre going to see any movie this year this will be a great one to watch,fantasy
the first of the two most highly anticipated superhero films of the summer is here and it doesnt disappoint the more than makes up for the last few disappointing summer movie seasons weve had i dont think ive had this much fun at a movie since pixars up this two and a half hour movie never fails to excitethe plot is standard superhero movie fare loki tom hiddleston thors evil step brother breaks out of prison with the aid of a race of super evil aliens loki proceeds to steal a super weapon from the realm of asgard thors universe and threatens the world nick fury in a routine performance by samuel l jackson must assemble a team of superheroes to combat loki iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans the incredible hulk mark ruffalo replacing ed norton the black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner loki unleashes his evil army on new york city and the must do what they always do kick buttmarvel was truly clever to give these characters their own individual franchises before making an movie and not just in a financial sense since we all know these characters already the movie doesnt suffer from too many characters syndrome unlike another marvel franchise about a superhero team marvel fans know what i mean each characters story continues in the and it feels perfectly natural it is the chemistry of this cast that really makes this film work personalities clash until the gravity of the situation sits in and they start to cooperate predictably by the end of the film they are all friends but why complain its all in good fungiven that these are really second tier superheroes in the marvel comics gallery sorry fans but spiderman and xmen are higher up in the hierarchy i am amazed that they were adapted to film so well all of these movies pulled off their protagonists very well but they have slightly weak antagonists and this movie is no exception loki is a decent character and hiddleston is a decent enough actor but he just doesnt have the dramatic weight to match the power of thea review wouldnt be complete without some description of the action as expected its fantastic from a technical standpoint but its extra fun because you care about the characters so much maybe thats just me i personally could have used more bruce bannerincredible hulk moments i felt he was really overshadowed by the other teammates ruffalo was at a disadvantage because he was taking over for edward norton but the incredible hulk scenes are great easily my favorite action momentsi must say this is probably my favorite marvel superhero movie because its just so fun it doesnt need to get bogged down in character moments it is just a shameless roller coaster ride so go see the it is the first action flick of what looks like to be a very promising summer for action movies and be sure to stick around until the very end of the credits,fantasy
first i would like to say that i was thoroughly impressed by this movie i was not sure how they would successfully pull all the characters together but they certainly found a way the graphics were top notch and the action scenes which were every 5 minutes were well put together the movie accommodated the perfect mix of action humor and drama my only complaint came at the end of the movie during the epic battle finale while the heroes were awesome to watch in action i expected to see some us air force involved while the movie is not meant to be realistic it just would have made more since to me if they incorporated a little more military involvement because i feel like a country with cpt america would still attempt to defend its greatest city from alien invaders with more than just a few national guard guys like transformers did in their films overall that was just something that could have been added the movie was outstanding and still made the top of my list for 2012 cant wait to see the next one,fantasy
this is the most bad ass movie i have ever seen each hero gets enough time to be developed and the you will be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie one of the things that helped this movie was all the main heroes were in their own movies so they could be given back story this was a good idea cause doing back story for all of them in one movie would have been impossible it has a bunch of memorable scenes that make you love the characters even more the final fight scene is definitely the best part were they finally are together to make their stand against the enemy it does have some minor flaws but this movie definitely makes up for all the flaws some people thought this movie would be bad because of too many heroes in the same movie but if anything this proves you can make a movie with all these different heroes and be awesome if they make a justice league movie after this they need to get joss whedon to make it cause he definitely knew what he was doing and i believe hes the only one that knows how to make movies like this so awesome,fantasy
what a great action packed movie of marvels finest it took me some time to finally get a chance to watch it and it is just phenomenal what can i say about this movie the acting was good the story was ok the special effects were nonetheless impressive and the heroes costumes were great i agree with a friend of mine on this and that is the is marvels own expendables the all star team that everyone roots for i also liked the ever comedic lines of tony stark as portrayed by robert downey jr he is quite the character there were some other comedic spots of the movie that kind of fit and i just couldnt stop laughing even the audience was laughing with me however there were some disappointments for me number one hulk wasnt played by ed norton instead we got mark ruffalo in my opinion he just felt out of place i mean evans downey and hemsworth are topnotch alisters and then you got ruffalo who just doesnt fit in with them and number two i was expecting red skull over loki thats just me loki was a good formidable villain for the but i think red skull would have made the movie even more kick ass overall this gets a 9 out of 10,fantasy
im a comic book nerd i grew up on spiderman xmen and anything and everything stan lee and jack kirby helped produce i had seen every tiein movie in theaters as soon as i had a chance i remember watching iron man and everyone had told me to stay after the credits because there was a huge surprise waiting for me at the end so began the most painful 4 years of my lifein the 1960s comic books were fun excursions into a world where magic science and wonder all coexisted it was a world where it would be perfectly normal if a giant dragon a man with the abilities of a spider and a god straight out of norse mythology all got into a fight to the death i know a lot of people are going to disagree with me so im just going to go ahead and get to my point the is the greatest superhero movie of all timebut what about the dark knight you may ask the dark knight was a fantastic film in its own regard but that sense of wonder and mystery was replaced by realism and fear which is ok because you dont go to a batman movie expecting him to fight against a large supernatural force but for me the wonder and fantasy is what really defines a superhero story whether its a comic or a movieanyway the were assembled perfectly this is truly a benchmark in the movie industry successfully combining the universes of four different movies into one creating the grandest spectacle i have ever seen on screen if you havent yet i recommend seeing all the tiein movies before seeing the if not for the sake that they are all great movies by themselves then for the fact that the will be a lot more enjoyable if you are already familiar with the charactersjoss whedon has done a remarkable job of taking each of these characters already having such strong personalities and making them interact with each other for me the beauty of this movie wasnt the action scenes it was the interactions between the characters whedon really understands these heroesand speaking of action scenes lets talk about how awesome the action scenes were i was afraid that the trailer had already shown all the great moments in the film but thankfully i was wrong i was really wrong there is a plethora of fights in this movie both between the heroes and the villains and between the heroes themselves and every hero gets their moments in the limelight even black widow and hawkeye who i was worried might bog down the fights were just as much of a part of the team as thor and iron man were but lets be honest here this is the hulks movie hulk had disappointed me in most of his previous movie outings but not this time joss whedon finally got the character right you can see the fear behind banners eyes the sense of hopelessness in his voice he really is cursed but must learn to use his curse for the greater good and when he finally does change into the hulk hulk smashes hulk smashes a lotthe cant be passed over as a marketing scheme it deserves every cent that it reeled in from its opening weekend this isnt just a great superhero movie its one of the greatest movies i have had the pleasure of seeing,fantasy
i had my skepticism when going to this movie would it be incredibly corny who it live up to all the hype who we just wish it was iron man 3 but i was shocked at the masterful film joss whedon put together he had a great balance of all the stars and big personalities he left me wanting more from the relationship of black widow and hawkeyenow im not saying this is a perfect film but it definitely surpasses the previous attempts of team of superheroes ie xmen and the fantastic four some characters left me wanting more yes im talking about you mark ruffalo i felt like i was watching another one of his lame romantic comedies every time he was on the screen dont get me started on the mark ruffalos stuff face on the hulk give me the big green monster from the incredible hulk and i would be closer to a 10 than a 9 for this movieall things considered this movie went by in a flash with all the brilliant action sequences and the great script writing i cant wait for the next film it should be incredible if joss whedon is involved marveldisney dont let that man go because you have no chance unless you can get chris nolan to do spiderman for you because we all know that is going to be a let down,fantasy
it has been a long time that i had to wait in line to buy a ticket and then wait in line again to get a good seat the was well worth the wait director joss whedon definitely got it right with this film although the film was nearly two and a half hours long it did not feel like it because the momentum of the story flowed so well as you can tell by the trailer loki tom hiddleston has returned to take over the earth and is met by a cast of superheroes assembled by nick fury samuel l jackson all of the main characters were true to form iron man  tony stark robert downey jr was exactly like you would expect him to be arrogant smart and playful thor chris hemsworth follows his so called brother loki to earth and the tension between them has not changed from the last time that these two hit the big screen the hulk  bruce banner mark ruffalo somehow manages to somewhat tame his beast and join the party captain america  steve rogers chris evans has the daunting task of trying to catch up with time while forming a relationship with his new found comrades i found him to be the most endearing of the heroes because he had so much catching up to do since he was thawed out the two heroes that did not have their own introduction prior to this film were black widow  natasha romanoff scarlett johansson and hawkeye  clint barton jeremy renner although i think that a prequel could possibly work because i think that there is definitely some history there i have to say that i was not expecting this film to have the level of comedy that it did i think that the whole audience was caught a little off guard myself included everything about this film was excellent the acting the special effects the character development the script i could go on and on i am almost certain that this is not the last time that we see the i smell the beginning of many more sequels in the future and i will once again stand in that long line to go and see them this is not the time to be frugal dig in your pockets and go and see this film at the imax in 3d i am giving this film a glaring green light,fantasy
yeahit is an action packed flick from beginning to end the interweaving of all the marvel characters was done in a coherent way and i truly feel as though i got my moneys worth out of it samuel l jackson is an amazing actor and if you think about all the roles hes executed so well it boggles the mind this is not to diminish the performances of all the other names who appear in this film robert downey by far has the best lines and his delivery is always spot on the cgi effects are great flawless and awesome plot screenplay and performancesgrade b i was a big fan of marvel as a kid and the whole package stays true to the printed genre mark ruffalo was a good pick for the latest hulk incarnation gweneth paltrow and scarlett johansson turn in fine performances and look hhhhotttt i know that its just a movie one must suspend reality and have buyin and i dont want to be hypercritical but1 i would expect that hulk  thor would be uninjured in their battles and even ironman has his suit to protect himbut the other three characters after all are really just human right though enhanced human in some way shape or form they just arent in the same class of super hero as the previously mentioned three in fact they arent super at all i would think that each of them in succession would have been squashed by something thrown at them by one of the warriors from another planet 2 the suitingup process for ironman is starting to become a little silly and i didnt like the shape change of the power plant in the middle of his chest from a circle to a triangle 3 the hulk goes from a mindlesswellhulk to a character who then helps the teampick pick pickafter you see it im sure youll agree that this movie is definitely not an 88 as movies gobut the ratings system at this venue has always been flawed if you dont read too much into it its pretty solid entertainment especially if youre an action fan marvel fan or a fan of any of the actors involved and worth seeing on the big screen especially because the sound systems seem to have been upgraded in recent timesbut i wouldnt pay more than matine pricepsthere is an additional snippet of movie inserted into the credit roll so dont exit too quicklythe only thing that really ticked me off was the 7 price tag for a medium popcorn get real people  i rate it 7,fantasy
walking into the i was expecting a total popcorn film with great visuals explosions and awesome fighting i got that but i also got a pretty good story great comical dialogue and a great mix of badassery and fun i think their aim with this film was to have the awesome explosions as well as the funny script make this movie enjoyable for the whole family with this aim i think they pulled it off flawlessly the fighting sequences had you ready to stand up and applaud and the lines were legitimately funny and there wasnt a corny superhero line throughout the whole thing thank the lord now to answer my question above could it have been better my answer is yes i think the movie was a bit too predictable in ways like how in every moment of trouble somebody comes out of nowhere and saves the day i mean of course they cant have anything too extreme but it was a bit campy in the sense of how iron man would fly out of nowhere and swoop somebody up seconds before the get destroyed also the biggest problem i had was with loki loki was a decent choice for the villain but the had absolutely no trouble with him not at all i mean he is a god and they beat the crap out of him each moment before he got done talking i almost felt like there really wasnt any struggle in this film other than the city getting demolished but in the end i was excited and had a great time watching it i give the a 7 out of 10,fantasy
greetings again from the darkness the concern coming in was that this would be like an allstar game which as any sports fan will tell you is typically a massive letdown assembling so many super heroes and colorful characters into one movie captain america thor iron man hawkeye black widow nick fury and loki  would probably lead to either mass confusion a 4 hour movie or short straws for a couple of characters somehow director joss whedon has avoided the pitfalls and delivered a huge action film that is loads of fun for everyone including the fanboyswhedon does a remarkable job of giving each character their fair share of screen time and somehow manages to make the interaction between the characters the best part of the movie there is some terrific dialogue and the number of quickwitted exchanges are too numerous to recount while this would be expected from robert downey jrs iron man i must admit to being pleasantly surprised at chris hemsworths thor and especially mark ruffalos dr bannerhulk the movie contains quite a few laugh outloud moments which is pretty impressive in a filled theatreif you are going to combine six super heroes in a movie you need a bad guy a villain actually a super villain tom hiddleston as loki is up to the task for me he was a weak link in thor but here is a fullfledged powerful evil mastermind looking to gain power by stealing the tesseract cosmic cube commanding an alien army and ruling earth hiddleston is clearly having fun and it shows for the movie to work at all his plan and power must stand up to the impressive line up of good guys he is fighting that is certainly the casescarlett johansson as black widow has come a long way from her brief work in iron man2 and we really get to know more about natasha the russian spy  although her accent fades in and out jeremy renner as hawkeye seems a bit out of place but renner is so cool we dont really care chris evans as captain america does a wonderful job of taking control of the band of misfits and displays the leadership expected of a supersoldier we even get a good dose of agent coulson phil to his friends and clark greggs deadpan deliver is a great addition samuel l jackson as nick fury will be adding hundreds of millions more to his current record of being the highestgrossing actor of alltimegwyneth paltrow is back as pepper potts since last we saw her she has evidently been shopping for short shorts and helping design the new stark tower natalie portman makes a creative cameo reprising her awful role in thor stellan skarsgard is back as a believable scientist powers boothe appears as a member of the council that fury reports to the great harry dean stanton has a comical scene as a security guard who stumbles onto hulks mess and of course stan lee makes his welldeserved cameo appearance  a tradition in the marvel moviesmuch of the credit for this must go to joss whedon he may finally be out of his buffy the vampire slayer shadow as this movie is quite an accomplishment entertaining and funny for the masses yet detailed enough for the comic book fan boys i was thinking how much fun this would be for a 1012 year old and how my mind might have exploded if something like this existed in my childhood even comparing this to the christoper reeve superman movies will help you realize just how far super heroes movies have come,fantasy
thisone of the most awaited movies of 2012 did not disappoint me even a bita truly remarkable movie and hats off to mrjoss whedon for such a great direction even though the movie had little slow starta superb acceleration to excitement and action that followed takes away all the credit the best part of it was even though its an action moviea great addition of humor and funny moments intelligently added at perfect timings was added entertainment which really did not let me get bored even for a second i would say its one of the most watchable action movie ever made and also kudos to mrrobert downey jrfor awesome acting and comedy timings,fantasy
as usual for a hollywood movie of this scale was hypedreceived good reviews but i had a doubt if the movie could deliver what it promised pure fun and it sure as hell delivered excitementthrillaction and everything you want from a superhero movie with a joss whedon touchthe way the characters interact from the beginning to the end is funrdjalways at you with witty one liners chris evansmaintains the character he built in captain america chris hemsworthwell he continues the story arc from thor of brother vs brothermark ruffalowhat an amazing addition to the castthe hulk really stands out in the movie loki pure menace hawkeyeperfectly cast black widowlooks do kill,fantasy
enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions joss whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film iron man is the machine with a heart who never shows it the hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it and most surprising of all black widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance all hints of fear love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions scarlett johansson is a casting choice to be applauded as is mark ruffalo since i now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the rolewhedon nailed nearly every single scene he made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated this movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots i have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if i wanted to describe my feelings and after seeing the trailer and the pictures i already had high expectationsthe charisma of captain america the wild brutality of the hulk the majesty of thor it was all there i was never the biggest fan of but right now after writing these lines i am going to read up some avenger comic books from my collection and we have 2 am,fantasy
i was fortunate enough to watch a special presentation of the the earlier this week due to the sheer awesomeness of the movie i felt it was appropriate to spread the good word ill try not to ruin too much for you though interested parties know the basic plot by nowa group of superpeople captain americasteve rogers chris evans iron mantony stark robert downey jr thorthor chris hemsworth and the incredible hulkbruce banner mark ruffalo are brought together by a top secret task force known as shield to form a super team known as the shield headed by superspy nick fury samuel l jackson and a huge expensive looking airborne armada face a serious threat in the form of supervillain loki tom hiddleston can the divergent personalities come together to face such a large external threat if they do will the audience care the answer is of course yes and yes the is less of a movie than it is a dazzling visual experience my bet is those who lived in the time of 5 cent captain america comics would have their minds blown by the sheer size and grandior of this flick its big its bold and it delivers but enough with general platitudes what specifically makes the such great summer fare well for one it takes four characters who have dawned their own movie franchises and brings them together for the first time since we all know their origins their powers and their basic personalities this spinoff is in a unique position to expand the world in which these superheroes exist this world of course has a lot of explosions and movie monsters but it also has a fair amount of heart and humor tooall due credit must be given to its smart script provided by joss whedon and zak penn who seemed to have had just as much fun writing the movie as i did watching it every scene has a purpose and nearly every joke hits its mark that not to say the movie is all fun and games the movie wisely shines a light on the back story of black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner two characters who have been largely in the shadows in the past this allows especially black widows character arc to become the convincing emotional core of the film there is one confrontation between black widow and loki that provided no whizzbang vulgarities but nonetheless was an uncommonly dark and emotionally charged moment one i wouldnt expect from such an unabashedly popcorny flickthe character of loki has improved greatly from the last time we saw him in thor 2011 i found him a bit too unassuming and snively to really be threatening in 2011 this year however tom hiddleston has wisely cranked the diva dial up to 11 and lets loose its hard not to soak up all his bravura or samuel l jacksons for that matter hes supposed to be nick fury and god love him for trying but hell always be samuel l and thats not all together a bad thingthere are however some slight faults to this otherwise solid film i know its unfair since the is a sequel of sorts but there seemed to be too little development or back story about our main heroes i dont want to say that those who havent seen the other marvel movies will be completely lost but i doubt theyll have the same emotional investment in the characters coming in from the cold a few lines of exposition without them sharing witty banter would have been enough im not greedy also and this is just my personal bias mark ruffalo did his best but i was not convinced he was bruce banner his lax california toocoolforschool delivery just didnt mesh well with the scifi jargon he and tony stark were spewingregardless of a few shortcomings the is a profoundly entertaining movie with great action great acting and a fun script it sets the new gold standard comicbook superhero films have to reach in the years to come watch it then watch it againhttptheyservepopcorninhellblogspotcom,fantasy
ive seen the big names that claimed to be crowned in this scifi action section battlefield john carter prometheus wrath of gods etc  but to my disappointment none of them were qualified to win my personal vote apart from this one here  the babyyy its been a long time since i havent seen such a powerful contender its definitely a riot as transformers 1  years back good choice in actors  true champions not fakes like the spiderman nerd i believe every character in this new movie rises sky high along with it even the green hulk has my sympathy in the end though its a simple computerized toon after all what glorious times for all these guys  they go down in the movie industrys history with this one big time and the best part is that its quite amusing at the same time  i had some laughs and its definitely the key to an enjoyable show you have it all  especially memorable special 3d effects well done thats a movie you wont get tired of so easily its here to last,fantasy
there are four films this year i am banking on being at the top of my list and assemble was the lesser my god 2012 going to be a good year for moviesmarvel studios colossal gamble in combining four of their major comic brands into one film was subject to feeling clustered and failing yet having gotten each heros back story and characteristics out of the way in previous films can go all out no brakes genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark aka iron man is teamed up with doctor bruce banner the incredible hulk steve rogers the super soldier captain america and thor the god of thunder to protect the world from a hostile invasion led by thors brother loki they have to learn to put their personal demons aside and work together if they are to succeed assemble is another landmark in cinema after harry potter keeping firm continuity on a franchise makes it stronger the actors already know their characters the films first act dips wonderfully into character moments one minute it is a new iron man film then it is thors movie simply revels in their clashing personalities a geeky what if thor tony stark and captain america were in a room together i cannot stress the credit due to joss whedon cowriter and director he brought is agame here the wit and stinging dialogue is here in abundance the cinema i was in was roaring with laughter at all the right points there are several short signature fights giving each hero and villain a chance to fight another though this does not feel forced instead each battle feels unique memorable and is certainly eye catchingthe films heart and soul is with the superheroes and while their personal demons are less defined here for obvious reasons there are six of them the battles they wage show them struggling marvels ethos of human superheroes is not completely lost here by the end the heroes are quite worse for wear loki is the signature villain and one should watch thor and captain america to fully appreciate whats at stake the villains are pushed aside overall but only for the excellent teambuilding theme the film is about anywaydefinitely worth seeing for the great dialogue alone never mind the frantic and characterful battle sequences on top of it,fantasy

a culmination of several movie franchises the certainly delivers there could have been many ways that the studios could have screwed this movie up but they chose the right director joss whedon former helmer of buffy the vampire slayer and firefly on tv as well as an actual comic book writer for marvel comics whedon knows his stuff and he creates what is probably the most compatible comic book movie ever the whole film reads as if it was an actual marvel comic bookwhedon subtly melds the disparate elements from multiple other comic book movies and effortlessly creates an epic storyline that makes sense the tesseract known to comic fans as the cosmic cube that was the focal plot point of captain america the first avenger 2011 has been recovered and being studied closely by the government when loki tom hiddleston the villain of the previous thor 2011 movie appears and takes control of it in response col nick fury samuel l jackson in his usual badass self decides to form a small but lethal response team iron man captain america hulk black widow hawkeye and thor if they can get along and work together then they might have a chance to save the worldbeing the top billed character because of boxoffice receipts iron man robert downey jr gets the best lines and almost steals the entire show his wisecracks upends the traditional leader of the captain america chris evans playing the straight man to everyone else and puts the latter character in a disadvantage the movies lone weakness is that cap doesnt get to do much other than act as a foil to the larger than life tony stark thor chris helmsworth does shine in the few scenes in which he is at front and center while both hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson give much needed humanity since they are the only members of the team that dont have superpowers but the one character that makes the most impact of his limited screen time is mark ruffalo who plays the volatile hulk ruffalo plays bruce banner as a smoldering stanley kowalski always seemingly in control yet has a temper like nitroglycerine his banner is different from the brooding eric bana of 2003s hulk or the timid edward norton of the incredible hulk 2008 you dont get to see much of ruffalo compared to the others but his character is the most intriguing of all hiddleston is adequate as the pouty scheming loki but you cant help but believe that he is simply outgunned with all these powerhouses surrounding himthe movie is almost perfect but does fail to take chances with their characters evans captain america is a direct copy from the mainstream comic book but you wished he might have been given more of an edge like the ultimate marvel incarnation of captain america a slightly racist dogooder who prefers to smash heads when someone doesnt measure up to his 1930s morality if only the movie had been longer there might have been more insight into his character but with this film running over 2  hours it might have been a systematic onein the end though there is something for everyone in this movie from the constant action scenes to the quiet ones that add humanity to what would otherwise be cardboard clichs highly recommended,fantasy
from what i have seen this will be the greatest superhero movie of all time but i have a question that needs answering from anyone who has seen the film already does this film have an f word or a gddmn in it i have been waiting for this film since iron man in 2008 i hate that kind of cursing and i want to see this really bad the characters are deep and well acted the dialog is smart and clever the action is incredible and i dont want to not get to see it should it have those words in it captain anerica was my favorite of the marvel movies so far and so far marvel has managed to keep their movies clean relatively the incredible hulk had a gd in it and thats what worries me about this film i want my family to be able to experience this film and we cant should there be such words,fantasy
all i could think of as the end credits rolled was more please i would gladly have turned around and watched it againthe is not a deep thinking film you will not leave the theater enlighted or confused it wont cause you to rethink your world or your ideals it wont be a debate provoking film amongst your other intellectual friends but it will leave you thoroughly entertained those who are not of the genre will call it mindless banter and scoff at it those who are ok with being transported temporarily to a place where they can forget everything for 2 12 hours and just enjoy it they will love itthe previous movies have given substance background and depth to the characters most of them they feel familiar and make sense the story line is simple and predictable evil returns wants to enslave earth team of superheroes assembles and drive evil away or do they stay through the ending credits trust meits not the super story that keeps you glued to your chair it is everything else somehow you are not the slightest bit annoyed or care for the predictability of the story i dont think a better director could have been chosen for this film joss wheddon has just the right amount of childhood wonder still in him to recreate something magical  it was like watching the coming book come to life please tell me there is a sequel,fantasy
quite truly this is a film that makes your mouth water while watching it the man and the character that steals the film is hulk played mark ruffalo he adds this unique stint to the character commonly known to be scary ruthless monster he actually has the best comedy bits in the whole film we all thought iron mantony stark would provide the humour in the film he does but i feel he was casted down to be more of a super hero you will understand what i mean when you watch it this brings me to the point would the iron man and movie franchise be any good without robert dwoney jr he is truly an incredible actor that is so suited to the character of tony stark i dont wanna say anymore and i am so damn tempted to give away a couple of spoilers but i have to resist to let you enjoy this fabulous movie go watch it,fantasy
i just watched 2 hours ago and i personally dont think lives up to the hype it has got is it a good movie thats a definite yes from my side anyone whos into action movies and who knows these characters would enjoy the movie but for people who dont really know much about these characters would get a little bored and might find it hard to follow as it happened with my friends 10 of us went for the movie 3 people though it was hard to follow also one should know they are going for an action movie action sequences are awesome dialogues are ok not exceptional but ok they have tried to make the movie funny but there are only like 3 laughs out loud moments with 2 other that makes you smile interestingly enough hulk was in 3 out of 5 of those moments iron man is funny but now wow funny thor looked very ordinary in the movie his acting was ok not wow captain america looks a little misplaced among the super powered people and sadly black widow has a lot more say in the movie than does captain america hawkeye got his moment to shine but isnt as focused as one who expect hulk and loki their acting stood out of course loki being the main villain gets the most to do and hulk was the funniest among them all after he transforms minor spoilers its nice to see hulk finally learn how to control his transformation although how he learns it is never shown there are few plot holes in the movie we dont really understand how hulk from being a raging uncontrollable monster because a hero all of a sudden and decides to fight for the nick fury doesnt get to do much apart from blow up a helicopter captain america has some fights scenes before loki brings his army but later captain america didnt really play a big part in the movie at all aliens were below par they didnt even spend time with the aliens and they looked more like mindless beasts following command from their master who is shown post credit and will not be named for the purpose of this review there are no twists and turns in the movie the story could easily have been summarized in few lines as loki  world domination  army  assembles  gets his arse handed to him action scenes were awesome and its a very action heavy movie i hope i have not spoiled anything for you because i dont really wanna get into details of how the movie actually plays what i truly believe is you will not be bored watching the movie but its not something as amazing as say the dark knight,fantasy
marvelsa well paced movie that delivers from the beginning its hard to review this awesome movie without give some spoilers but ill try to do my best promisei tried to keep my expectations low about this movie before it came out because watching this all star cast playing the superheroes is exciting itself you have to add samuel l jackson as nick fury and a very good cgi work pumped up by a big amount of money but i have seen a lot of movies with great casts and high budgets going down cough batman and robin cough so i decided to stay calm and not to get hypedso the movie started with a very decent action scene that sets up the whole plot fast and effectively even when i tried to forget what this was about i couldnt help myself and i was sold after the ten first minutes why because you cant help it you get to go in deep with every main characters motivations the action never stops growing and the tension last until the very last minute its impossible not to fall in love with movies like this every relationship between the superheroes are well established and when the moment comes it showswhat are they avenging spoiler its hulk well done in this movie hell yeah finally its tony stark above the rest of nope hes part of an awesome teamis this movie worth to see on cinemas oh please oh please dont miss it watch it at least once 910 at the same level of the dark knightcons didnt like the 3d  black widow should have kept her long hair for the rest no complains,fantasy
since the dawn of men we aspired to be heroes we told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in legendary battles stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress since the 20s of the last century some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels two of the people who did this were stan lee and jack kirby at marvel comics the created among others the rich genius in a flying suit called iron man the super soldier called captain america a new version of thunder god thor two spies under the names black widow and hawkeye and of course the man that turns into a big green angry monster which calls itself hulk comics like this were made into movies but nearly all of them had some flaws they werent like the comics took themselves to serious made to much jokes or had some other flaws now a pretty unknown director takes a few famous heroes of marvel see above and makes a movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made the story itself is about heroes with flaws who need to grow together as a team so they can save the world from a mighty attack from other world if you like stories of heroes and strange folks you should go see this movie its not perfect but very close being perfect,fantasy
this was one hell of a mindblowing fantastic ensemble i entered the theatre with some trepidation dont get me wrong i love joss whedon his firefly dollhouse really impressed me with their thoughtful insights to complex subjects and excellent stories with witty dialogs but this being a superhero movie with characters so diverse i suspected this may just be a mashup of said characters with some good battles with whedons trademark oneliners boy was i stumpedthis movie never failed to keep my mouth open with shock and sheer awe at what i was watching also laughter this was a movie i will not forget or be satisfied with watching only oncewitty dialogs punctuate every minute every one of which are neither clichd overdone or badly timed but humour is only part of its brilliance as story too is pretty good with some amazing some awesome some sad and some thoughtful moments the movie is very well paced so much so that i barely realised the 140 minutes passing bythe casting was perfect with all the characters coming over from their respective movies except bruce banner who was now played by mark ruffalo taking over from ed norton in the hulk movies bruce was a scientist struggling with his inner demons threatening to release his darker greener alter ego but here he needed to be confident funny witty smart which was seriously downplayed in the 2 hulks to have any chance against such powerful characters mark ruffalo carries his character with remarkable panache and delivers a memorable characterthe rest of the cast were amazing robert downey jr as tony the self loving arrogant and oversmart playboy chris hemsworth as thor the regal guardian come to stop his brother in his tracks chris evans as the outofplace hero who tries to fit in scarlett johansson as black widow who has a substantial role to play not just eyecandy though she delivers plenty of that too jeremy renner as the stoic and unshakable hawkeye and of course samuel jackson as the enigmatic commander nick fury tom hiddleston on the villainous side is amazing as the nihilistic egomaniacal loki who is now stylish confident and devious in contrast to his thor persona where he is more childish in his harried quest for revenge every character is given a major role with noone sidelined or underused all these characters from different eras locations and occupations are blended beautifully though not without conflicts which are highlighted as a major plot point this was a much better idea than merely bringing them to save earth and explaining away these differences which any other director would have easily donethis brings me to joss whedon with spielberg giving us mediocrities like tintin indiana jones and war of the worlds this comes as a respite from old and boring directors who have been ruling bigbudget screenspace for far too long with xmen first class bringing forth matthew vaughn this too will bring whedon to the limelight and hopefully spur producers to give this underrated talent more opportunitiesthis has been my movie of the yearso far and the best superhero movie i have ever seen batman does not count to me as a superhero movie which is why this wins the title,fantasy
you certainly wont get over by the awesomeness of the movie when you come out of the cinema for hours  i watched 2 back to back shows  its damn fuking osum well the story is not any dark knight with complexities  its simple and straight forward  we have loki who has allied with an alien race for invasion of earth versus thewell keeping it short  its by far the best marvel superhero movie till datebest scene of theloki  i am god hulk  dhammm dishummm thanggg beating the hell out of loki loki  o o priceless expressions,fantasy
the is the best summer blockbuster for a long time it balances all elements of fun drama action special effects multiple egos into a well directed paced movie the film has perfectly edited action set pieces no fast editing like say transformers and it benefits hugely the first 30 minutes are fairly slow build up but after that the last hour especially is amazing credit has to go to the director you really can tell he has a love for the source material and gets all the characters to interact and each share their own moments throughout the film the drama is not as dark as say the dark knight as people have been saying it is a very funny film with some laugh out moments the is simply amazing hollywood is in for a bumper year this year with so many high profile releases yet to come the dark knight rises spiderman skyfall the hobbit the has started the summer blockbuster season with a bang and may end up being the best of them all in 2012 i highly recommend the,fantasy

these marvel comics obviously have a lot of fans and apparently whatever it was that fans and many nonfans were looking for in a marvel film was fulfilled here explaining the huge internet buzz the vast amounts of money this has made and its current spot in the top 50 films of all time on the internet movie database this movie does have expensive looking action and some comedic bits with lots of superheroes but what its missing ispretty much everything else the plot is uninteresting and quite honestly stupid and nothing really is driving this story along at times to me it grew boring because there was nothing to get excited about besides action big stars and comedyafter norse god loki steals the powerful potential super weapon tesseract from the peace keeping shield agency and mind controls a few people nick fury samuel l jackson puts together a team of superheroes known as the made up of iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson and eventually hawkeye jeremy renner loki is in cahoots with a group of aliens called the chitauri and plans to help them take over earth the must stop fighting with each other in order to protect the earthcan they do it or will the earth be destroyed take a guessdirector joss wheddon known for his work on television series does a fine job with the direction when it comes to action the big action scenes are appropriately frenetic and they look big and shiny i appreciated that the action scenes were spaced apart from each other also as to not overkill the action like the transformers films the fighting scenes between the was a bit overkill however half the movie is them disagreeing with each other or tony stark being snarky with everyone these scenes dont really have anything to them either they arent exciting they are meant to be funny but oftentimes comes off as more infantile in the humor department than anything else they further the plot along only in that the plot cannot proceed until these guys stop fighting these scenes are supposed to work as character development but its almost unbelievable how stupid these guys are and how unwilling they are to put their differences asidethe middle of the movie takes place on a ship with the angry at each other and this whole section of the movie just meanders you could say that this part of the movie gives us the character conflicts and whatnot which it does but the dislike of each other could have been introduced in something more important to the plot instead of practically stopping the plot to have these guys get angry at each other and thats really the movies biggest problem is the plot theres never really a feeling of dread or that something bad could happen and its hard to care about anything thats happening thats not to say watching tony stark bantering isnt amusing or watching bruce banner go insane as the hulk isnt interesting but nothing ever truly feels at stake when the film decides to kill off a character to add some level of emotion and serve as a reason for these heroes to stop their childishness it doesnt work on an emotional level it comes off as a cheap way to further along the plot the has some good elements to it its got a lot of charisma in the cast and each character is given enough screen time i suppose the action scenes are satisfying mostly and some of the comedy isnt bad while some does come off as a bit corny and pandering to the audience the problem is the plot where the villains never really come off as menacing despite possessing a super weapon and a main villain is loki who is about as threatening as a teddy bear theres nothing to the film and nothing to really love about it unless you are a big fan of these actors the comics or explosions theres very little below the surface of the film and without a good plot to move this along weve essentially got one long origin story apparently many have fallen in love with this though so if you like your movies big dumb and full of buff dudes youll probably like this one quite a bitmy rating  12 out of  140 mins pg13 for action violence,fantasy

just saw this movie yesterday at a local cinema and i was only mildly entertained after seeing itto be honest i was quite disappointed not to see edward norton reprising his role as dr bruce banner in this movie but after watching mark ruffalos satisfying performance as the emotional and impulsive alter ego of the withdrawn and reserved physicist i was pleased with the end result of hulks castingoverall i felt that it achieved its purpose as a funfilled action packed witty superherothemed movie kudos to director and writer joss whedon for a wellbalanced character development among all the heroes giving each of them their deserved screen timeon the downside the jokes and witty banters among the superheroes didnt bode well with me personally because i felt that it was mostly out of place and tiring to see tony stark with his usual iamironman andicansaysomethingsmartandyouwilllaugh routine the movie also failed to properly address the consequences of such a huge number of superheroes destroying many buildings and lives of ordinary civilians in their quest for battling evil like its dc rivals the dark knight a benchmark ive set for all superhero movies did back in 2008 not to mention the first 30 minutes of the movie was quite a drag and not enough to maintain the attention of an average moviegoer also the inclusion of a weak villain like loki and a new race of chitauri aliens unsuccessfully made the plot more interesting as it is evident that even thor or hulk could easily defeat loki in a matchultimately the movie was quite forgettable with its main role as a summer movie blockbuster typecast,fantasy
when i first heard about the i must admit to getting excited although i had my doubts im a big fan of the spiderman trilogy love iron man at least the first one and could even enjoy thor being from sweden who wouldnt right thor was definitely best served hung over and gave me exactly what i expected the did not i dont know where to begin with this movie its just one of those where you die a little inside every time a punchline is delivered alright samuel l have earned his right to do just that but the rest of them have not its extremely predictable you see everything coming from miles away if youre expecting a great story you would do best to rethink your choice of movie there is way to many heroes the story becomes a messy tangle of too many stories and the only one making me laugh is stark iron man also they all seem to have the same strength all of a sudden dont get me wrong im not one of those guys getting annoyed by the impossibility behind superpowers but this is absurd all and all this movie is an orgy in special effects and superpowers and nothing more,fantasy
first off you have to be naive way beyond pollyanna to think that the orgasmically hyperbolically glowing reviews were not churned out by a pr machineits getting easier to decide what makes a flick great or not i was just rewatching nights of cabiria and its a great case for how a rock solid story and laboroflove direction more than compensates for flaws in other areasthe problem with is that its a hollow conceptmyth ginned up with some admittedly clever writing and cgi the difference is that to me the writing and production dont compensate for a lousy core plot linethe classic deus ex machina resolves inextricable gotchas in plot development in the deus ex machina is the villain introduced at the beginning to set the plot in motion and give the writers a reason to get up in the morning loki touches people with a weird stick and they magically become his partisans how lame could a plot point possibly be i will again mention that once forces contrive to bring our good guys into some kind of alliance the writing is remarkably good even enjoyablebut i have to mention a few more of my personal bugaboosfirst off being a sort of closet discordian my ears prick up when a troublemaker god is maligned loki as an evil nemesis strikes me a bit incongruous i like troublemaker gods they keep us on our toes and keep us from devolving into protoplasmic sludge i dont like seeing the glorious tradition of troublemaker gods as agents of change being blasphemed like thisnext look at lokis statement of intent he wants to take away our freedom thereby making us free why do i feel like im watching dr evil ask for one million dollars all over again dont the writers know that human beings have been giving up their freedom to become free as long as there has been civilization are you in a relationship in which youve abdicated your principles for the short term gain of freedom from abject loneliness are you locked into an economic system that takes away more and more of your freedom havent you already internalized the view that this kind of enslavement is freedom dont you pay taxes so that bombs can be dropped on benighted wedding parties full of men women and children who havent yet bought into this precise species of freedom the loki of this flick is laughably and lamely late to the game you can see its difficult to get behind the ensuing sturm und drang when theres nothing truly relateable at stake on the table in play btw revealing this info isnt a spoiler its the beginning point of the plot not a revelatory middle or endpoint,fantasy
im 14 years old the perfect age for superhero moviesi loved the batman trilogy liked the iron man movies and ahh what the spiderman movies where okay i guess when i heard the was coming to the theaters i was going nuts i liked every superhero movie but the no boring unnecessary complicated story and almost no action why is everybody so thrilled about this movie go watch something real fun with a cool story im pretty disappointed i hope the 2 will be betterim sorry for the bad english,fantasy
this movie is absurdly nonsense and here are the reasons 1 in samuel l jacksonchris evans first scenethe most cheesy line the world is full of forces you cant control 2mark ruffalo miscast as hulk 3 worst director choice joss whedon who doesnt clean up the mistakes in the movie 4 bad writing the whole story puts boredom and annoyance on your head taking place in that big obvious cgi plane thing and at last 15 minutes yes enjoy cgi glory with fight 5 the fights sequences were also lame because they were stolen from transformers series like that big beast thing and the light that goes up in skyseen it all in transformers 3 which is also not that great movie 6 it is just nonsense talk all over the movie 7 some scenes are just the most cheesy like captain america giving 10 for showing the big cgi plane thing robert dowry picking up lines like that man playing galagai mean what does it add to this movie 8 also at last scene hulk guy comes on the bikemost cheesy st ever 9the pacing of the movie is absurd 10 hawk eye guy says dialogue like it is my genuine pleasurei mean the world is about to come to an end and you are saying this  11 the police guards talks on the street one said we need soldiers or some st and says what is happening and the other says do we knowcome on even policedialogues were the most annoyingly cheesy 12 i dont buy captain america suddenly becomes a leader and gives orders  13 i also hated that black widow character 14 even in the scene with loki in that thingshe tries to get answershow by cheesy lines of course 15 i didnt even buy how she figured out loki had a plan to separate these peopleeven in that scene he denies it 16 the concept annoyed me that how they even thought that they could cash out on gimmicks like having some heroes in movie that concept annoys methere are more things that i have not addressed but for my sanity i dont feel to lose my consciousness to rant about such a thing that doesnt matterif you are a parent then dont let your kid watch this movie or any other like this because it makes your kid stupid after a while fair warningi understood about the kids but the adults and older adults think that this is a good moviebaffling truth good luck transformers 2 lovers and son of the mask lovers and meet the spartan loversyou will enjoy this more,fantasy
if youre going to rate marvels the by how much cgi was fit into its mere 143 minutes than give it the highest rating you can otherwise this movie was nothing more than a huge headachealso i am a huge comic book reader and fan of the original comic books but i wasnt breathtaken at all whatsoever this movie was just a bore let me tell you whyif your protagonists cannot be harmed then wheres the thrill thor is the god of thunder and with that title also comes a fact hes immortal the hulk can be shot at with anything and still bounce out of the dust and smash st captain america has his magic shield that can be hit by thors hammer and not receive a single scratch no really if you watch the scene the paint doesnt even get scratched iron man is iron man his suit can be broken but he has a million gadgets that can get him out of any trouble hawkeyes character in this film was nothing the could have lived without him black widowshes just a chick with a gun if you read the actual black widow comic books preiron man the protagonist doesnt wield guns but giant blasters on the top of her hands which shock enemies to the point of paralysis called stings yet they managed to turn her character into an irrelevant outcast that just stands out like a sore thumb and last time i checked black widow wasnt even originally in the the originals were thor iron man captain america and spider man who thought it was a good idea to put her in this movie sorry but her character was cardboard lets also discuss the fact that the group stayed on a friggin flying carrier boat for a good 57 minutes of the movie i mean it really feels like it when youre pulling your hair out and praying to anything holy that something will actually happen if youre a real fan of these characters and youve spent a huge portion of your life reading about them then please out of respect for their original creators please watch the movie and actually visualize what the hell is going on screen before leaving a 10 star review saying that this movie was visually surpassing or it was perfect in every way as far as i know this films only good aspect was that it was sometimes pretty and it can entertain a drooling infant 310,fantasy
im not really a comic book fan so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years i really wasnt too fussed when it finally appeared on tv i went into it expecting not to like it much and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best some mildly lame comedy a whole lot of posturing and a silly storyline involving silly charactersthen things changed they started to pick up and the action started hitting home then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour an hour packed with kaijustyle mayhem as new york found itself subjected to an alien invasion and i was wowed never before has it been possible to depict such constant widescale mayhem but with the improvement of cgi technology its finally up there on screen with all of its gloryand yes i ended up liking marvels assemble whats not to like really the whole feel is kept light and there are so many largerthanlife characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless mark ruffalos hulk is my favourite character by far  ruffalo is far better suited to the role than eric bana or edward norton  but chris evanss captain america comes a close second sure i see this film for what it is a mindless piece of crowdpleasing overblown cgi mayhem replete with a silly buffoonish bad guy  but at the same time i cant help but getting caught up for the ride,fantasy
when we observe a supporting character a mere mortal  a defenceless humanbeing in joss whedons marvel assemble decide to singlehandedly take on a nearindestructible son of a god purely so as to come to the aid of a second son of god who is trapped inside a glass box although has at his disposal a large hammer and indeed pays for it with their life you know youre not mining particularly intelligent territorythis largely disappointing 2012 effort begins in a quasiarea 51 style military base where a mysterious blue cube is pulsating enough for a race of monsters who dress like the creatures in stargate but look like something you might have caught in an episode of power rangers located on the other side of the universe to be attracted to it like stargate although with the roles here reversed tom hiddlestons loki turns out nordic mythology was the one true religion emerges from a portal created by the cube into this top secret laboratory and steals the cube in order to fabricate it so that the rest of the war mongering creatures can come through at a later date to destroy all human lifea measure as to his menace and ability is put across in two ways first the ease to which he neuters the human beings  finding no threat in automatic weaponry and converting them to his cause through a magic staff second the way in which he is framed so as to encompass an eaglelike emblem in the background actually the badge of the good guys as he utters freedom is lifes great lie  something designed to invoke a hitlerlike personality with what resembles the german national adler behind himlater on there will be a strange allusion to nazi germany again when in germany of all places he forces a score of german citizens to kneel before him with one brave citizen standing up and making some allusion to how there will always exist people like you people who want power had it been me i would have cited a very famous remark actually made famous in the twentieth century by a communist which goes its better to die on your feet than to live on your knees had i still been in one piece to offer a further retort i would have recommended he hop on over to the middle east where theyre heavily into sprawling themselves out on the floor because a deity tells them to lokis philosophy on human existence essentially being one of desiring submission would be right at homebut nobody watching marvel assemble will know of anything about german life between the wars nor will they have heard of the versailles treaty nor that hitler commanded not for people to kneel before him merely salute out of respect and recognise that his policies had made germany a nation that was rich enough to fool itself into thinking the great war never even happenedafter lokis theft an otherwise needless character played by samuel l jackson whose purpose in the film is to look cool wearing an eyepatch and firing a bazooka gets together a string of superheroes whom have each had their own blockbusters from as recently as 2008 these are the titular although what they are avenging we do not know and the films title card appears on the screen as if itself a response to a characters asking what do we do following lokis theft of the cube doomsday device given this the film ought to be entitled assemble the tossed in is an archer and an expert in kungfu because they offer an alternative way to kill an enemy to the main heroes who can do nothing more than keep blowing them up or swatting them away with their powerthe film is mostly noise but good looking noise made more bearable by the wonderful editing during the action sequences particularly when a flying battleship loses its ability to fly midair and new york city is besieged during the finale wherein it is clear what each of our protagonists are doing where they are in relation to each other and how they are going about fulfilling their tasks amidst the elements the film is essentially superman ii with multiple supermen a concoction of 1994s street fighter wherein each character is designated a fight with every other one despite some of them being on the same side with stephen norringtons damp 2003 squib the league of extraordinary gentlemeni dont mind action films but action films with a great deal of special effects are often somewhat tiresome affairs this 2012 feature is no exception here over the last 25 years hollywood has proved time and time again that the best action films carry with them that grounded sense of baselevel operation being propelled by realistic heroes this is why the street highway and innercity set event movies of a speed or a die hard with a vengeance will always be superior to a marvel assemble films that do not rely on a tremendous amount of special effects but provide you with enough chase pomp and bullettime to have you feel as if you are caught in a crossfireshould be unfortunate to catch this good looking although ultimately vacuous 2012 feature i sense you will be disappointed i was left dissatisfied in being asked to believe that there could exist a form of authentic theism and the existence of an alien species elsewhere in the universe without any of it being explored left perplexed at the tremendous amount of science on display in iron mans suit and bruce banners fascinating ability to shift into a separate molecular form  the likes of which essentially smashes the concept of creationism it is harmless inoffensive and does indeed fly past nicely but theres nothing here to get excited about,fantasy
i watched this without knowing anything about it at allsome people argued some people shouted back at them then some other people chased some other people then they all had a fight then had to make some decisionsthen a load of monsters and superheroes turned up then all of the same things happened again but with the superheroes involved this time and with explosions too and more fighting it seemed to be over something importantthen one of the teams won which seemed to be the right result looking at the people i was watching it withi had a feeling i had seen this or a similar story in something once when i was a kid but everyone else who watched it with me seemed to be interested so should keep the kids amused for a while,fantasy
this movie is super hero cinematic excellence it has one of the greatest ensemble cast ever assembled every actor complimented each other so well and each played their respective roles gracefully robert downey jr was funny and portrayed the classic tony stark that he did so well in the previous iron man he maintained all the cockiness and swagger that he had previously mark ruffalo was a much better hulk than expected he did better than edward nortons portrayal in the previous film he was very intellectual and benefited the movie well chris evans was the perfect leader for this heroic crew he had great oneliners throughout hawkeye and black widow were both good compliments to the the team also all around great movie that you can even take the kids to see,fantasy
i found after each scene there needed to be something interactive to do and if you were to glue lots of video game cinematics together you would get something quite similar to this movie ie you would have no flowi found the storyline quite shallow the character introductions unnecessary and the whole experience was rather disjointed to me i also hate movies where i need to adjust the volume throughout the movie unlike the dark knight for example which probably has one of the tightest mixes for an action movie this one was all over the place quiet dialogue and extremely loud action sequences the music was suitably dramatic but not especially memorable comparing it to similar movies i would rate the a little better than the fantastic four but nowhere near as good as the xmen movies,fantasy
i know its not as bad as i want to make it because it is a good time consuming movie but it lacks what batman has a really scary and evil villain will he be revealed in the 2 i hope so if not well then this was a waist worst part of the whole movie is making the incredible hulk turn into nothing but a clown why did you do thathulk should not be laughed at he should be respected iron man saves the movie so i would call this movie gay porn on steroids we can only hope that the next big movie man of steel will thrill us as it should general zod is back dbut it was still entertaining and i will see it a third and 4th time,fantasy
the is an okay superhero movie thats it a great deal of the problem is that there are too many characters at once the viewer doesnt get any time to understand most of the characters backstories or motivations they are suddenly called up for duty to defend the earth against the scrawny and mysterious alien supervillain based off of a norse god most of the superheroes were not interesting as their personalities were not that welldeveloped the exception to this is iron man who is wonderfully played by robert downey jr iron man is depicted as a wealthy sarcastic playboy who isnt necessarily a hero for altruistic reasons the smarminess and smugness of iron mans character may turn a lot of people off but hey at least its a character there are a few scenes where the hulk is really funny but that is only as the hulk persona rather than as bruce banner the rest of the superheroes are bland and undeveloped as characters the film is also confused as to its tone it tries to take its superhero world seriously like the tim burtons batman but also adds in tongueincheek humor and makes attempts to be selfreferential and campy like the joel schumaker batmans the balance is uneven at best the films characters with the exception of the incredible hulk do not have enough fame or notoriety like that of superman batman or spiderman to be familiar to a general audience this film is catered to an audience intimately familiar with the marvel comics universe and all of its characters which will leave an uninitiated viewer utterly clueless about whos who who the heck is black widow nick fury why do thor and loki speak in a bizarre overlyproper form of english is it because theyre aliens why should we careit is merely a personal matter of taste but cgi has not evolved to the point where the special effects look entirely real the closest computer animation has gotten to being realistic is james camerons avatar where the aliens have genuinely human expressions and movements the cgi in the is ugly to look at particularly the ship the use as a home base as well as the alien invaders towards the end it is not worth it to pay extra for 3d glasses to watch grey ugly aliens riding grey ugly spiny snakes while emerging from grey ugly bland modernistic monstrosities that pass for alien spaceships the ultimate irony is the cheap gorilla and diving suit from robot monster havent seen the movies just stills looks more creative and inspired than the effects in this movie the point is that there is little color and beauty in the cgi and it always looks more fake and lifeless than rubber puppets or furry ewok costumes ever could i would go so far to say that the greyness and blandness of the alien and flying fortress design totally detracted from the power of the action sequences notwithstanding the distracting cgi the action scenes as stand alone pieces are engaging and entertaining to watchin short the lacks interesting characters and while not entirely the fault of the filmmakers technology still has a long way to go in 2012 before anything approaching realism can be fully realized so my criticism in unfair in that respect the cgi wasnt pleasant to look at watch the for the action scenes and for hulk and iron man who are funny and interesting its a fair effort but nothing that approaches a timeless action classic at least the christopher reeve superman movies were infused with tongueincheek humor and had an undeniable camp value the takes itself too seriously to become a nostalgic classic like superman,fantasy
im a huge fan of comics and when a movie is made i need to see it no matter the number of stars it gets or the budget everyone talked about this movie like its something huge but im not so impressedthe actors were great but for an action heroes not enough actionthe first hour and a half was just a torture with mindless talk and few fights fought in darkand the end was similar to the ending of iron manthe same going in the high altitudeand free fallingi mean you have that massive budget and you couldnt come up with something differentbut the ending is only one of the many things that could have been made differentlyjust a little more imagination and less effectsstill the star wars stand unbeatable,fantasy
dont get me wrong i truly believed that this movie was great but the epic finale was a complete transformers 3 rip offlets see1 bad guys has a device that opens a portal to even more bad guys 2 the bad guys invades a city with small robots transformers or monsters 3 the also have a huge robot or monster 4 we get a gorgeous epic battle throughout the city with fun cgi very similar to each other 5 the heroes tries desperately to close the portal which they of course succeeds withits a lot of fun to read how michael bay make shitty films and that joss whedon is godboth movies are great and ridiculously similar,fantasy
i was able to experience the mania it was a fun filled movie robert downey as iron man was a treat to watch chris evans as captain america was exciting chris hemsworth as thor was good but felt he was little overshadowed but loved to see thor though and hawkeye nick fury and black widow were good in their rolesmark ruffalo emerged to become the best among the excellent portrayal of drbrcue banner hulkon the other side i never felt loki to be a formidable opponent for thehe could have been a part of a team of baddies i felt the climax was resembling the transformers latest installment a rating of 87 for is kind of little overrated though it was a fun film the rating is quite highoverall mindless fun and excitement good to see our childhood heroes back into action on the same screen,fantasy
there seems to be a lot of hype about this movie so i went with a friend when it first came out sure it packed theaters but after seeing it two additional times with two other friends i come to the conclusion that its just an okay moviei understand a lot of people are going to say oh youre stupid this movie is great but at least hear me outlets get started with the special effects hands down some of the best ive ever seen in film giant aliens ripping apart buildings was pure awesome however i saw this movie only once in 3d why only 13 in 3d because the 3d was godawful it gave me a headache and being as it was done postprocessing it didnt look convincing not that 3d ever really doeswhere the movie falls short is the random times of corny clichd dialog and just downright bad acting at some points cobie smulders as much as i love her in how i met your mother was terrible her lines sounded scripted and she simply existed to try to add a more surreal element to the film basically overemphasizing how dangerous things werethe movie was far too long in my opinion i noticed kids in the theater starting to get fussy toward the middle of the movie because of how long it takes to setup the plot a lot of people were confused as to how the tesseract really worked and how it played a substantial part of the plot too much terminology for people to remember to be quite honest they should have skipped more scientific discussion in place of better character developmentthere really was little character development yes the team fought then they made up then they fought again only to come back and win thats as far as the character development goes if you watched all of the marvel movies the first hour is rather pointless simply because all it does is establish the background of the charactersthe action scenes occurred right toward the last 40 minutes and were well directed you felt at true sense of teamwork the biggest problem was no character except for ironman was in any real danger the characters felt like they were just nonstop combat machines and you never really feel a on the edge of your seat moment except for when stark disposes of the nukethe balance of drama and comic relief is nearly perfect tony stark of course was the majority of the comedyall in all the movie was fun to watch but i certainly wouldnt say its a cinematic masterpiece while the special effects and great cast of characters bring this movie to life it suffers with a dull plot that can leave you dozing off at a few points,fantasy
this movie was incredibly charming and exhibits some of the finest acting that i have seen in a good while robert downey jr is flat out amazing as iron man this movie is exactly what you would expect it to be prepare for high adrenaline and the crowd laughing a lot more than they should about the decent jokes throughout the movie i enjoyed watching it but it does occur to me that the blatant lack of a plot takes it down a few notches in my eye what these people did was create a movie that was just perfect for the american public clever but not smart shallow and just the right amount of repetitive oneliners to get my fellow moviegoers going very exciting movie however it felt like over an hour and a half of fighting and puns,fantasy
ok so you have marvels most iconic superheroes thrown together in a battle against giant creatures and evil bad guys  how may this concept fail lazy authors bad budget lame lovestories good to see that none of these problems are present here what you get is maybe just the best superheromovie of all timeconsider this you have had all back stories of the protagonists minus two who barely need one to be awesome and the movie just jumps right to the action of course there are some necessary findandfighttogether scenes but until the end credits roll you get it all good versus the bad good versus the good seriously awesome and good versus the bad versus the good  you better order some new pants during the show apart from spoiling too much which i really dont want to i have to tell you that the screenplay and the graphics youll see in the movie are topnotch all together and especially the nonsuperpowerheroes really shinetrust the dialogue trust the performance and last but not least trust the critics if you like these kind of movies you need to see this to die happyhint if you see this in a movie theater wait until after the final credits ,fantasy
after waiting a couple weeks i finally got to see the with my movie theatreworking friend yay i have now seen captain america iron man thor and the hulk battle loki and his minions from asgard as the latter try to invade new york city cowritten and directed by legendary tv icon joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer angel and firefly he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters weve grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the fourcolor world they inhabit and seeing it all in 3d is such an awesome experience oh and its great in also seeing hawkeye black widow and nick fury in tow really all ill say is you must watch the ps seeing cobie smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her how i met your mother costar alyson hannigan formerly a buffy star have traded stories of what its like to work for mr whedon how id like to be a fly on that wall,fantasy
i will try to analyze this movie from a different point of view than most of the critics do i went to see this movie without any expectations because of many favourable critics but i havent seen movies such as captain america hulk iron man thor and so on usually superhero movies are not my cup of tea and i find them rather childish and only focused on special effects and the same old redundant storiesthis movie is among the better superhero movies but its definitely not the big thing many people claim it to beon the positive side we have the great 3d effects that are really worth watching this movie in the cinema in comparison to many movies in 3d that are not quite spectacular and only try to raise the gross the graphics and special effects of this movie are flawless and of the highest modern standards thanks to an exaggeratedly high budget of coursebut there are other positive things to find robert downey jr does once again an incredible job and becomes a better actor in my estimation each time i see him in a new movie he is some kind of a slightly crazy but charming dreamer with a sense for romance and cool humour and incarnates the iron man in a perfect way mark ruffallo plays a rather calm and intellectual gentleman that becomes the hulk as soon as he doesnt control his anger his acting is also very authentic and grounded in this over the top movie these two actors really impressed me the most but tom hiddlestone as the egoistic avenger and half god loki and the great samuel l jackson as nick fury are also quite convincing while the other actors cant catch up with these four talented actorson the other side the story kicks off way too fast and if you dont know much about the marvel characters you will feel a little bit lost in the beginning its not quite clear who is attacking whom and why in the first couple of minutes but after that the pace of the movie slows down and introduces the different characters in a solid way in the case of the hulk or natasha romanov as she seems to be of russian origin her actual name should be romanova  its a pity that such a famous movie with such a big budget has this kind of stupid error the introductions scenes are amusing and entertaining while the presentations of captain america or the iron man are not very well thought out in my opinionon the other side the story of this movie is pretty generic and also predictable the movie also has some important length in the middle of the film as the superheroes are discussing on the giant airship the battle scenes in the end of the movie also get rather boring after a while and lack of diversity the ending is also too much of a common standard to truly impressin the end there are almost as many negative as there are positive things to mention but as the quality of the positive facts is quite elevated and a more important factor than the pure quantity and as this movie was almost very well entertaining me over a quite long running time with two little exceptions i may give a shyly positive seven points to this flick after all i might now try out the movies about hulk and the iron man who are my favourite characters in this movie and cant deny that this movie awoke some interest in me to dig a little bit further into the marvel world i have missed out,fantasy

scientist with a powerful alterego of well incredible size strength and endurancethere are several characters in this movie who demand their own signature moments of screentime and individual backstories which were primarily covered in the other marvel pictures all these elements must tie into the crisis at hand with a neat little bow on top of it all also vying for screentime is the flying fortress of shield an elaborate flying aircraft carrier ive never seen anything quite like it before in the movies points awarded for originality and making me go hmm as i watched our heroes venture into action on that aerial marvel fans will probably gobble the up with repeat viewings strong word of mouth and what will likely be high volume dvd and bluray sales for them the movie showcases in spades these superheroes uniting together in the same superhero film each superhero looks great and they certainly deliver the goods in terms of characterizations use of superpowers and superstrength as they battle dark forces sidebysidethe is a very busy film this film really is a superhero smorgasbord its ambitious in its approach as a piece of pop culture cinema how the film manages to balance all of its multiple components is a strong suit a movie like this could have felt like an enormous hodgepodge collage to the films credit all the pieces fit together rather nicely sure there are some loose ends that go in different directions thats okay the pendulums are set in motion for other story arcs in subsequent movies to follow the accomplishes this without becoming an incoherent mess if filmgoers havent seen the other films and if they dont plan to see an spinoff to see what else happens that is fine this picture is relatively selfcontained how many other films of this magnitude can pull that off while i enjoyed it i did feel this movie could not be more than what it is from my perspective it meets only the checkpoints heres what i mean do we see our marvel heroes together yes do they bicker and fight each other at first yes do they overcome their subcultural differences to work in tandem against the lokiwmdalien invasion threat yes are there a few good jokes and a stan lee the founder of marvel comics and cocreator of many of its characters cameo thrown in for good measure well funny you should ask   this film adaption of the was directed by joss whedon who is wellknown in fantasytelevision circles as the driving force behind buffy the vampire slayer 19972003 angel 19992004 firefly 2002 and dollhouse 20092010 given his track record and reverence for the fantasy genre he was a natural choice to head this film why he had not broken into bigscreen comic book film adaptions earlier is hard to say though a few years back he did try to bring dc comics wonder woman to the screen in a failed attempt he is clearly a storyteller who knows how to get his audience dialedin and he gives them exactly what they wantthough likable i personally found the merely satisfying and nothing more i know there are people who absolutely loved this film while i only liked it at arms length perhaps thats due to my own tastes and sensibilities again i felt this film only met checkpoints and it didnt do anything to exceed that thats okay this film will still be treasured by its fans and i still managed to have fun with it too,fantasy
to start with i new what to expect a lot of action involving hitech gadgets and weapons offcourse starkdowny jr was excellent among the with others acting tough and superheros unless theres an exception that is bannermark ruffalo when he was not the other guy i think it couldnt have been done any better then thislike the cast itself being heavy and the expectations and hype added it has to be presented with perfectionapart from the loud bangs and crazy clashes between the every other 5 minute which was quiet fun to watch indeed but the lack of story telling again over here kept me silent for a while and gaze only at the screen discovering in this case suddenly a stunt double instead of a black widowscarlett johanson now that kept me even more silent only later to learn the movie is full of errors here and there in the background but when the action in the middle is just to intense to observe the sides i know who caresi got bad seats btw the earlier reviews highlight the emerging and graphic part of the film which i must say were amazing and a lot of new stuff to seeto conclude in the end the movie is designed as a summer blockbuster with marvels best joining hands together and fighting the evil loki whos job is to make people obey and worship himso in the end a movie you would go to and enjoy from the start till the end only to walk out thinkingyeah we have advanced in terms of making actionscifi movie,fantasy
this film is one of the most overrated movies i have ever seen the movie is so bland and predictable and none of the characters are interesting or memorable the dialog in the movie is laughably bad the movies universe doesnt have any consistency to it what so ever like how agent coulson dies and ends up appearing in captain america 2 and the universe doesnt have any consequences to it what so ever and it isnt even fun or enjoyable it is just bland and dull it is one of the few movies i was so board and disinterested at that i fell asleep while watching it that is a rarity for me since i love film so much and i usually get sucked into movies that just shows how bland and forgettable this film is the film is so predictable i knew even before it actually started what was gonna happen i just hate how much people loved this movie i dont get it what is to like in this movie i hate big budget summer blockbusters that have no originality and this is the perfect example of that while i wouldnt say it is the worst movie of all time it is just the fact that it is so bland and forgettable makes me hate it more than hilariously bad movies like the room or samurai cop in conclusion this film is a buy the numbers action blockbuster that fails on so many levels it fails to be enjoyable funny and fails to have impressive effects and fails at the most basic fundamentals of film it doesnt have good characters and a good story,fantasy
this movie was very triggering it made me recall the times in my life where i saw movies that were not good the reason this was brought to mind was because this movie was not good other than as a sort of cultural abyss into which to stare and wonder how things were before the kind of debased species that would make this sort of movie slithered into existencedespite the fact that this movie isnt very good it has a lot of accomplished stars in its cast each of these unique stars brings to the film their own interpretation of a muted listless performance i felt samuel jacksons performance was especially so his listlessness seemed mixed with deep despair an existential disdain so consuming that even feeling disgust would be a comparative relief for himin the movie a lot of things flew around there were threats of violence there was all the drama youd expect in a mexican soap opera there was even an animatronic gwyneth paltrow joss whedon has ingested hollywoods gold and laid a truly magical egg,fantasy
i cant see what is so special about this movie it fails to make any interesting plot since there are about 8 main characters with their own stories but i expected that what is worse there is practically no plot at all in this movie all the facts are established in the beginning and nothing new happens during the movie tesseract is already discovered all heroes are what they are and dont change till the end it is boring how loki was saved why is he so evil how cpt america deals with the xxi century we dont know the whole plot is basically a chain of fights and battles with no surprises there is no twists at all horoes dont even have to find some weak spot of the monsters ironman just kicks their asses boring fx are fine but hey weve seen iron man transformers battle for la and its nothing original iron man was better spider man was a lot batter even fantastic four 2 was somehow more focused and surprising i am disappointed,fantasy
a whole bunch of supposedly clever dialogues more or less clichd lines some funny moments and lots of pointless banters among the lead charactersthe character interactions are sometimes amusing and more or less remind you of buddy cop movies from the years past only set in a scificg backgrounddisappointing and ridiculous action sequences in the same spirit as transformersin a nutshell its basically an extended version of iron man captain america and thor if you liked any of these past movies chances are youll like this one toofor me there have been and will be plenty of better super hero films,fantasy
ive been waiting excitedly to see this movie then i watched it tonight on 2d i had a huge expectation on it i really want to say wow awesome im impressed but i cant there is something missing the believable factor i think dont get me wrong the sound and the image played on the screen was super grand the most believable was hulk the rest of the gang performance just so so loki as the main enemy was so weak i dont feel him at all you know a good bad guy should scare you in a way makes you wonder what hes capable of doing but it fell flat tho as for the team well have a glimpse of their pasts i appreciate the directors effort to keep each of their own personality in a way while building the story but the way it was told just plain i know there are so many characters in this movie but come on no need too much conversation to show their egos how bout on body language aka act it was boring  i enjoyed the last 40 minutes but the rest oh please i giggled a bit but there is not much to remember apart from hulk and hawkeyes arms really we know how a superhero movie gonna end but surprising storyline wont be much to ask no,fantasy
i must confess that im not really a massive fan of the comic book movies i dont normally go and see them at the cinema but someone dragged me along to watch assemblethe plot is predictably simple with an alien enemy threatening security on earth this means that a team of superheroes are required to defeat the enemy the superheroes that are recruited include iron man hulk thor captain america hawkeye and the black widow the thing that i disliked about the film is the fact that i didnt really care whether any of the characters survived or perished there are plenty of funny oneliners in the style of the bond oneliners it also appears that the actors had a good time making the film scarlett johansson looks particularly good in a catsuit throughout the movie the guy that dragged me along to the movie absolutely adored the film so if you are into comic book movies im sure youll have a blast,fantasy
the highest grossing entry in the marvel cinematic universe and one of the highest grossing films of all time this is good fun but rather disappointing i was hoping that the film would be as relentlessly enjoyable as xmen days of future past my favourite superhero film of recent years and my second favourite overall after superman however it never really reaches that the level that he could or should have that said it has quite a good script by zak penn and joss whedon and it is well directed by whedonas an ensemble film it does not offer the same opportunity for the actors to shine as they did in their solo films but that is understandable if again a little disappointing mark ruffalo replacing edward norton makes a very impressive debut as bruce banner a somewhat more neurotic character than in the incredible hulk in spite of the fact that he has far more control over the hulk than he did in that film there was certainly a sense of inner conflict in the character but i think that this has more to do with ruffalos performance than the writing robert downey jr and chris hemsworth are as strong as tony stark and thor respectively as they were in their own films but chris evans appears ever so slightly wooden as steve rogers in comparison downey certainly gets the best material of the four of them which is unsurprising since he has the strongest and most interesting character scarlett johansson and jeremy renner are perfectly fine as natasha romanoff and clint barton but their characters are far from interesting and honestly made no real impression on me characters who can kick ass still need personalitiestom hiddleston gives the best performance in the film as loki who on this occasion is merely the servant of a far greater power hiddleston is clearly having a whale of a time with the role and he gets many of the best lines in the film samuel l jackson finally gets more than a few scenes as nick fury and is as badass as you would expect i did like the fact that they made him a somewhat morally ambiguous character they tried to give agent coulson a personality in the film but he is likewise not a terribly interesting character though clark gregg tries his best i would have liked to have seen more of stellan skarsgrd as erik selvig since he was one of the best things about thor but he was excellent in spite of his limited screen time the film also features nice appearances in smaller roles from alexis denisof powers booth jenny agutter and harry dean stantonthe film is not structured terribly well and i felt that it spent a bit too much time on the petty bickering between the characters in the first half it was a tad overlong in terms of the action sequences the attack on the hellcarrier and all the associated scenes are certainly the most exciting i thought that the chitauris arrival on earth was left too late in the films running time and even when they arrived it was not as exciting as i would have liked part of the problem that i had with them is that they are basically a faceless enemy i would have preferred to have seen more of the other or get a proper introduction to thanos i also wasnt too convinced by the ending the special effects are certainly spectacular throughout the film i loved the fact that the hulk actually resembled mark ruffalo in the face overall this is a fun superhero teamup film but i preferred all of the characters previous individual films,fantasy
i expected a lot more from a movie with such high ratings first of all right from the first scene i did not understand what was going on also this movie had way way too much talk and i couldnt even understand or hear what they were saying i almost yelled at the movie screen for them to speak clearly all these random things started happening and i began to lose track of the storyline as a result i fell asleep the first movie i have ever fallen asleep during and it was the when i woke up it was the last fighting scene the same thing seemed to keep happening over and over again so it wasnt really that exciting the only thing i got out of that movie was some of hulks jokes which were pretty funny and iron man makes you laugh too sometimes other than that it was only ok maybe its just that i dont like super heroes that much but i did expect a lot more,fantasy
maybe this movie deserves an oscar for special effects even though i saw better special effects when you have a real idea you dont need too much special effects perhaps this doesnt apply for putting on the screen a comics book performed by live actors forget about the middle eastern terrorists the terrorists come from space an undefined limbo space so that future visitors from some other planet not feel offended what further disappointed me is that this livecomicsonthescreen is not even patriotic and using a futuristic setup for making a mockery out of our way of life and our government shows a pitiful lack of class i marked it 5 only for its entertaining virtues yes it is quite entertaining  but what a parsec distance between its heroes and the ones of star wars,fantasy
while the other avenger films arent bad this one takes the cake because its smaller cast makes it easier to to get to know all the characters while in the later films it just throws in characters left and right and for those who havent seen every mcu movie its impossible to keep up with them,fantasy
checklistchemistry was greataction seen was greatplot was greatjust one note watch iron man iron man 2 and thor before this to get the idea of the marvel universe they are trying to create,fantasy
joss whedon was the right choice to direct this film because if somebody else took his place and directed it could have turned bad the is probably the most loved mcu movies of all time tones of people have supported it many years but to me it is one of my least favourite mcu movies i dont hate this film i just dont like it it is a bit boring even when the heroes are fighting in the last 30 minutes of the film where they fought those giant worms and aliens and do superhero stuff that weve seen a billion times in the past the best part about this movie is easily the villain loki was amazing in this film and if he wasnt great the film would have failed i wouldnt say this movie is terrible in fact it is no where near as being terrible this is actually the first ever live action comicbook movie where we see all the superheroes teaming up to save the universe and stop the bad guys when thor iron man captain america and hulk came together for the first time joss handled it well and i really loved it there are many iconic shots in the film that will never be forgotten my favourite shot in the entire film is when the are fighting together and the camera is moving to each character without cutting its all one shot also i really loved the music by alan silvestri i listen to it a lot and it never gets old it fits perfectly to the film and it was a massive achievement,fantasy
a little two much action and fast cuts for me if you have a short attention span this film is for you,fantasy
all of us deep down have something for superheros whether we grew up with them as kids or just really enjoy seeing them smash into stuff these mythical larger than life heroes tend to stay with us throughout or entertainment experiences and boy do they make a lot of money shattering multiple boxoffice records across the globe the is a marvel fans wet dream combining iron man captain america the hulk hawkeye thor loki and black widow to fight it out for hours the visual effects dont disappoint creating giant explosions that never seem to go away or have a direct cause with fun little jabs at each other these superheroes and villain end up causing a huge raucous that is consistently stupid and entertaining this is the kind of movie youll enjoy for a bit if youre not huge on superheros but will love if marvel is your thing the explosions and dialogue get a little out of hand but josh whedon knows what hes doing and he does it well,fantasy
one of the keystrokes of genius in joss whedons movie was how he managed to introduce the characters fast fun and without boring the old timers or losing the interest of the newbies i didnt know anything about thor captain hammer black widow hawkeye iron man or fury but i got them enough for the film i think thats one of joss strengths he did that in serenity as wellthe dialogue was amusing the pace fast and usually the objective clear its easy to see why this fun action movie made about a billion and a half at the box office and personally marvel characters arent really my favourites14 june 2013  1 out of 4 users found this review helpful,fantasy
i think the movie was good and they used great actors in it especially chris evens as captain america in my opinion he better as captain america than human torch because i like that he made captain america brought back from world war 2 era to the presentthe hulk was good as well in the movie my only bad thing is the hulk should of talked more in the fight scenes but everything else it was goodi like the idea of marvel making a cinematic universe based on modern era with marvel characters i think marvel should expand more with putting the characters from the tv series as well in the movies like for example daredevil and others as well and marvel should get the rights for spiderman to be in the cinematic universe,fantasy
the previous origins movies were significantly better than this blockbuster the characters are reduced to onedimensional caricatures and i am fairly certain some of iron mans dialogue is recycled from his own series of films the script is poorly thought out why is jane foster not recruited for her portal expertise how come thanos chooses to send loki to earth and why does loki even want to rule earth why does loki ever let his magical staff go why are the alien soldiers incredibly weak compared to the hype how did the astrophysicist somehow resist lokis mind control but hawkeye couldnt the jokes are groaners i am a god hulk smashes said god puny god and the premise is cheesy ragtag group of superheroes must put aside their egos to work together as a team that being said the action sequences are enjoyable enough to sit through to the end of this long 25 hour flick,fantasy
i mean this is not a bad movie but its definitely not one of the best 250 movies ever made lets be realistic it is not even one of the best superhero movies ever made people totally overrate it because of the nice visual effects audio etc but the plot is not that good and at one point it even becomes kinda dull lets hope more imdb users realize this so that the rating is lowered a little bit on the good side it does have some funny moments and the cast is good the mood is definitely a light one you can watch this movie at any occasion and is as we call it in mexico palomera which means you only watch it one time and just to pass the time,fantasy
i guess the was the movie many marvel comics fans were expecting finally after a series of solo movies a group of the fan favourite heroes were united under the tag ironman hulk thor captain america black widow and that guy with a bowthe would be hero team bickers a bit in the beginning as they are reluctantly put together to fight loki thors brother who is again trying to take on the world this time with a help of cube thingie called tesseract that opens a portal through which a some sort of biomechanoid warrior race runs through to do the actual conqueringin order to get the full impact of the movie it would probably be the best to know a lot about the marvel universe either from the comics or from the movies as the doesnt even pretend to be a movie friendly for new viewers its not muddled piece of fan service but it is filled with things that are left relatively obscure without prior knowledge of what has happened in the marvel universe the is fully watchable even if you dont know that much about marvels world but it does feel a bit hollow experience none the less it just cant escape from its roots which have been made during many other moviesas said the is not a bad movie its filled with great actors from samuel l jackson to robert downy jr almost all of which are familiar from the previous marvel movies thay all do serviceable roles they make the movie work but none of them gets huge amounts of time as people as the movie expects the viewers to be already familiar with them be it tony starks arrogance or bruce banners life in shambles caused by his alter egoall in all while the avengeres is not a perfect movie it is a nice start for a probably a lot more of them but i doubt any of them will be aimed towards people who dont already know what they are watching,fantasy
very few times are my high expectations overcome by even greater payoffs but definitely did that for me i for one think that it had a lot of action scenes and a few of them took a really long time but then again it was a really long movie so it also had plenty of time to develop plot and characters thankfully it allowed the movies to do a lot of the backgrounds for the characters otherwise we would have been in for an extremely long ridethe hulk was the standout character for me out of all of the superheroes in this movie he was by far my favorite and has been my favorite for a very long time joss whedon seriously knew how to make this movie into a fanatics wet dream and he held plenty of tension and plenty of drama in all the right places along with the kick ass action sequences though i would have liked ed norton to be the hulk in this movie the actor they picked for a standin was right on the money for a great bruce banner he was mildmannered smart and coolheaded well you know what i mean and the greatest parts were his action sequences by far i loved just about everything in this movie especially the cliffhanger at the end stay after the first round of end credits if youre a real marvel fan youll go yeeeeeah like i did in the theater this one is definitely for the marvel dvd collection,fantasy
when a 13 year old boy is supposed to be the worlds most frequent cinema attendant it makes sense that hollywoods summer blockbusters cater for immature audiencesfor an assembled cast to work each has to have a moment in the spotlight and after being subjected to an hour of banter that maybe a 13 year old would find witty the fight one another because lokis not a badarse enough villain to last a 2 hour film before they finally turn on him and his army of space alienswere i 13 again perhaps id think that this film did belong in the imdb top 250 but then again perhaps not id like to think notdont get me wrong for something to watch with a couple of mates if youd rather stay in for the evening the does what it set out to achieve entertain and make money but its the epitome of what has been dubbed the popcorn flick and once youve had your fill into the bin it goesbut then nobody ever expected a film about comicbased super heroes to be the godfather,fantasy
the is a great movie but not due to its plot its a simple macguffin chase culminating in a random big fight also the editing felt unfinished from time to timenevertheless its not the plot that is supposed to make the a great movie its the fact that it brings stories and characters from other movies together in a way the is the finale of a bigger wholethe lack of plot gives the opportunity to zoom into the different characters and how they respond to each other we learn how bruce banner and tony stark connect we see how the hulk and thor have a measurement of strength how the straight morals of captain america conflicts with the happy go lucky attitude of iron manwe also get a closer look at shield and we learn that the agency has its moral questionabilities when we move beyond the we learn how that is so in captain america the winter soldierthe choice for loki to be the main villain connects to the firs comic and in many other ways as well  the movie pays its respect to the comics  as were used to in the marvel cinematic universe mcu the movie is a mile stone in the mcu and yes its greatest merit is being the movieits not the plot that makes this movie great its the fact that its the payoff for earlier established characters and stories and laying the ground work for more great stuff to come,fantasy
i love the way marvel have brought captain america iron man hulk and thor together the plot is brilliant and i especially like the battle of new york scene where hawkeye black widow captain america iron man hulk and thor fight against loki and thanos armies in the middle of new york outside stark tower as it is full of action i also like the way although it is an action film there are aspects of a comedy film in it as i found some parts of the film funny it is one of the best films that i have ever seen and i really enjoyed watching it overall it is an exceptionally brilliant film that i would strongly recommend,fantasy
im writing this review in response to a lot of the backlash that seems to be happening in the reviews despite being the third highest grossing movie of all time receiving critical acclaim and being in the imdb top 250 people in the reviews have been slamming this movie why not dark and gritting enough i loved the dark knight but not every movie has to follow that formula see amazing spiderman man of steel no one said this movie was the godfather or citizen kane because it doesnt have to be all it has to do is entertain and it does that in bucketloads i remember leaving the theater and already i couldnt wait for the second one joss whedon is one of the greatest writers in the industry see buffy firefly etc and knows his comics see his run on astonishing x men and runaways making him the perfect choice for this movie it has action and humor and all you could want from a blockbuster movie granted it looks better on the big screen in which case this review is too late but none the less if youre a fan of blockbuster movies this is the cream of the crop if you arent then be smart enough not to go see it,fantasy
marvels the is six years in the making all starting with one of the first end credit scenes at the end of ironman and continued on to the incredible hulk ironman 2 thor and captain america the first avenger now the world is under attack by loki and an army of powerful aliens both fixed on world destruction shield look to gathering the most powerful team of superheroes from paramount pictures which brings us ironman captain america thor hulk black widow and hawkeye the is a awesome superhero movie and joss brought the movie to life so i believe that f you are a fan of marvel movies or a fan of superhero movies in general you will love this movie,fantasy
the success of the film is a result of the brilliant marvels history and its ideas the marvel universe has grown a lot since its beginning in the 1950s what started as a series of comic books would become one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world marvel has since expanded to explore mediums such as comic books of course short films feature films video games and a television series all based on characters from the marvel universe this process made the marvel to a big fantastic factory of dreamsthe is an example of film that the people know as transmedia because the sequence of the film happens in different media platforms like a game onlinea specific novel or graphic novel in comics form comic cartoon and film the process of adaptation is very important as well especially in this movie because this process becomes possible to work comic features specific in a film and vice versa the films idea was born from the adaptations of the comic book the ultimate this comic book gets a new form a book form that is the graphic novel this new forn brings a new meaning to the same textthe plot talks about the power cosmic cube this power is the cause a war and in the same time it is to threat a planets safety threat the cosmic cube is a specific object in marvels stories the concept was created by stan lee and jack kirby and first appeared in tales of suspense in july 1966 the power cosmic cube is important too because it transformed its holders any wish into reality here it becomesan inexhaustible source of power named tesseract which is under the power of shield strategic hazard intervention espionage logistics directorate organization led by nick fury samuel l jackson that seeks to protect the earth with the aid of the object the plan backfires when loki tom hiddleston thors brother chris hemsworth who was trapped in an alternative dimension returns there with the aid of alien chitauri and gets the cube to revenge the terrans and the god of thunder from there the feature engages in short stories full of action which serve to show the bonds that are formed between each hero before the formation of the there are the black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr hulk mark ruffalo agent maria hill cobie smulders and the other agent phil coulson clark greggfinally the problem with this film is your specific plot because for the marvel comic reader that ok but the occasional reader and lay person may some difficulty understanding the marvel universe for example the cosmic cube is a specific ficcional marvel comics object and this object is very important for many comic stories creations,fantasy
i do not read comics ive tried but they just seem like watereddown versions of the shows i watched as a kid like batman tas or teen titansbut i love cinema ive been keeping up with all the marvel movies released prior to the and they were always teasing at an movie and let me be the one millionth to sayoh my god this is the greatest movie ive ever seen in my lifeand what a movie it is it has comedy it has action character interactions drama everything a movie needs not just a comic book film any film but when you get down to it is a comic book that has been cleanly and perfectly translated to the big screenbut what sets apart from other movies is the mere fact that it worked every single character in this has been the leading man in their own movie or has the potential to be and yet the film focuses on them all its like if you got john lennon william shatner and george peppard to be in a movie together with vincent price as the villain and the story managed to revolve around all of themthe plot is unoriginal but thats not what carries the movie what carries the movie is the characters even the scenes with thor cap iron man and nick fury just talking are fun and engaging and no scene drags or is too fast and thats all this movie aims to be an overload of funwhy are you still reading this go rent the movie and watch it you fool,fantasy
i went to watch this movie in theater with my dad me my 2 brothers and my dad are huge marvel fans we enjoyed thor iron man 2 the incredible hulk and everything else when i heard of the i spread the word to my family and friends we watched the in a theater with my dad expecting the movie to be amazing since it has more marvel superheroes in onethis movie is the best marvel movie i watched the visuals blew me away the acting was what i wanted from the actors the humor was perfect and above all the story was magnificent i enjoyed the performances of robert downey jr chris evan mark ruffalo chris hemsworth jeremy renner and scarlett johhanson the way how they portrayed their characters was exactly what i wanted in a marvel movie this is very pgi recommend this to everyone who wants to see a funny thrilling and an amazing marvel movie,fantasy
marvels the is the crossover movie that everyone was waiting for all our favorite heroes iron man captain america the hulk thor black widow and hawkeye are in one movie in order to stop the evil loki and it is perhaps one of the most critically loved and successful movies and with good reason the movie is incredibly amazingfor starters the acting everything actor did a phenomenal job as their characters each actor robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo etc defined their characters so was the villain loki was completely evil and awesome the dialogue should also be addressed the dialogue was beautifully written for the characters and it seemed believable because they really werent friends that would be a spoiler but we all knew that would happen the action was the best ive seen in 2012 it was all shot well the oneshot in the last two trailers was the best scene in the movie with the hulk smashing thor using that cool hammer merica throwing his mighty shield it was christmas for moviegoersin the end what else is there to say that everyone else hasnt the is cinematic gold at its finest it was exciting it was humorous and it was just what 2012 needed for the summer movie season this is a feeling we dont get in movies these days four years of buildup paid for us in marvels crowning achievement marvels the,fantasy
the is one heck of a film its got loads of action and adventure with a bit of comedy thrown in their as well the casting was perfect as well robert downy jr as iron man amazing chris hemsworth as thor perfect samuel l jackson as nick fury great tom hiddleston as loki just wow he has definitely shown lokis sly and dangerous personality through his acting the special effects were brilliant especially during the battle at manhattan lots of explosions were their too the jatari lokis army looked great and a little bit freaky as well that is what you need to make a good evil alien army the comedy was effective especially after hulk and thor defeated the big um well alien thingy and then hulk just randomly punched thor out of the picture great i recommend this film to everyone especially for marvel fans and even for dc fans as well,fantasy
this a great movie it is very good this what happen when you take marvels greatest in one movie it was a long time in the making you have thor prince of asgard then there is also the strongest thing in the world the the incredible hulk the greatest spy in the world hawkeye and black widow one of the smarts men on the planet iorn man aka tony stark with captain america the frist avenger as there leader the will become the avenger the will work with shield with them there task will be to save the world it is about how a group of unlike heroes come together the team take a little time to get were they can get along in avenger it will not be that confusing if you have watch all of the movie up to this point it bring all the the past marvel movie of the last 10 years together they must face loki and save the world these movie is very good and fun to watch it let it let you see what it talks to be a hero because have power makes you a superhero but even without them you can still be a hero as you will soon see if you watch these movie if you dont believe me watch for your self i believe that you will enjoy it very much i will leave you with assemble,fantasy
the promotional material looked like it was setting me up for disappointment then i saw it and found myself uncontrollably falling deeply in love joss whedon was able to flawlessly bring these characters together and give them some excellent interactions a sign of his genius is how he took black widow my least favorite character from iron man 2 and made her one of my favorite marvel characters he was also able to give us the best portrayal of the hulk loki also had some great scenes and some great lines in fact i think he was the strongest element of this movie the music is for some reason quite average though this is a movie one can rewatch again and again its an all around enjoyable film with great unique characters great dialogue a cohesive plot and fantastic action at this point with its universal acclaim there is no point in me recommending it at all let me just add this then for once the hype is completely justified,fantasy
ah comic superheroes i used to read the as a kid it wasnt my favorite comic but i really got into the storylines that ranged from simple single villain battles to countrywide political issues teamwork was of the utmost importance and although most of the characters had their own comic series it dove into some meaningful character studies itself tooas for the movie you couldnt really ask for much more its got everything that an actionfantasy hell even comedy lover would want and then some assembling a team saving the world against evil while trying to cope with each other is just a lot of fun to watch each hero had some interesting story to them youve got the bulk brawn  cooped up anger of the hulk the out of time sturdy super soldier captain america the playboy geniusjoker ironman the arrogant but powerful  otherworldly thor  the russian shield agent black widow but not hawkeye nobody liked hawkeye so lets skip himtom hiddleston is better than he should be as badguy loki he and agent coulson played by clark gregg somehow became fan favorites i understand loki hes a bit of a tragic figure hes been damaged emotionally and physiologically by others  good example of evil but i dont understand agent coulson i mean i liked the guy but he has fan sites by gollydirector joss whedon was perfect for this hes a comic book lover  well established in epic like storytelling for tv shows and i havent even mentioned samuel l jackson as nick furydoes the movie have flaws sure but so does every other movie including the dark knight which had far far more head scratches  dumb plot holes than i could countregardless this is a must see movie for all fans of the genre,fantasy
i dont think i need to rehash the plot details with 1000 reviews before me in short the come together at first they dont like each other but they band together to save the world from aliens the technical gadgets and space craft were cool and looked great on the big screen however with so many main characters and so much action to fit in the funny quirky bits about each character were lost everyone got in a one liner but not much more than that i missed the heart pounding heavy metal arrogance of iron man the fish out of water grandeur of thor and even the mysterious plot line of captain america with all the fab reviews i must just have different taste in movies i felt less endless battles and more banter and purpose would have jazzed this up a bit i only bother to write review 1000 and something hoping that joss picks up on this and makes the next a bit more clever,fantasy
 is a flawed but still highly entertaining film i went in with pretty low expectations but was pleasantly surprised by its entertainment value however i think the real problem is not the entertainment value but the value of the story is inherently an origins story this is sort of confusing because it tells the story of numerous characters teaming up and forming an alliance the primary goal should seem to be establishing the characters their differences and why each would decide to form such a group as someone who saw only several of the previous set up films incredible hulk iron manthor i felt like i didnt learn much about the characters the inconsistency of both being an origin film but also heavily reliant on previous films to know who those characters are weighed the movie downthe movie kicks off with action yet it then slows down considerably with some lessthaninteresting introductions it might be silly to be asking for back story considering the popular nature of these iconic characters but it seems like this was the very basic requirement of the film who are theback story is glossed over for a few minutes for each character in expository dialog thor describes that he is the brother of loki captain america mumbles about some war and scar jo talks about some assassination attempt this would seem worthwhile if it was not so bland it is very dull hearing one ultra warrior after the next explaining themselves this would perhaps be less of an issue if the dialog was better written the only dialog that had some genuine wit and charm that every character seemed to be trying too hard to accomplish was with iron man the movie suffers from that guy needs a witty line too which makes the characters just a bunch of smarties this is a classic example of show dont tell being blatantly ignored loki while performed well was a villain who left much to be desired making snide and childish squawks about being better than everyone else is not enough we need to see it in action instead we have one character after the next smashing him and sending him through a wall while he insists on superiority while having the main characters more powerful than the villain is not always bad jokerbatman the villain needs an equalizer usually in the form of intelligence or ruthlessness while loki is certainly mean he is anything but intelligent loki suffers from why didnt he do that in the first place the entire movie one wonders why he sought to divide the when they were already divided one wonders why he would stake his entire plan on allowing himself to be captured or hoping that the hulk would get angry one also wonders exactly what iron man points out why would you anger numerous gods supersoldiers and mutated beasts who are your only adversaries right before launching an invasion divide and conquer makes sense only if your enemies are united the movie was confused between trying to having a villain break up a united group when they were never united and a divided group becoming united because they were being attacked whedon has done great work with an ensemble of interesting characters with his previous work on firefly it is unfortunate that despite many believing it to be the case whedon has not managed to pull off the same magic while firefly relied on character motivations to dictate their actions in a more or less simplistic and wandering plot line the relies on a contrived highstakes and stereotypical plot to dictate the actions of the characters while relying on previously earned knowledge of what made these characters tick rather than demonstrating their cares the arc of learning to work together only came about as a result of the villain taking a far too obsessive interest with angering his opponents instead of the characters looking within themselves for the strength to rise above their differences and work together our heroes are only united by action taken from without by others they are often seen squabbling over childish differences of personality rather than differences of opinions or conflicting motives instead of the uniting because of inner strength they unite due to the dubious actions of an unintelligent villain furthermore a lie from an otherwise useless samuel jackson only offers a weak emotional appeal from a character nobody seemed to like much in the first place it all detracted from the fulfillment when the finally decide to work together in the final act instead of excitement over each character finding their way through their own nuances and histories we feel excitement because the movie is finally going to have some fight scenes againthis is of course the real triumph of the the action the is certainly a triumph of spectacle it raises the bar as to what is possible with super hero movies however instead of raising that bar with themes in the way that nolans batman trilogy attempted or creating a rather human nonsuper hero in shyamalans unbreakable we are simply treated to betterexecuted and biggerbudgeted explosions also while the film may not have had the most introspective protagonists they had some entertaining tiffs robert downey jr elevates the other cast members fruitless attempts at comedic relief with comedic genius this only further solidifies him as the only actor in the bunch that doesnt need a good script to make anything sound awesomeultimately the intention and the effect is that the is nothing exceptional or timeless but certainly fun and excitingmy subjective breakdown of the movies major elements cinematography 910 editing 810 art direction 810 sound 1010 special effects 910 acting 610 pacing 510 characters 410 theme 410 music 610 overall 610,fantasy
the only fault that this movie has is that its not long enough the fights are great seamles panning through the war zone with ultra cool set pieces that are just used as fillers most movies would kill for some the little bits as the best thing in their whole film cap bouncing iron mans repulsors off his shield and taking out the enemies is just one example of this hulk steals the show probably because most people enjoyed the iron man and thor stand alone films more than the others and thus expect them to be the best charactersevery character has their time in the spot light and the only one that could have had a bit more action is samuel l jacksons nick furyeasily the best film of 2012 and for me the best film i have seen since the lord of the rings bring on 2 im sure it will destroy justice league at the box office,fantasy
it was inevitable that the would be made especially with the cinematic gold that was produced with the iron man franchise thor and captain america though the hulk films have struggled to find any kind of footing to speak of in this critics opinion the individual productions dedicated to the aforementioned superheroes ranged from spectacular to borderline dreadful i was especially disappointed in captain america to think that any one person could somehow blend all of these characters story lines into something coherentand as implausible as it seemed genuinely entertainedmade me more than skepticalbut as the saying goes never say never the is a spectacle to behold its thrilling funny and actually musters up quite a bit of unexpected character development how about thatwhat makes it so fantastic is the fact that nearly every major player is given equal screen time wisely whedon decided to paint these otherworldly heroes flesh tonethat is he makes them entirely human instead of being fodder for cgi carnage which paradoxically they are in a very good way we become invested in them as individuals they have their problems and never is this more relevant than when egos collide aboard a floating fortressa scene that almost sees the would be saviors of the world nearly tear themselves apart another wellplayed decision on the part of whedon was to play up the sociological angle of the mayhem taking place specifically the fact that the battle for humanity eventually moves to the streets of new york city evokes feelings directly reminiscent of the 911 attacks this strikes a particularly vulnerable chord in most of us even though its been 11 years since the horror of that september morning unfolded a general sense of unease still permeates our contemporary culture the fact that the draws such clear cut lines between good and evil makes it unexpectedly powerful and the musings by many of the characters that the world could do with a little old fashioned reverie is certainly a wellfounded oneactually i have only one gripe with the movie its probably too minor in many peoples eyes to warrant mentioning but in light of the myriad accomplishments that define the movie i simply cant ignore it specifically it has to do with the hulks sudden ability to control his rage in such a way as to be mindful of what he is and isnt smashing no explanation is given as to how hes able to do this in a hairpin moment of critical importance and its something that could have been easily resolved with a quick bit of dialogue or a thirty second scenefor everything that could have gone wrong with the its a miracle that its actually watchable actually its a wonderful piece of cinema not to mention one of the best action movies that ive ever seen if you havent checked this out be sure to do so before it leaves the big screen skipping it would be doing your inner kidheck your inner human a great disservice,fantasy
going into this movie i was afraid there would be no plot and mindless action and the characters wouldnt have enough screen time because there were too many surprise surprise the plot was pretty non existent but that didnt really stop this movie from being a lot of fun i give most of the credit to the actors if you care about the people you are watching you will automatically enjoy the movie more every single character in this movie is played to perfection by their actor or actress which makes you care about the characters which helps make up for the lack of plot because lets be honest the entire movie takes place on a flying aircraft carrier with the superheroes arguing with each other just waiting for the big finale in new york mark ruffalo finally makes the hulk likable and the cgi hulk was pretty bad ass tom hiddleston is an awesome loki hes not as good as he was in thor but im not sure that was even possible even supporting actors like clark gregg who plays colston plays his part perfect it could have been better its predictable and maybe the first hour is a little slow but its funny well acted and the action scenes are great so its worth a watch,fantasy
have you ever gone somewhere have no idea where you are at even going somewhere and having no idea what the purpose your there for is well the movie has all those mixed emotions and more if you have not watched the movie i suggest watch it before reading my reviewfirst i would like to add my opinion that this movie overall has many great qualities of an incredible film and some not so interesting parts to think of it not every movie is made to perfection and everyone could think different about anythingthe is an action type movie which lasts about two hours and twentythree minutes of excitement the film demonstrates these great super heros trying defeat the typical evil villains even though i am not interesting in action movies i enjoyed how it demonstrated all the team work and effort they combined to accomplish what they wanted and needed to defeat the villains in the beginning they start off the movie very vague and random there are characters i had no idea who they were apparently the movie combines these super heroes from several other movies if you have not watched the other movies you have no idea who these characters are after watching and having to do some research the characters come from the movies iron man incredible hulk iron man 2 and captain america obviously you would identify the big green character instantly in the video because everyone should know who he is but for the rest of the characters i think they should have acknowledged that everyone does not know them in the beginning it was very difficult to connect who all these people were because there were so many super heros and had no idea who they wereoverall this movie feels like a typical super hero action movie if i was not told that the characters came from other movies i would have never known and would have thought this movie was the best action movie ever created the title the fits perfectly with the combination of all of them it demonstrates the usual actions of the heros winning and the evil characters loosing as to the film itself and how it came out i would say this video has some great video effects we are now in 2012 and the effects of everything seems so real to an extent obviously we still are not able to fly but the fighting and weapons and everything seems realistic and makes it even a better action movie i dont want to ruin too much and add many details on the movie because i believe even though you have not watched the other movies the movie itself is a great film and should be witnessed spend those 143 minutes on a great movie and judge everything yourself you will not be displeased,fantasy
being the comic book junkie that i am and seeing numerous attempts at making decent super herovigilanti films most of which ending in disaster from the terrible fantastic four films to the ridiculously awful thor film there was no doubt in my mind that the film would lack any real substance but instead focus on immature repetitive one liners my only true incentive for paying to see this in theaters was joss whedon being the writer and director that being said i enjoyed the iron man captain america and hulk films as well my expectations were low for this ensemble super hero flick as i sat in the back row of the movie theater it was surprisingly very good it was well writtenfor the most part the acting was superb the plot was juicy and consistent the characters were believable and the cgi and other effects were great the film had many one liners but they were mature well thought out humorous and best of all the film didnt rely on them to make itself memorableaside from the over the top thor and loki characters and far too fast progressing beginning the film was excellent the film began very fast and then suddenly slowed down which was a slight bit annoying but with all things considered especially the other acting and special effects the film is a great film well worth viewing andor owning,fantasy
ironman captain america the hulk thor eagle eye and the black widow unite under the shield banner to face a colossal threat led by fallen god lokii come at this both late  the film is already one of the most financially successful films ever made as i write these lines  and relatively indifferent to the whole mythos i am also unfamiliar with said mythos superman and batman are well established in europe but many of marvels properties are much less so with that in mind the folks at marvel deserve an award for longterm strategic planningunder almost any shape an film would have made a deal of money so it is to the credit of the powers behind this behemoth that time was taken to establish each of the heroes individually before embarking on this group adventure the choice of iron man as a starting point particularly with the genius casting of robert downey junior proved especially savvy iron man has many similarities to batman but where the latter now the heart of a hugely successful rival film franchise is at heart quite dark and brooding iron man is inherently light hearted and fun something the first film outing captured brilliantlyassembling the was not always a smooth process the shield line felt a bit shoehorned into the hulks reboot derailed the plot or iron mans sequel and frustratingly cut short captain americas period solo potential and now that they were finally together supported by fresh film backstories of varying quality for the uninitiated youd think the studio would sit back and enjoy an easy successthankfully youd be wrongfrom the first few seconds up to the ending the film oozes with love for its characters giving most of them not only defining moments but also the fine small details that make you care downey junior could have easily walked away with the honors regardless of the overall films qualities that the filmmakers try their best to create a sense of balance shows both respect and confidence in their other characters and a strong determination to make this work as a team vehicle the often square captain america is thankfully done justice and after two different attempts the hulk is finally spot on mark ruffalo giving the film most of its heart and pathosuntil the the world was gearing up for the dark knights grand finale a trilogy that took a mildly ridiculous premise and turned it into a dark gritty and grand opera and for all their admirable qualities nolans masterpiece and its two companion pieces sometimes felt a tad grim the strikes a perfect balance between serious stakes and its inherent ridiculousness here joss whedon  of whom i was no fan coming into this  proves himself ideally suited to the task his trademark wit is perfectly attuned to the materialthe biggest summer blockbuster of 2012 is a finely crafted rousing adventure sparkled with humor and character a love of its protagonists and above all funthank you marvel and everyone involved for creating such high expectations and then exceeding them,fantasy
im not a big fan of the genre but i enjoyed this moviean action movie based on marvel comics that implies thrills and overthetopcgi this is a great movie if you are not looking for anything moreaction movies stand or fall by their foes in this case you are presented a great villainas for the heroes robert downey jr is at its best and samuel l jackson does his part they make the difference in my opinion possible spoiler alert i was a bit disappointed by the fact only one foe had to fight a squad of heroes but maybe im asking too much here as the script brought in some other elements to counter that,fantasy
i had my doubts and reservations about this movie i saw this last week and all have been squashed like a bug puny godfrom character depth to just the right amount of near nonstop action this movie delivers everything there is a very good reason why it is the highest grossing opening weekend movie in human history i thinkeverything that can be said about this movie is said in the countless other fantastic reviews made by people with a far more creative use of the english language than i could musterthe villain was the second best i have ever seen only to the joker by the late heath ledgeri am a simple guy so i will just end with thisgo watch the movie,fantasy
after watching this movie one thing which came in to your mind is wooow great job in fun and action and their combination is deadly i just watched is yesterday and i buy ticked for today too show is on i must say its a movie which you would like to see again and again and again effects are awesome and every super hero play its vital role my personal favorite iron man  was as usual wicked  action of hulk was breath taking this time loki was looking good in suit  over all concept was amazing which we have seen before many times gathering super heroes for a common cause but the way they did this time was simply the best ever,fantasy
im not what you would consider an authority on the but i did grow up reading all the marvel comics i could get my hands on i eagerly watched every movie tv show  cartoon starring super heroes i was a big fan of the old incredible hulk tv show starring bill bixby  lou ferrigno i read hulk thor iron man  comics as welli would suggest before seeing the seeing iron man iron man 2 the incredible hulk captain america  thor its not prerequisite but it would certainly enhance your enjoyment of the moviejoss whedon is one of my favorite directorswritersproducers buffy the vampire slayer angel firefly serenity dollhouse  cabin in the woods i love his sense of humorat first i was disappointed that edward norton didnt return for the role of bruce banner but mark ruffalo was incredible as the hulk samuel l jackson brings the bad ass to the role of col nick fury of shield robert downey jr brings his charisma to iron man again chris evans captain america chris hemsworth thor scarlett johansson black widow jeremy renner hawkeye and tom hiddleston loki all brought the magic in their rolesthe story and action were amazing just the right balance of eye candy character  comic relief i plan to see it again in the theater  buy it on bluray ive only seen a handful of movies in the theater more than once so that is high praise from me i eagerly await the next marvel movie,fantasy
 movie review oh my god i love this movie i went with a friend who prefers to be not named we both loved it it was incredible amazing and awesome movie this time i will say the plot first col nick fury brings together captain america iron man thor hulk black widow and hawkeye together to become the and fight loki and his army of chiturai robert downey jr is tony stark there is no one else that can play this role and if they get someone else he will pale in comparison chris evans is so awesome as captain america chris hemsworth really nails the role as thor if anyone is worried about mark ruffalo not doing a good job as banner i almost feel he was better than ed norton i like the norton as bruce too but ruffalo really feels like banner he is incredible as banner the hulk looks incredible he looks like mark ruffalo you feel it scarlett johansson does a great job as black widow there is a scene where she speaks in a foreign language she does such a good job she is not a perfect black widow but she does a good job of bringing her own take to the role jeremy renner is hawkeye he was my fan pick i feel like they listened to the fans when they casted him for the role tom hiddleston is so sinister as loki he was great in the thor movie but he is even better in this movie samuel l jackson really nails the role as nick fury he does such a commanding role he knows how to take charge clark greg as agent phil coulson does a great job too he knows how to take charge and he was such a fan boy around captain america cobie smulders as maria hill is so good she is a great shield agent the shield hellcarrier is like right out of the comic book wow the quinn jet is great too lokis army is so amazing looking then you have the levathion it is not fing fang foo the dragon from the iron man comics but it looks so incredible anyway they call the cosmic cube a tesseract if you dont know what that means basically it can open up wormholes the first time i heard that word is when i read the book wrinkle in time when i was a child so that is how i understand what it is everything you wanted is in this film and more when i saw the artist i thought no movie would beat it until now i feel this movie has smashed my scale i friend gave it 1110 and so am i so to quote spinal tap this dial goes to 11 for this movie it is 1110 it is that great this will be on blip tv and youtube soon big guy movie reviews,fantasy

saw it yesterday with my nephews and niece and enjoyed it more than any other marvel adaptation since spidermani cant think of any other recent film that could make this granitefaced 39 year old crack a grin at its moments of oldfashioned superheroic awesome such as when captain america intervenes at the last moment to save a brave civilian from being vapourised or simply watching a succession of childhood heroes duke it out with many a thoom and a wham yes this film taps into our need for larger than life heroes while at the same time making them likable by allowing us to laugh at them captain america is superstrong brave and handsome but probably wouldnt know how to use a computer mouse thor aka pointbreak wears his mothers drapes the hulk is a dangerously powerful toddler in torn shortsi even preferred tony stark in this one than his own films somehow his wisecracking arrogance is much more impressive when its at the expense of demigods and superhumans with the tactical prowess of captain a the director has managed to get each character to play an equal part in their own special way while providing a lot of fun and interest in the way they interact whether theyre cooperating or otherwisewhen a films heroes are near invincible it can be hard to induce a sense of jeopardy but this film succeeds in doing that by providing an unexpected event which also lends a strong emotional core we are also shown that our heroes can bleed in 2 effective moments i remember there is a pause we see that a hero is badly injured but he carries on without complaintsuch is the goodwill fostered by the film im prepared to skim over the negatives id have preferred the gathering of the team to be hastened on a bit and i think one stunt pulled by the black widow seemed more believably suited to a superpowered being which was unnecessary as her more down to earth abilities were already enough to prove that she was a valuable part of the teamafter we emerged from the cinema we were all still pretty stunned from the intensity of the action the verdict of my companions the film rendered the life of my 15 year old nephew complete his 11 year old brother thought it was ok and my 7 year old niece was inspired to switch her favourite character from thor to the hulk,fantasy
i went to the hall all smiling up and thrilled to watch after waiting a whole year and when i came outi was literally satisfied will grab your attention through all the time with its light humor and sexy fighting scenes plus you get to see cool gadgets and weaponsas expectedand the best part was that every superhero got their enough part and equal importance of which i was really worried and when they were together they really raised the bar of awesomeness also the nonsuperheroes were smoldering and of course skilled as hellso i think this movie shouldnt be missed at all but can be watched thrice,fantasy
at last the is released and does not disappoint it begins with a fast and mysterious with few characters which eventually merge to form the the movie has action scenes very well done and confrontations between the characters of epic size the film also features humor that feels good and it accounts for most of iron man one of the greatest strengths of the story is that all characters have their heroic piece in the movie and not entertain to lift just one another point is that loki despite the average character thor feels like a great villain for this group of heroes  as to 3d conversion is a medium are limited in some scenes just send things to people but the scenes of iron man in his suit look great it looks like these you into it at the end of the is an epic film which now brings together the best of the superhero movies which is fast and not disappoint the fans of the films of these characters,fantasy
my totally original suggestion is they do a dr strange movie why not get the rights to that while it might seem minor a bit of knowledge of dr strange helped give me a more solid picture of the marvel universe when the glistening cube was shown connecting different parts of the universe in this movie definitely going to see it a 2nd time tonight as soon as poss at least a 2nd time dr stranges weird dimensions being that other side of the universeespecially the early steve ditko version often with nick fury of shield as the other half of the comiccgi representations of steve ditkos surreal intertwinings of dimensions would be fantastic especially in 3dotherwise totally incredible film loved everythingcouldntt really fault it a hawkeye film would be cool by the crimson bands of cytorak that was a brilliant film joss wonder if keanu reeves would be a good suggestion for a dr strange,fantasy
bb  tdk not withstanding to me those 2 are dramaactionthrillers that happen to include a guy with a costumethe is the best super hero movie ever or in other words this is the best superhero movie ever and thats because it is the best superhero movie ever script9 dp9 sets9 directing10 acting8 editing10 fx10 score9 sound design8 fun1000 awesome awesome awesome there are so many levels of asskicking in this movie i cannot begin to describe them i think i barely blinked for the first act of the movie stopped breathing altogether during the second act only to have my eyeballs drop and my ears explode for the third act which made me go aaaawwww eeeehhh oohhhhh uuuuu and loads of ahahhaaahhhaa at one point i was actually using my tshirt to wipe teardrops off my face i was laughing so hard i actually cannot remember the last time i had so much fun at the movies if you are a comics  superhero or even just a general movie fan this one is a mustsee joss weadon just made himself the ubergod of geek olympus now somebody please give him a billion dollars and let him work his magic on the next 2 installments,fantasy
i didnt want anyone to spoil it for me so me n my buddy went for the first show on the first day not to mention it was a packed house in the multiplexthis movie kicks ass and there was not one moment when we felt bored all the superheroes entries were cheered by the crowd and it was iron man acc to me who stole the show it was a pleasant surprise in that it has as much humor as there was action by the way in reply to a previous review by leone dantonio reg bruce banner helping patients in calcutta in which world is india a third world country sir i hope you meant no offense but please watch the news we have sent a probe to the moon run a big chunk of the worlds information technology business have acquired companies like arcelor jaguarlandrover and have a missile with a range of 7000 km,fantasy
the is undoubtedly the best superhero movie ever made brilliant script great actors and awesome effects all actors have performed their role very well but what caught my eye are robert downey jr iron man and mark ruffalo hulk chris evans is good and scarlett johansson is looking pretty jeremy renner hawkeye and chris hemsworth thor are average the action scenes mixed with 3d effects take your breath away the movie is full of entertainment and some scenes will give you goosebumpsif you are a fan of superhero movies then you must watch the this movie worth every penny highly recommended,fantasy
pros i too was piqued by the anticipated teamup between batguy scatguy iron dude deepdriller worktheshaft man mushroom maven and other characters and properties that were interesting until i realized that i had responsibilities the best part of the movie was when batguy or one of those other interchangeable starryeyed dolts turned on his magical jetskis thereby exciting all of the overgrown basementdwelling bedwetting imbeciles who still subsist entirely on allowance money oh man you should have seen them you could smell the doritos and undigested quesadillas from a mile awayoh and can we have more of acdcs back in black during the teasers for each superheros own movie it is clear we cannot get enough the music underscores the badassery of each character even though we know that neither of the actors nor actresses can throw a decent punch to save their livescons it could have used a story,fantasy
anyone that has seen my activity on the boards know my opinions of the film arent all that high to fully explain how disappointed i was i have written up 4 reviews on imdb and yet none of them i feel have fully captivated what i felt among leaving the theater i saw imdb reviews i saw the ticket line that went out the cinema through the food court and out the door i saw the name of a man i idolized creatively tied onto this joss whedon and i saw that this would be what my childhood went into because believe it or not marvel in part was my childhood to say i came out disappointed is like saying people got hurt at hiroshima understatement of the millenniumbefore i start i will name some good things about the film the cinematography did get the lighting and framing right that looks like an actual comic book come to life the acting for what theyre given is okay and for the most part the cgi is actually pretty well done in terms of making things like the helicarrier the alien army and the hulk come to lifeso with that in mind what would be my complaints okay have you ever seen a joss whedon tv show then youll know the formula of they argue and a tragedy strikes to make them band together have you seen an alien invasion film then youll know the routine of the world is in danger we need the best we can get have you ever seen a comic book film then youll know the routine of the heroes face a threat they stop it and yet come out victorious i dont know i was expecting more from this film especially considering at the time i saw it it had the imdb rating of 9110when it comes to a fun film of course you dont need to make it dark serious and as depressing as all hell but when it comes to the greats indiana jones star wars die hard batman 1989 superman 1 and 2 you get the idea they all had elements that did make people say something is at stake in superman 2 we had this all mighty and strong hero reduce himself to a weakling while others who are like him take over the world in star wars empire and return that film tested the hero morally in the sense that he couldnt kill his own father for obvious reasons but it was brought back with the humor which unlike this film didnt go too overboard in this film the only one that dies is someone who is brought back to life later so not only did that rule out the thought of theres something at stake but it made the motivation for the team to band together eventually entirely pointlesshowever i need to address something else the humor oh god the humor now im not against humor in films but this film threw every joke it could in the way of the audience to get any giggle it could but keep in mind the best joke is i am a god you dull creature i will not be bullied by beats the crap out of him that joke got an applause in the theater i was in that gives you an idea of what the humor of this film is likeanother problem is that loki is too weak to be matched with the sure he has his army but before they invaded he was beaten in combat 3 times once in an earlier film not exactly feeling the weight of him as a villain if the heroes have demonstrated that they can defeat him at every turn theyve encountered him oh and thor is in this film if you remember the first film youll see that the only means of teleportation between worlds was destroyed they made a sequel to thor and do they explain in the sequel or this film how he managed to get back to earth for the events in the establishment whats thatessentially the major problem with this film is that it plays way too safely and its predictable nothing happens in this film that makes you feel like i care for these characters i want them to make it out okay nor this villain is way too powerful for any of them to take on alone i hope they make it out okay if you want your audience member to be invested you need these things to be going through the mind of the viewer this is not on the basis of a werner herzog wim wenders or stanley kubrick film this is on the basis of star wars superman 1 and 2 die hard etc basic films that had these elements in them that made them classicsoverall i have bitched and moaned about this film for ages but nothing can really capture how disappointed i was with this film it basically turned me into a cynical bastard that was aware of all the tricks and manipulative tools used to make this film have so much hype to be fair it could be okay for any die hard comic book fan but for those that expect this to be anything more than another comic book film or another joss whedon film or another blockbusteryoure better off not seeing this,fantasy
earths mightiest heroes gather together to fight loki and an invading alien horde in the payoff to one of the most ambitious cinematic concepts ever that of a shared universe between multiple films with different characters and stories my initial reaction when i first saw three years ago was that i liked it a lot but thought it didnt quite live up to the hype i saw it again a month later and had an even less favorable opinion focusing more on the flaws that time around and strictly comparing it to what i considered the truly classic comic book movies now that ive seen it with fresh eyes after a few years and several more marvel films including the sequel to this one i can say that all of the hype did influence my first opinion of it its hard to dispute now that it is a terrific movie that was probably the best marvel had put out at that pointjoss whedon does a fantastic job directing and handling the grand scope of it all his script is smart funny and impressively services all the different characters well he even improves upon some of them from their previous characterizations particularly black widow here we get a vast improvement over her depiction in iron man 2 whedon really gives scarlett johansson a chance to shine and prove her character deserves to stand alongside the big leaguers in the group mark ruffalo replaces ed norton as bruce banner and at the time i wasnt crazy about this i liked norton in his hulk movie but i think it turned out to be a good change ruffalo brings something different to the role im not sure how norton could have fit in with this cast or especially how his interactions with johansson would have been different samuel l jackson chris evans chris hemsworth tom hiddleston and robert downey jr are all perfect jeremy renner is arguably the weakest link in the cast but thats largely because he isnt given as much to work with as the others the special effects are great except for a couple of iffy spots in the climactic battle against the chitauri also captain americas costume was clearly still a work in progress the blank back where a star should be just makes it seem like incomplete thats a minor quibble thoughits not flawless but its damned entertaining the action scenes particularly the fights are exciting and spectacular i cant imagine any fan of the comics or the movies being disappointed by them theres something electric about seeing the characters from the prior movies come together and interact the little kid in me who was once satisfied to see a shoddy version of thor appear on tv with lou ferrignos hulk would never have thought hed see something like this on the big screen in his lifetime seeing these characters hanging out and fighting with and alongside each other is a dream come true for any longtime marvel fan whatever else happens with this shared universe whether marvel ever tops this film or not ill always cherish the movie just for that,fantasy
when this movie was first about to hit theatres i won tickets to go to see the advance preview unfortunatelyfortunately i choose the latter i was not able to attend as i wasnt in the region of the preview at the timethank god because if i had had a whole days sleep woke up and attended this movie i still would have fallen asleep watching this drivel i have attempted and i emphasis the word attempted to watch this movie three times before i was able to watch it in full finally after a fourth attempt i fail to see how this movie scored so damn highi could literally put a bunch of chimps into a room and they could write a script at the absolute least two times better than this movie i could also think of more fun activities to do instead of watching this for example stabbing two pencils into my eyes and moving them around for the duration of this filmexaggeratedyeah well so is this film and the hype that surrounds it dont get me wrong i can appreciate joss whedon and his works eg buffy brilliant and dollhouse inspired but this movie was an absolute miss why people rave and rate this movie good baffles me i had to say this again because i just cant work it out no character development and yes i get that you dont really need that as they all have their own individual movies so i recommend just watching them and why put the black widow in here did she even use powers all i saw was her using pistols was she supposed to appeal and be empowering to the female audience cause if so i missed that memo and the fact that there was so much cgi use they dont need that they are superheroes for petes sake superheroes and dont even get me started on the amount of fighting yay fun its an action but some was just pointless where on earth do i even need to put any thought into this movie let alone see what the heck is going on cause the explosions and gunshots are so distracting i think i have literally put more thought into writing this review than the amount of thought running through my mind whilst watching this movie pretty sure my iq dropped even knowing about let alone attempting to watch it this many times what can i say im a trier im giving this movie a 110 i would give it a zero but i felt the scene at the very end of the credits when all the heroes are sitting in the diner with the bored tired looks on their faces depicted exactly how i felt after watching this movie plus i cant rate it zero dont watch it and if you do dont say i didnt try save you 2 hours and 23 minutes of your life,fantasy
as far as me liking superhero movies its either spiderman or batman why because everything else usually sucks this film is no exception i would like to know why they would bring back loki as the main villain he is boring he aint menacing and overall doesnt offer any thing intriguing well lets think what kind of army loki will lead i got it generic alien invasion where will it take place why new york of course oh my not to mention the aliens were weak and never possed any threat besides they are all coming out of a hole in the sky very easy to concentrate fire for the military but instead they send four super heroes and the fact that the government was willing to destroy new york with a tactical nuke within 30 minutes of the invasion and killing millions of people is absolutely ridiculous but of course ironman has got to save the day you would think all of these superheroes together would be entertaining and for the most part they are if you are looking for something refreshing or even remotely smart you will have to go somewhere elsethe film is genius in the sense of bringing all these heroes together the more times i watch it the more i like it i do have some gripes with it but overall i hate to admit it has less faults then the dark knight rises and is better then it to a certain extent really i just like it for tony stark the rest is alright,fantasy
i honestly dont understand why such an endless parade of cinematographic clichs is being hailed as one of the best movies of all time evil villain trying to conquer the planet check hot clever chick in tight clothes check battle in manhattan check and i can go on from dialogue to set dressing alien design blockbuster action clichs nothing in this movie triggered me whatsoever except maybe robert downey jrs performancenice bubblegumpopcorn action flick for a rainy sunday and maybe something for comic book fans for all other occasions yawn,fantasy
the first time i saw this movie i thought it was a well crafted superhero movie but when seeing it the second time you start to pick up on somethings and it just isnt that good now i am not downing this movie since its not as entertaining as the first time seeing it but you just notice some weaknesses now when it comes to the plot there really isnt anything all that original a certain team needs to get their act together and not quarrel bicker and fight amongst each other in order to fight and win against a battle or a game when the odds are against them seem familiar because it has been done countless times but the execution is the most important thing and the execution for the movie is well done and entertaining most of the way through the final fight at the end is worth the price of admission however when it comes to the plot there really isnt anything special that makes it stand out the plot and editing in john carter in my opinion is more well done than this in my opinion but unfortunately john carter didnt do so well at all when compared to this movie now josh whedon did a pretty good job when it comes to the marvel characters portrayed in this movie and stuck pretty close to the comic book materials but in the comics although the characters are arrogant there are other elements that turns it away from it being the main focus for this movie arrogance is the main part of what the characters face and is one of the biggest obstacle in their path what the do is constantly have a penis measuring competition with each other when the world is at stake anyways the fighting and action sequences are really entertaining and cool to watch some scenes are like superhero smackdown battles so those scenes were entertaining as well despite it all happening over arrogance and pride so that is why i give this movie a 78107810,fantasy
if you havent seen the yet you must be completely immune to hype give yourself a pat on the shoulderbut to be fair it is entertaining and worth the watch especially if youre interested in witnessing a curious film trend ive been noticing lately thats pretty much formula for the the trend is this the beginning is smart suspenseful and witty with a somewhat interesting story for the end you can just turn your brain right off and people love itwe start out with characters who have interesting back stories to divulge some weighty threats and the hilarious jokes you knew would be there the second you found out this would be directed and written by joss whedon tony stark robert downy jr absolutely rapidfires the hilarity as expected and pepper potts gwyneth paltrow is a comedic accomplice who quickly vanishes from the story the black widow scarlett johansson hints at some dark secrets and its not clear whether bruce banner mark ruffalo is a help or a big looming threat of letting loose and tearing everyone to pieces actually if youve ever seen a movie before it is pretty clear captain america chris evans had some potential because hes from wwii era but was used mostly for jokes at the expense of his anachronisms he was frozen for half of the past century so he doesnt really get modern cultural references technology etc i cant stand thor and i cannot believe what a joke his solo film looked like from the trailer nor that natalie portman would get herself mixed up in that mess but maybe thats just me but the other are interesting and well written for the first half of the moviewhat bothered many critics wasnt even a concern to me in a search for something to be nitpicky about lots of critics have complained that there was too much infighting between the heroes who were clearly being manipulated to turn against one another by evilmastermind loki however this didnt take up much screentime and was done in a wellwritten and believable way i thought what they were bickering about was kind of reasonable i would be a little upset too if my boss lied to me about developing nuclear weapons of mass destructioni was led to believe that half of the movie would be the fighting each other and when you say fighting with relation to super heroes you think actual physical fighting nope it was just one scene of some very reasonable banterokay there is one fight scene between thor and iron man that went on a little while and i personally cant even keep my eyes open during action scenes with no dialogue but i felt like it was justified and when you think about it people want to see thor go up against iron man again not incredibly problematicthey were right about the enemy not having a very good strong reasonable or deep motivation for taking over earth this is another reason why i think we were given leave to turn our brains off after half of the movie at the beginning it looks like loki might be a worthy and complex opponent he has some qualms with the american belief in freedom kinda seemed like he was going somewhere with that but he didnt which makes it seem like a gimmicky attempt to make this bad guy stand out from sauron or darth vader which while onedimensional were good villains because they stood for something metaphorical ie the dark side of humanity or the germans in wwii lokis just evil for the sake of being evil but youve already heard thatthe real problem in this movie is that after all that time spent writing up interesting characters and weighty plot points that delve into issues like a possible limitless energy source and the dangers of nuclear war actually managing to cover new territory on that front and making a formidable enemy that should require something brilliantly clever to defeat we get a really long extended fight scene fixes that arent believable and border on plot holes a complete undermining of the big bad guys abilities not to mention some predictability oh boy where do i startthe screenplay must have ended after the got to manhattan im gonna guess 23 into the screen time from there on out its mostly oneliners yawn i liked the flying things that made me cringe when they flew into the beautiful new york architecture that is now in that fictional world gone forever i didnt like the allbrawn and no brains approach,fantasy
these charactersheroes iron man hulk thor captain america etc allow the audience to pick and choose their favorite characters as well as identify with certain heroesvillains what joss whedon does a phenomenal job of is the portrayal of most of the heroes humanity the constant reminder that theyre just like us people really enjoy that in a super hero movie though many hollywood movies rely on special effects and cgi their marketing tactics are certainly well grounded people want to sit down with their friendsfamilyetc watch a movie and walk out feeling energized after a stressful day at work or school not that thoughtprovoking movies are too much for audiences but sometimes reality isnt what people want to pay to see on a more personal note i really enjoyed robert downey jrs witty remarks and character in general or maybe i am a bit biased since we train under the same master eric oram,fantasy
to start off i didnt hate the movie nor did i love it it was just alright for me going in to the movie i was already skeptical of the movie due to the fact of all the superheros in one movie i knew that one of the superheros would overshadow the rest and in my opinion it happened although robert downing jr was the biggest name on the cast the writers and directors just limited him on his character as iron man i think the hulk was that superhero that overshadowed the rest and its not the directors fault that it happened its what you get when you have all of those superheros in one film one will get over looked while the other rises to the top i just hope that this movie dont spark an idea to make justice league into a movie cause that would be to much for one movie i think but other than that i like the movie but captain america could have jumped in the river cause his character is pointless,fantasy
i like comic books but as much as anyone and i am sure it is entertaining but it also seem animated like a live action cartoon  which is cool i guess for men who have never grown up and wished that they had super powers parading in their out there costumes rescuing the world from super villains so they could be declared a hero  that is the mentality that makes movieslike this so popular in a nut shell because it has elements that peeks their interest special effects action babes in cat suits and the battle between super villains and super heroes to sum it up the ultimate dude flick the only plus side for us women  was robet downey jr reprising his alter ego iron man and chris hemsworth reprising his role as the thunder god thor,fantasy
special effects action scenes sound humor acting all is great as expected from such blockbusters however dare not expect much in the realm of coherence one can argue that surrealism and fantasy is at the core of the marvel comics experience however some people expect a degree of reality to mix with the fiction which is where magic happens and classics are made the enemies that the heroes must face look a lot like video game characters mindlessly going about their doharm business for no other reason other than that they are bad the tactics employed by the enemies are laughable and their strategy non existent one would expect more of these enemies especially considering that they are supposed to be so technologically advanced so in my opinion it deserves a very high 7 because of the way this is presented and because it can really entertain for one evening just dont expect have much to think or talk about afterwards,fantasy
its not really clear to me why this film is so highly rated here there are only two things to recommend it spectacular special effects and the acting of robert downey jr and most of the rest of the ensemble who make the absolute maximum out of the material all kudos to them for their fine performancesthe main problem for me is with the story which is absolute dross what the hell is going on with the flying aircraft carrier for example yeah it looks great on screen but in terms of logic there is none why are the giant bugs so intent on destroying or dominating earth why are there these scandinavian demigods running about when everybody knows these belong only to norse mythology and not to the real world i could go on but i wont bore all of you who are no doubt going to retort with lengthy explanations of all the ins and outs of the history of the fantasy universe this all arises from however viewing this as a standalone film without knowing the extended comicbook background the events in the film however exciting dont make much senseim sorry im not a superhero buff i admit it i hate superhero comic books but seriously none of this guff makes any sense im sure robert downey jr would agree if he wasnt cleverly making a fortune out of the iron man franchise give me intelligent sf any day,fantasy
any comic book movie  worth its salt far as budgets go  can give us terrific action with mindblowing cgi and special effects marvels the the culmination of the work of five movies one of them a sequel to the first iron man is stuffed with a good load of action and mayhem and a climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes captain america incredible hulk thor and tony stark plus relative newcomers black widow and hawkeye with nick fury and agent colson in the wings and if you want to get your money shots joss whedon doesnt skimp out but the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasnt just for name cachet though it probably helpedwhat whedons done over much of his career in tv and other films and webseries buffy firefly dr horrible angel etc was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical supernatural otherworldlyalien forces but making it always about stakes humor horror drama and solid conflicts villains dont just act nasty they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do and if theyre not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters full of the stuff that makes them great to watch especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone ie the mayor on buffy for those that recallso here we get loki previously a villain in thor and later sort of brought back for thor 2 and is by far the highlight of the film as tom hiddleston chews up scenery but does it in a kind of elegant theatrical relishing way by the time he spews out muelling quim youre on the edge of your seat his performance what he does with every moment of screen time is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky and yet his ego and pettymindedness does him in and whedon has a lot of fun writing this character making him a threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstancesthis is one of the best of the marvel films just by the way that whedon goes about the sort of ghostbustersninja turtles formula  the four main players each distinct playing off one another but things could turn on a dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that along with hiddleston downey once again makes tony stark a helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters and johansson actually has a few really great scenes  whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other complex male characters to shame  and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on she stands out especially widows scene with loki ruffalo too does a lot with a little until he gets to the other guyi dont know if is great art but it does what i want to see when i go to big giant behemothlike spectacles provide me a host of characters who have to work together and gives them interesting entertaining and believable things to say at 142 minutes it goes by at a great pace as well  not too fast not too slow nothing drags here and that counts as well along with the first iron man and the recent marvel netflix show daredevil this is the mcu at the top of their game,fantasy
one of the most anticipated movies is here and the name isthe movie was good overall with good caste and excellent vfxthe usp of the film was that the effects are really good and humor is excellentwatching the super heroes battle it out with each other and the evil is even better a lot of humor and mix of action ideally makes this movie a summer blockbuster for surethe editing is excellent and the character building is fantastic the director has tried to give each superhero its due except the thor which seems to have a sort of subdued entry in the movie anywaysit is fun surely the 3d is better than most of the crap which comes out calling it 3dso do watch it 3dnow why the hell did i give it 7 and not 1010 the reason is that was slow in the first halfyea they wanted to build the story alright but it was kinda slow for mei was expecting a lot more action in the first half which was absent apart from 2 fights which i wont spoil it for you guyssecond half was much better but i felt the action was limitedthe superhero fights were mishmashedthey were certainly not enoughi wanted more superhero fightsmore dramamore actionit just didnt happenthe ending was not very great eitherwe have seen these sorta endings many timeswe want something newspecially beingcommon guysso for me is above average moviegood movie but certainly not the best710,fantasy
all of these marvel movies are overrated and overhyped probably because people cant bare their reality or watching realitybased movies that fantasy is driving their lives it took me 3 sittings to finish this movie,fantasy
sometimes i think that the mcu is the worst thing to happen to comic book films thats not to say that a majority of their films are bad but the mcu as a franchise has turned comic book movies into something more corporate as a whole something more cynical and bland thats not to say that the dceu is any better though they arguably were up until justice league ruined everything but the mcu as a whole has grown to represent the reinvention of superhero films as a product joss whedons the is perhaps one of its more hollow examplesperhaps im missing the point maybe joss whedons as a concept is more about the novelty the extravaganza and the size of the event than it is about the filmmaking many defenders of the film will assert this and they arent necessarily wrong there is an undeniable appeal to watching such a massive scale crossover event between our favorite marvel superheroes after years of solo outings the first shot of the back to back as a chiutari invasion closes in on them is quite a memorable one and touched me in all the right fanboy spots that being said with the being such a hyped up and ambitious film i had my expectations set rather high i wanted this film to be great more than anything but in the end it just let me feeling empty and unsatisfiedthe musical score is certainly a major highlight alan silvestris score is one of the most rousing uplifting and exciting in hollywood blockbuster history and if anything comes close to delivering the epic feel that this movie is so obviously going for its his music its catchy its triumphant and it stands head and shoulders above more than half of the forgettable orchestral scores used in these kinds of filmsthe performances are fine there isnt a single miscast here as these actors have more than proven in their solo outings the problem is that the film gives them absolutely nothing memorable to do there are no small acting choices that really stuck with me no moments that really challenge their skills as performersthere are quotable lines sure most of which extend to trailer talk but very few genuine character moments apart from some new quips some characters get far more focus than others thor and captain america have no purpose here and the only one who gets anything in the way of any real character development is iron man nobody else goes through any kind of genuine arc in this film at all nobody has grown or changed throughout the course of the film outside of stark who grows to become more of a team player everyone else on the team merely comes together out of necessity to save the worldthis brings me to another massive problem with the film specifically the chemistry between the teams heroes there is none the spend over 2 thirds of the entire movie arguing amongst themselves like children over the most childish reasons imaginable of course because thats what ive waited 4 years and 5 movies to see the worlds greatest superheroes engaged in a perpetual pissing contest because they dont like each others attitudes god forbid we actually try and develop any kind of bond of chemistry between the team members many may point to coulsons death as a justifiable rallying cry to bring the team together but coulsons relationship with the heroes isnt nearly as strong or developed enough to make me invested in their change of heart so most of the film is just the worlds mightiest heroes fighting like 12 year olds how epicloki is a joke in this film while there have definitely been worse villains in the mcu loki is still a nonsensical inconsistent and poorly written character we follow him after the events of thor where hes trying to take over the earth as fascist dictator with the help of a chiutari army granted to him by thanos his motivations had nothing to do with fascism or personal ambition in thor but apparently touching on his personal need for validation and unconditional love that was established in that film was too difficult a task for whedon to deliver on instead hes a generic one dimensional bad guy who says nasty sexist things to cheaply make the audience hate him easier do i really need to mention the cringeworthy and emotionally manipulative scene in germany where a nazi regime survivor stands up to loki in order to make a hamfisted and boneheaded allegory to hitler if youre going to reference that dark horrifying period in world history you need to earn that moment tonally narratively and emotionally the doesnt even attempt to earn such a scene and lokis similarities to hitler pretty much start and stop at hes a dictator who thinks others are lesser than himim really not trying to rain on anyones parade most of my friends love this film and i can definitely see why the ambition of the concept and grandness of the production definitely lend itself to some praise for me however as someone who was deeply excited for this film it really falls short furthermore i think that its had a very negative affect on the more streamlined style of hollywood blockbusters today nearly every insufferable and boring cliche ive found in them can be traced back to this one the film went for a circus show when it should have gone for an epic and that really saddens me,fantasy
having watched this at least a dozen times now i can honestly say its one of my alltime favourites its a perfect example of recent marvel films corny as ever full of great oneliners and epic fight scenes mark ruffalo is handsdown my favorite bruce banner its a tough lineup to pick from but hes also my favorite actor in also my only disappointment about this hulk is that each hit he takes doesnt cause him to grow even bigger  stronger it was one of the best parts about eric banas hulk that left you wondering if there was any limit to the hulks power and abilities on the other hand the animation is absolutely flawless there are a number of truly surreal moments because of this most notably the freeroaming camera shot that follows the final battle throughout the city moving from one fight to the next each time heroes cross paths this is set to be a blockbuster classic for years to come,fantasy
it promises to be a liveaction comic book and it delivers in spades the production values and special effects are out of this world like a comic book though it has a simple plot line and produces essentially zero emotional involvement thor is annoying and scarlett johansson is as flat as everbeing eye candy pays her bills also even granting the comic book nature of this film samuel jackson was clearly just picking up a paycheck since ive never seem him so lifeless and unconvincingthis movie is pure sugar with no redeeming nutritional value but as a guilty pleasure it succeeds well although too much of this stuff would personally make me nauseous,fantasy
this is decent entertainment but it is in the end just an action packed movie  i think it is a good collaboration movie between the different super heroes but some steal the show more then others you almost think that this is the third installment of a rich super hero movie franchise but that came a year laterthis is action and effects for every buck there is a story but the plot can be hard to follow and you tend to concentrate on all the eyecandy most of the time it has a rather dark finish to it maybe it is the new thing after the dark knight that it has to have a bit of a gloomy and dark feel i am not especially fond of it for this film since they are all dressed in bright colored costumes and are a more fun loving crowd then the big black batthis is definitely entertaining and delivers a solid action packed adventure with plenty of effects smart replies blasting sound and great characters,fantasy
i was in 5th grade when i first saw the trailer of the i got shocked i mean iron man thor captain america and the other heroes were in one movie heck it was like a dream come true for me i saw the movie it was so cool the story wasnt much but it was still awesome the characters were great and so was its finale when the nuclear missile went into space with iron man in it then the chitauri mothership exploded but something happenednow that i got matured it got different the way i see this movie before i like it very much now im like now that ive seen this movie so many times im over with it i dont really know why but im sure its just that i had a feeling that i should see something new thats right the way to cure it is to watch its sequel age of ultron maybe ill see it on the big screen i just hope it happensin conclusion the was a good movie its great when you see it the first time,fantasy
where do i start ok superheroes saving the earth from aliens a recurrent and also favorite theme for the hollywood to score big at box officethis film is watchable due to cgi effects why this film is such a box office hit well may be because of underlying desire of every human being to be a hero in one way or the othereccentric super heroes and silly story dominates the film the story is for kids not for me as i couldnt connect with it in conclusion go and enjoy this film for its cgi effects and physics defying stunts,fantasy
this movie could have been anything and it would have made this much moneythey could have written almost any plot and the charismatic collection on screen would have made it goodit is almost an accomplishment that joss whedon and co produced this insteadthe general reaction to this spectacle almost made me wonder if i had watched a different movie most of my friends seemed to like and the critical reviews were positive enough critics and audiences alike seemed to think it had delivered on its promisesmy biggest impression walking away was did half that movie take place on an aircraft carrier that can fly ill save you the trouble precisely 70 minutes of this 140 minute film takes place on a flying aircraft carrier it is so precisely half the movie that i am certain it was done on purpose this was an appalling waste of potential in every sense,fantasy
i was so happy when this movie was announced as i noted in my review of captain america the first avenger cap is my all time favorite comic book super hero which of course makes me a de facto fan i was so happy to see this film come to life and for marvel to be able to pull off something as grandiose as this movie and then when the movie came out it was awesome amazing over the topone of the best action movies ever madeand i still feel that way the rocks it really is a superb film the action was great the characters were great the story was great everything was greatbut now fast forward three years and ive watched all the marvel movies numerous times and there are other mcu movies that have been made since then too and so i sat down to watch the again the other nightandwelli guess familiarity breeds contemptthe movie is still great but i suppose that after several viewings it gets sort of repetitious and you see the imperfections a bit more hemsworth is not up to the standard he set for himself in thor for example or the contrived notion of coulsons death pulling the team together the latter is probably the worst facet of the filmstill the is great one of the best comic book movies ever made for sure but whereas i once gave it a 1010 ive now bumped that down to a 910 obviously still a great great movie but one that just doesnt have the staying power for me that i imagined it might,fantasy
and so here we are with the back in the 1990s marvel was filing for bankruptcy leading stan the man lee to sell the film rights to many of their characters the only rights they have left is the and explains why theyve had to dig into their more obscure past to turn other franchises into movie productions namely 2014s fantastic guardians of the galaxy still i love the approach they took towards building their big team movie by establishing this ensemble cast in their own features starting with iron man 2008 the following five years lead to a bunch of movies that have many highs and lows leading us all to this point the results are a success but also far from flawlessnick fury samuel l jackson director of the peacekeeping organisation shield recruits iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarlet johansson the hulk mark ruffalo and thor chris hemsworth to form a team that must stop thors brother loki tom hiddleston from subjugating earth and a much larger looming threatknowing that joss whedon was going to be writing and directing this i could already see what directions this movie was going in whedon has a rare quirk in his writing that really allows characters to bounce off each other effortlessly but the directing in some areas always feels stiff to me i look back to his previous outings as a director and could easily say that the have the exact same chemistry as the characters of whedons firefly still it feels like he has mastered the way he likes to approach his material and theres enough to carry its lengthy 2 hour 20 minute running timeevery actor does solid work and the culmination of these characters from their respected features feels effortless i want to give mark ruffalo and the fx crew particular praise for finally bringing out the hulks familiar traits that have felt absent for so long but i also wish that the character had felt more uncontrollable like in its comic book counterpart where they trick him into fighting specific people i also find myself very underwhelmed when using loki as a villain tom hiddleston is a fine performer and the role has garnered him hundreds of many fans but by the third act hes rarely a threat anymore and even then the payoff feels like i said underwhelming saying that many villains appear throughout the movie that are sure to please the diehard fans and promise that the situations will escalate in the inevitable future sequelsfinal verdict when all is said and done the dialogue and chemistry works the scenarios range from great to average and enough substance is here to promise more to come from marvels phase 2 of movies and the upcoming sequel age of ultron its a hollywood blockbuster for all ages and a damn fine one at that 7510,fantasy

69 all that build up from all those already very big movies was about worth it as this is quite an accomplishment to not only bring together all those superheroes but also to give them each an pretty equal share of screen time and importance the script works well despite the plot being very big budget hollywood and it has some nice funny touches here and there the final battle in new york where was spiderman when all this was going on is very well developed that sticks to the equal share of each character very well and gives a good portion of what the audience want to see action mayhem this is without doubt one of the better superhero movies ever and one of the best marvel movies to date roll on the next mammoth,fantasy
superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldnt be totally enamoured with itas seen in a lot of the negative comments a lot of them being condescending though enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already and some not even worthy of being called reviews assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right true the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting in fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didnt quite work personally and that was jeremy renner who was rather on the dull side as hawkeye whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten that hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly however the rest of the performances were great a big shout out going to tom hiddleston who is serpentine personified as loki though robert downey jnrs charismatic iron man samuel l jacksons nononsense nick fury mark ruffalos very confident hulkhe doesnt make you miss eric bana or ed norton chris hemsworths dynamic and not wimpy thorif he was i put it down to his hidden demons character development and chris evans modest heartfelt captain america were equally great scarlett johansson convinces mostly too black widows back story is intriguing and johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for black widow for a film with as many characters as seen here assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interestingonly hawkeye really disappointed in character and not onesided and all of them have their turn to shine it didnt feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it the film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stuntwork alan silvestris score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting the story may be formulaic and standard goodandevil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour pathos and action with not one component overshadowing the others what was really enjoyable especially was the toetotoe with thor and iron man and hulk what was really remarkable was the script filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to the while also with joss whedons own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work overall assemble may not be 100 perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it 910 bethany cox,fantasy
the a movie based on very popular superhero comic book characters the key word being comic bookthis movie hits the nail perfectly for every comic book fan  superhero fan in existence i mean you have hulk iron man captain america  thor all brought to the life in vivid explicit detail personally im a comic book reader an avid reader actually  i never in my wildest dreams thought something like this would be made a lot of comic book adaptations kinda miss their mark completely they end up being totally revamped or matured i hope you understand what i mean by this sometimes it works like in the dark knight but thank goodness this movie is straight up for the fans what more could you ask fori tell you seeing the hulk actually being the hulk  watching a comic book movie actually delivering the action just like a comic  even better is truly a rare thing indeed especially for these type of comic booksone other important thing  if you dont know who bruce banner is or the name tony stark  perhaps have never heard of marvel please dont even bother this movie will just be another popcorn flick for you or worse the stuff happening in this movie will just fly straight over your head  you wont even begin to understand whats going on,fantasy
there have been many superhero movies that i have massively enjoyed like spiderman and the much praised xmen 2 while i do get that some people consider xmen 2 or even spiderman 2 as the best examples of a superhero movie done right one cannot ignore the sheer magnitude of the project with the setup beginning in 2008 with iron man and ending with captain america the first avenger 2011 fans had been waiting anxiously for the result and i for one loved it the plot revolves around the threat that loki poses as he hopes to conquer earth with a feared army of advanced alien beings that will be transported to our planet through the energy source known as the tesseract in this dire situation nick fury will look to assemble a group of remarkable people that will be known as thethe pacing of the film is wonderfully done as it takes about 30 minutes to introduce the characters in the movie from then on the perils outside but also within the groups personality will create the conflict the film needs the choice of going with joss whedon as the director and cowriter was definitely a wise one as he supplies us with his sharp vision of the story and characters but also his dynamic and funny dialog everyone of the performances were great with everyone having their time in the spotlight at least in my view the effects are of course very well put within the film and only add to its spectacleas far as im concerned it may take a long time for me to get sick of this movie and even then thats a remote possibility with its spot safely secured within my top 20 its unlikely ill ever watch a film like the i just hope the sequel can deliver as much as this and perhaps something even more unexpectedrating 9510,fantasy
but then again anything with robert downey jr in it is simply awesome i am also now interested in thor my title pretty much sums up what i think of this movie i will gladly watch another one if i can find out if another one is being made or notim going to watch it again on netflix i would like to know if this is the only one out there the and if there is going to be another the as well i will watch that one too normally my genre of movies is paranormal syfy or stephen king related but this works for me as well i will now look into action films as being my second favourite genre of movies and television,fantasy
joss whedons the is truly one of the best action moves along with a perfect cast for an action picture of which that includes robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo jeremy renner samuel l jackson tom hiddleston and scarlet johannson with great action sequences costumes and special effects this movie was one of the most groundbreaking visual achievements of 2012 the movie also goes on a par with great marvel films such as the iron man trilogy spider mans 1  2 xmen the incredible hulk ghost rider captain americas 1  2 and more not only this was a great movie it was also one of the best movies of 2012 because of how well this movie was done,fantasy
marvels the is a fantastic movie director josh wheldon did a fantastic job creating this movie i highly recommend it to watch but beware to those with young childrenthis movie should hold true to the pg13 rating it was given there is some language and intense battle scenes but the overall message is great you have to come together to conquer evil this movie gets that message across in a unique way of pulling together the worlds best superheroes iron man captain america thor black widow hawkeye and the hulk all the characters have been previously developed through other marvel movies which will help your understanding of this movie a lot more if you watch them in advance also it never fails to amaze me how marvel always manages to work in the cameo appearance of their founder and comic book writer stan lee i look for him in ever marvel movie now the overall basis of the movie is that loki thors not so nice little brother is trying to take by the tesseract a blue cube that is an energy source and can connect multiple worlds shield led by nick fury pulls together the best superheroes to protect all people from loki through a complicated but well scripted and funny plot the movie ends in a huge battle which youll have to watch the movie to see how that goes it really is a great movie with a well planned out cast and an amazing script one of my favorite quotes is there is only one god maam and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that said by captain america so surprising that modern hollywood will still say something towards christianity it was refreshing overall an amazing way to kill a couple of hours i recommend it to anyone who likes action with a side of comedy,fantasy
i challenge anyone who did not or does not think this was a 1010 film to make a better version people especially picky ones just like to nitpick for the sake of doing so when i saw this film i did not even go in expecting to be blown away or anything but that happened any way and so much more marvels assemble was such and ambitious project because they were tasked with not only bringing together some of the greatest superheroes every written but also making it work each one of these heroes thor captain america iron man black widow hawk eye the hulk can helm and deliver their own action packed titular vehicle in their own right so taming the egos which did flare up during the course of the film long enough to get the job done was also a commendable task that was accomplished here as was the amazing chemistry shared among all the cast members centering the main plot around the alien force of energy known as the tesseract which has been a subject in other marvel flicks was also brilliant the subplots of natashas skill set loki playing up the hulk and nick fury and the shields insidious agenda for regaining the tesseract were also spot on iron mantony starks amazing oneliners had me in stitches he was even funnier here than he is in his own movies,fantasy
this is singlehandedly one of the best if not the best superhero movies in history not just by the shear story and acting but by so many actors most of them very good ones in general who play those characters so great they are specifically cast to be those characters which we can really see movie of course as any other has its quirks and mistakes but to a true fan of scifi in general especially to the marvel fans this will be in their top 5 movies list this movie isnt piece of film art but it is not intended to be either and this review is written from that perspective acting is really good and one of the main reasons is that almost all actors already had their movies or were part in marvel movie so they are used to marvel universe another reason is that all actors are really good and are getting along really well special effects are also amazing and they have enormous contact with environment and it is hard to distinguish is it really happening or not sfx are going to draw you even more into the movie i watched it hundred times and i cant get enough i recommend it to anyone who likes genres like this and to ones who just want to have plain old fun,fantasy
the is an actionpacked superherofilled film that focuses on the peacekeeping shield agency bringing together iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson the incredible hulk mark ruffalo and hawkeye jeremy renner to create the when earth is threatened by thors brother loki the must unite to save the planet from catastrophe full of impressive visuals and action in nearly every scene this film is fast paced and exciting throughout with plenty to keep you guessing the final battle is epic in every sense impressive cgi mixes with the new york skyline as the lead the fight against evil in a thrilling chase across the city the story itself pulls in elements from each of the individual stories in particular iron man 2008 thor 2011 and captain america 2011 i may be slightly biased in saying this as they are my favourite so i notice the references more and id highly recommend watching the individual films although they are not a necessary prerequisite the casting is first class each character is a contrast to the next downey jr as the egotistical genius iron man evans as the charming and heroic oldfashioned captain america hemsworth as the tough brave demigod thor johansson as the smart feisty black widow ruffalo as the quiet but unstoppable hulk and renner as the quick deadly hawkeye what really makes this story is how all of these characters learn to use each others strengths as the plot unfolds and each is as important to the team as the next when it comes to the crunch tom hiddleston is deviously wicked as loki delivering an impressively smooth and convincing performance as the enemy of the story samuel l jackson brings his usual mysterious nick fury providing many unexpected laughs from the delivery of his characters oneliners fans of other marvel work will recognise supporting characters played by the likes of clark gregg cobie smulders stellan skarsgard and gwyneth paltrow assemble is yet another example of the great work that marvel can produce with a fast paced and exciting story that encompasses their best characters definitely one to watch and if you havent already seen some of the individual characters films this film will probably make you want more theres only one question that plagues me when i watch this film would i want to be saved from near death by iron man or captain america having seen the incredible new captain america the winter soldier recently which i cant recommend highly enough im going with the captain for now,fantasy

in joss whedons the three marvel comics superheroes  iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans and the hulk mark ruffalo  are recruited by shield to do battle against loki tom hiddleston the brother of thor chris hemsworth who has come to earth with an alien army to claim the world for his own but can three such distinctly talented yet strongwilled individuals put aside their differences and egos long enough to function as a team  as the  to save the planet theres no question that gathering three classic superheroes into a single film was a stroke of marketing genius as well as a considerable treat for fans the movie itself is lively loud and epic in scale with just enough character delineation to keep us engaged on a human level plus it culminates in a spectacular jamboree of destruction in new york city that turns into a veritable valhalla for cgi aficionadosall the abovementioned actors enter into the spirit of the enterprise as do scarlett johansson jeremy renner clark gregg samuel l jackson gwyneth paltrow powers boothe jenny agutter and harry dean stanton as the pure humans in the castgood fun,fantasy

this is by far my favorite film of all time im a big comic book geek and when i watch this film i felt as if i was reading an amalgamation of the ultimates and the early 616 the cast is excellent the story is simple but affective the easter eggs are brilliant and the action is amazing its fun but not in a stupid way like michael bays transformers this is a film that must be seen by any person whos a fan of comics or cartoons or just wants to watch a fun movie without turning off their brain everyone does an amazing job especially mark ruffalo who i prefer over edward norton and eric bana so if you havent seen it then get off youre chair and see it,fantasy

the end of phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe this movie stars of all 5 marvel heroes as loki wants the tesseract as he comes to earth and starts a war with all of these different aliens and creatures as well i went to see this film with high expectations and what happened my expectations were met all of it every single part of the movie this movie made me love the characters more than ever i mean robert downey jr in my opinion was the best actor for marvel i mean no one else can really play iron man like he can i thought samuel l jackson did a fantastic job as nick fury he really added the tension and added that comic book type in himself as it seems now how good was this movie its just not really good it is amazing the special effects were good the acting was good the directing and the editing was very well put together spoilers ahead hulk was by far the most interesting and most fun character in the movie this is the best hulk yet although i was kind of disappointed by how hulk did not get much screen time as much of the other characters did some other minuses that i didnt like is that there are some parts where i got a little too winded out from all the action and yes thats my favorite kind of action but i felt like there were a little too much of it there were lots of elements that were built into this movie where you can feel and see all of them it does has its funny moments which i really like because without that element of laughter it would be too serious and i thought that they did really well with that part as for the setting i felt like there wasnt a lot of setting involved which means not whole lot to remember forever but that is easily missed the last one is the antagonist loki i think that he should be a villain in every marvel film just because he is very enjoyable to watch on screen has great talent and great acting skills so overall this movie is breathtaking exciting dazzling i would really recommend this movie to all ages really i give this a 810 good job marvel,fantasy
marvels the is nothing short of an amazing movie if theres anything i can say its that it is the best superhero movie i have seen not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character despite the big cast its good that we get to see our favorite heroes iron man thor captain america and hulk all join forces to defeat evil amazing indeed joss whedons film is about how our favorite heroes form an alliance called shield and their mission is to stop loki thors halfbrother from destroying new york city and the rest of the worldthis film boasts an impressive cast indeed robert downey jr is here and witty as usual chris evans as capt america is great and a good leader chris hemsworth as thor is very good mark ruffalo as the hulk was an interesting casting choice but it works out tom hiddleston as thor is a slimy sarcastic guy but he makes a great villain on a side note one of my favorite scenes involves a confrontation between loki and hulkoverall this is one amazing superhero movie its funny actionpacked and emotional the final 45 minutes is just great with all the action scenes this movie is essentially transformers but with a better story this movie has me waiting for the sequel and subsequent spinoffs a word to dc fans who hate this film just because its from marvel its a great filmjust like the batman films this is one impressive actionpacked visuallythrilling and emotionprovoking film i rate this film 1010,fantasy
if you are a fan of the than you wont be disappointed this movie is like a sequel for iron man captain america thor and hulk all together a lot of action story is quite good and when ive watched it i was 100 into it no boring moments in the movie there was no favoring of heroes every one of them got their part in the movie and they all have done a brilliant job if youve never watched movies with heroes than you should really start asap iron man movies have started all of this so you should start with that and enjoy in brilliance of tony stark in performance of robert downey jr which was perfect for the role of tony stark and my personally favorite avenger thor is also incredible chris hemsworth really nailed it and this movie is like quite important for the story in the so you shouldnt been missing this one and captain america is just quite interesting cause he is actually the first hero of the franchise who even went to fight in the world war ii and naturally theres no person who doesnt like hulk and mark ruffalo is the best hulk so far i just cant wait for second and third movie because its just gonna be better and better enjoy,fantasy
from the beginning in the movie the there is an ongoing battle between an agency called shield and the evil loki after taking a staff with an unlimited amount of power called the tesseract loki planed on opening a portal to allow aliens to invade earth but the team shield had other plans and launched project recruiting the marvel super heroes of earth iron man aka tony starks the incredible hulk aka dr bruce banner thor aka god of lightning captain america aka steve rodgers hawkeye aka clinton barton and black widow aka natalia romanova to stop loki and his alien army from taking over earth and possibly destroying it i was impressed in how well they did in bringing all the characters together and connecting their story lines one way or another a good example of how some the characters story line connected in the is tony starks aka iron mans dad was a great scientistinventor he was the genius that was able to turn steve rodgers into captain america and giving him his powers by experimenting on him making him into a great success tony knew very well about captain america because of his dad telling stories about him years on down the road a scientist tried to recreate the experiment on bruce banner that was done to steve rodgers and gave him his powers but it went wrong causing him to change in to the incredible hulk when he gets angry thors dad basically adopted loki when he was a baby making loki thors brothers thor was chosen by his dad to be the god of lightning and the protector of earth where all the live all the characters had their own individual story line but somewhere in the line they connected to each other some more than othersthe reason the were brought together was because loki came through a portal in to the base of shield to take the powerful tesseract so they made it their mission to recruit the to stop him from continuing with his plan it wasnt easy convincing them but they all had their own motives as to why the thought they should help save the world they had been keeping up with all the heroes without them know in case of a global emergency like this bruce asked black widow how did you find me and she responded we never lost you we have been keeping up with you he was not real easy to convince to help but they really need him on their team iron man was not very hard to find but he found his own reasons to team up with the and save the world after missing out on the first war he fought in captain america did want to miss out on this battle so he was ready to fight with the team thor saw the evil his brother loki was causing and decided to join the in a battle against him that is how the got brought together after having their story lines crossbefore all the characters got together to become the they all had their own movie telling their own story line as to how they got their powers and got where they were all their story lines crossed each other at some point some more than others but at the end they all got brought together by team shield the epic battle of having to stop the evil loki and his alien army from taking over earth is what brought all the heroes together at the end of it all even though some of the stories were connecting more than others they all got connected by the battle equally with each character having their own role the connection between the characters was well plotted out in this movie,fantasy
the delivers on being a great superhero movie with quality special effects and an entertaining plot while also making the audience laugh throughout the entire movie the opening scene causes suspense with a very dark scene of loki being given his scepter by his master it also shows their creepy looking army and their goal of capturing the tesseract a cube of great power the line of what can the humans do but burn foreshadows that they are going attack the humans loki uses his scepter and the power of the tesseract to teleport from asgard to earth he then steals the tesseract from the humans this causes the director of shield nick fury to call together all of the worlds superheroes these heroes are iron man the hulk captain america hawkeye thor and black widow and they try to stop loki and his chitauri army from taking over the world while also dealing with internal conflicts between heroes the introduction of the is very well done because they show each one being recruited back into the they do a great job of incorporating the backstories of each one by referencing their individual movies the dialogue is used to explain each heros background to the audience so it would appeal to everyone and not just hardcore comic and superhero fans flashbacks are used to explain some details of the past histories of the characters loki and captain america both have flashbacks and captain americas shows his past experience with the tesserract the special effects are used to make the scifi parts of the movie seem possible the blue cube of the tesseract is beautifully created with blue swirls inside of it the transformation of bruce banner into the hulk is very well done with him going mad and then slowly growing into the hulk and the hulk looks giant ripped and very green when he is smashing everything the futuristic looking ships and aircraft are made to look very complex by having very detailed electronic and mechanical parts and the helicarrier is a great example because it is an aircraft carrier that turns into a flying helicopter ship with four giant engines the movie also includes plenty of comic relief phil coulson is asking captain america if he will sign his vintage collection of captain america cards every time he sees him there is a great moment when one of the workers on the helicarrier is playing galaga instead of working and tony stark calls him out for it the constant references of modern things like stephen hawking made to captain america are funny because he doesnt understand any of them some of the most memorable moments are comic relief moments with captain america ordering hulk to smash before the final battle and when loki gives his little speech to the hulk and then the hulk picks him up and smashes him into the ground multiple times the shows that superhero movies can also be funny,fantasy
this was not a standalone film this was the culmination of 5 excellent superhero films in their own right the build up was cleverly done with small bits and pieces here and there involving nick fury agent coulson etc for people who had seen the other films no character intro was needed but there was still easily enough development within the film itself for newcomers to get to know each character enough to see their importance in the team the story was good with all actors involved putting in fantastic performances mark ruffalo was an excellent new hulk even the smaller characters such as coulson were put forward well for example in coulsons case development through the previous films culminating in his very emotional death or not agents of shield i was amazed at how they managed to portray all of the main characters individual struggles in such a short space of time this made you feel even more for the characters as the film developed of course what the majority of people are looking for in superhero films is action we got that the alien invasion was done superbly and on an epic scale this film is brilliant for people who know their superheroes or people who dont i loved it and so will most who see it bring on the next round of films and age of ultron,fantasy
this was another one of my most favorite flicks of all time a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat and finding it hard to hit the pause button to go do what comes needed after several cold refreshmentsi appreciate the serious side of the movie with the battle scenes but for me what was more enjoyable was the comedic parts that kept me interested and laughing at just the right timesthe special effects and sound score was something worth mentioning and i would suggest turning the lights down low and cranking up the surround sound whilst watching this epic tale pulled straight from the comic books of marvel,fantasy
i will not say that its a good movie its a great movie all the casts did a wonderful job to bring these heroic characters to life it was not just the best superhero movie made starting with robert downey jr who seemed to slip through scene to scene he played almost fluently providing his lines with virtually eases providing his charisma personality and smugness to brighten up the well 2 hrs movie is wellpaced and time quickly flew by the effects were topnotch and the performance was quite good the script is the main part that drives the whole movie in elevating manner for those people who have not seen any other movie we are bringing enough information to bring everybody to momentum the movie provides more than normal comic book movie but the story with cause that was backed up with unbelievable humor and actionthe was greatly entertaining all the action scenes were great and satisfyingno one is short changed during the action or fighting scene not a single scene looked bad to me a few dialogs seemed off but once you recall the character it all makes perfect sense every respective characters is honest and true to itself everyone brought up their persona to the movie and definitely it is the best marvel movie till now superheroes want super troubles to resolve to shine up each hero in this movie has to handle some sort of problem to its personal super power only by working as a team they can conquer the evil threats one of the best things in this great movie is the utilization of the leather jackets got its success with the use of attractive leather jackets worn by different characters to uplift their personality desert leather is the manufacturer of quality hollywood style jackets as worn in every blockbuster movie this super hit and memorable movie easily satisfied the expectations needed i simply loved this wonderful movie which covers all point of views and delivers its depth with entertainment i dont hesitate to give it a good 810,fantasy
bringing earths mightiest heroes together was a brilliant idea as i have never seen a better superhero movie like it and in the bright action world of marvel watch the heroes do whats best from each individual as they all have their fair share of screen time such as iron man being cocky captain america being heroic thor bringing the lightning and of course hulk smash i couldnt hate a minuet of it and its always a great film when you want to see more at the endthe only criticism i could barely dig out from the depths of my thoughts was stan lee could of had a better cameo but sometimes life doesnt go that way but if you can get over a 89 year old man having a short part that lasted 4 seconds then you will appreciate this amazing film if you want a good time to spend some hours gazing at the first film to unite multiple heroes to one universe then this is it,fantasy
i can say that my life was practically ruined by the i love them all of them especially thor love the fact that they put in mark ruffalo as hulk he is the perfect fit also colbie smulders is perfect for her role loki is a natural even though he auditioned for thor in the first place robert downey jr will always and forever be one of the most amazing people i have ever seen acting and well chris hemsworth is and should always be thor he is perfect for the role and there isnt anybody who would play it better than him i loved the movie and right now im dying inside it is an obvious 10 out of 10 and if i could a 1000000 out of 10 amazing,fantasy
in 18 months on imdb this is my first review i was scrolling through imdb for some background and stumbled into the user review section of the first 20 or so it seemed 15ish rated this film a 1 shocked i actually put down my phone paused the movie and fired up my computer just to write my first review of any film i am more than willing to concede to the negative posters that the storyline is relatively predictable however i cannot fathom why they think it would be so easy to weave a complex story arc like those found in dark knight star wars or others mentioned that could adequately involve 4 super heroes 3 heroes 15 bad guys and assorted support cast and come in under 5 hours how could anyone possibly write a batmanjokerdent relationship that applied to all of the just look at how much reel time it took to develop the batmanbane relationship in dkr if i were to judge this effort solely on originality i probably wouldnt give it a 10 either however i firmly believe that mr whedon and company did an excellent job integrating all of the characters into an action packed story that still manages to touch if not address various flaws of numerous characters i further dismiss the opinions that say there are no unexpected plot twists in the story the death of coulson stands out immediately to me  a beloved character from previous movies also i think he manages to further develop fury romanoff and barton despite the limited time in a movie such as this obviously i think the movie was a great success and hope others will at least give it a look despite the more recent negative feedback if i had one complaint i think that the scenes cut involving steve rogers character should have been left in the original probably not something mr whedon wanted left out either but the extra 56 minutes should have made it past the editors,fantasy
let me reiterate 10 line minimum impractical and extremely annoying minimum and maximum amt of words that is truly a lame brain policy topic of thor how much common sense did stan lee put into creating this particular comic book hero norse gods are nothing more than superstitious mythstheology far more rational to believe these ancient stories are based off how man at the time perceived the science of older races with far more advanced technology science will eventually disprove the existence of gods and a high percentage of ancient mysteries that some attribute to aliens or time travelers here is a theory it is believed in the scientific community that life evolved and perished repeatedly over the past 4 billion yrs what if not all those who evolved to create their own technology died out they would be so advanced they would easily be able to hide among society today witless faith people as in jehova or anyone else who quote their particular religious text chapter and verse wake up those disasters conveyed in religious texts are bunk again all can rationally be explained through science in this case natural disasters maybe that is why we are not forced to actually make sacrifices to these alleged gods because they sympathize with us because they can still recall when they were much like us the truly godlike do not expect to be worshiped as for the character of loki if norse mythstheology is based on advanced beings from space or remnants of past advanced earth civilizations i like to think of the star trek animated episode of the enterprise traveling to the center of the galaxy and the crew finding themselves in a dimension where things can be created merely by ones thoughts in preceding mentioned sttas the character loki who was also lucifer or should i say the patron saint of enlightenment was actually much more like thor seeing potential in the inhabitants of our planet to grow and become compassionately wise fact be told the tora most likely describes satan as wicked because he did not see the logic in keeping mortals ignorant whether it means complete peace or not alright that is enough about viking gods and mythstheology when did david middle name or not david at least is a respectable sounding name bruce sounds like a name that should be applied to the mentally deficient such as your christian coalition inbred hillbilly redneck type much like the name douglas where you feel tempted to say dougie or doogie might as well say doobie because you would expect someone with such a stupid sounding name to have zero brain wave activity such as person high on thc digress again which 1 is compelled to do from the start  10 line minimum i have never been much of a reader of comic books more important things to save what little money i had on but shame on the screen writers of this movie from what i know about the fictitious character of the hulk all texts cast dr david bruce bannerhulk as a dr of medicine more precisely biochemistgeneticist and possibly microbiologist in this movie he was no more than a physicist which means he would have no chance of curing his genetic mutation since 1 would not only need to have some knowledge in physics but more so in biochemistry and genetics confused as to the part of the part where nick fury is explaining to steve rogers about the hulk being created out scientific research related to the technique that create him come on now scientific knowledge of the first half of the 20th century if you exposed anyone to gamma radiation with what little knowledge was known about effects of any given amount throughout much of the 20th century they would have died from radiation poisoning considering there has been so much talk about the dangers of radio waves electromagnetism judged from people who have been exposed to radar type devices or high levels of electromagnetism such as high voltage power lines transformers without sufficient research you will die banners survival was because his nucleotides were rearranged in a fashion that prevented the radiation levels from killing him what is the source of this version of bannerhulk constant anger being that this is an entirely different dr banner history from previous story lines the dr david banner of the television series suffered from far more heartache than this 1 wait do not tell me loki will be spewing hatred for his adoptive asgard brother thor and asgard alike along with his condescending loathing of us worthless mortal humans wreaking havoc and being responsible for more death and destruction damn either kill the character off or scatter his subatomic particles across the vastness of space he is an imminent threat to mortals just as muslims are an imminent threat to those who do not adhere to the same religious doctrine as them do i detest the muslim faith damn straight i do because no other religion is followed by people as ignorant andor state of denial of its origins as them my 2 favorite scenes is where steve rogers aka captain america turns to the hulk to provide tactical strategy and says hulk carefully choosing words smash in response the hulk smiles and later in the movie where the hulk is confronting loki again in an arrogant soliloquy and again proclaims he is a god indirectly insinuating mortals exist solely for his amusement and the hulk grabs him smashing body against the floor andor walls in response and says puny god,fantasy
to start out the casting was phenomenal mark ruffalo was thought to be a poor choice for the hulk but after seeing him in action the thought had left everyones mind edward norton a great hulk himself would not have fit in with the team now that i even try to think of it i think this film would not have been nearly as great with him in itas for the rest of the cast it was well rounded well written and was fairly proportioned considering the size of the team no single actor got too much screen time not even top billed robert downey jr joss whedon did a spectacular job no one couldve done better he had the perfect balance of each character as well as the perfect balance of action and comedy this film was amazing from start to finish if you didnt like it you probably dont like fun,fantasy
the is one of the best action movies ive ever seen honestly i didnt mind but didnt really appreciate the marvel films until i saw this the characters good and bad were great and the whole thing really flows nicely the movie has its fast and slow parts but nevertheless it never gets boring and worth watching more than once in fact i saw this many times in the theater another thing is the humor brought into this it isnt a dark or very scary film and even if you dont like it or the humor just isnt funny to you there are some scenes that are so funny everyone is laughing ahem hulk and loki the actors really portray their characters nicely and the whole thing is simply great i have no issues with this film besides a few scenes that involve people busting through glass such as tony stark and hawkeye technically stark would have died but that is to be expected in these kind of films this is truly in my opinion the best superhero movie ever,fantasy
the has gotten a lot of praise much of which it rightly deserves but the plot is somewhat uninspired its your classic comic book movie formula with an evil villain who wants to take over the earth and a team of superheroes is the only thing that stands in his way but that isnt really what the film is about anyway the presence of the evil villain merely serves as a means to an end in this case the end being the assembly of the an event the previous films have all been leaving up to and while the plot is predictable and could have been a lot more innovative the way the characters are brought together is handled masterfullythis brings me to the actors and the cast in the is superb uniting the cast of all the independent previous films with the exception of edward norton who was sadly unable to reprise his role from the incredible hulk 2008 the consists of an all star cast whose performances are definitely largely the reason why this film is so goodthe main reason however for the being the success that it is is the director joss whedon was the perfect choice for this film for one reason above all others he has the talent to create a fantastic on screen chemistry between characters with very different lifestyles while seeing iron man robert downey jr and captain america chris evans having an argument is a terrific crossover moment on its own whedons sense for chemistry really makes scenes such as this stand out where others might fail to do socombining this with fast paced intense action scenes with amazing special effects makes for a visual thrill ride however whedon also never forgets what the film is really about these superheroes from across space and time coming together to fight a common enemythe result a well balanced well paced blockbuster that also has a lot of heart and for me this more than makes up for the superficial plot especially considering the amount of work time and money marvel has invested in these films making sure everything ties in and adds up all leading up to thiswhen it first came out a lot of people were afraid that the could not live up to the expectations raised by the other films in my opinion not only does it live up to the expectations it exceeds themyou wont be disappointed by this film however i strongly recommend you watch the other films first to really be able to appreciate the masterpiece that the entire series is,fantasy
marvels super heroes iron man hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow take place in this movie when an enemy shows up unexpectedly and treats the future of the world nick fury needs a team to set everything right and adventure begins it must be so difficult to throw together these heroes in order to film because firstly to organize their relationships and conflicts with good dialogs is essentialand secondly visuality hulk and iron man are the visual effects heroes is a magnificent scenario which is almost no impeccable moreover it gets get the most out of visuality till the end of the film successfully scarlett johanson and robert downey jrs performs are amazing in this filmthis case is even enough for watching it enjoy the movie,fantasy
as the title to this review says so much could have gone wrong however nothing did in fact it was the best movie of 2012 until the dark knight rises came out but thats a whole nother story although the plot was a downfall the action and the perfect screentime for each of the heroes redeemed it also the camera angles are so unique that you just have to appreciate the movie more if you liked iron man iron man 2 thor captain america the first avenger or the incredible hulk you will love this movie also they change hulk for the better so now he becomes the hulk when he gets mad not when his heart rate goes up and he was more there for comedy however the climax and the way they solved the problem was bad just having iron man fly up into the oblivion of space well actually that part was okay but when he came back down to earth he was unconscious so hulk stomped and roared to wake him up although it was funny not exactly the way i would like iron man to be revivedthis brings me to another point this movie was very funny im not saying that it was funny for children no it was funny for all ages with hulks anger getting in the way with some people ie thor and just some jokes that were sprinkled into the conversations throughout the movieoverall this movie is great it is actionpacked fun for kids and pretty much any other family member and it is for a change funny although the plot and the climax is a potential downfall that should not stop you from seeing this movie,fantasy
the is one of the most talked about films in recent memory especially when it made such an explosion at the box office the was breaking and creating box office records left right and centre the you would think would be an interesting idea if done right and it most certainly has beenthere are 6 members and there master nick fury which you would think with all the characters history and really complex individual story lines it would just be a great big mess just trying to fit them all in equally and there lives to fit into the story which is surprisingly done well but could be betteralthough the does great at fitting the characters in that isnt always the case on some occasions such as bruce which is the hulk is given a more of a side character feel such as his dilemma being the hulk and given into anger is sidestepped a bit there are inconsistencies in the story for example during the beginning they build up bruces character slightly when not giving in to one liners and action movie formula clichs bruce has to deal with his hulk anger issues and attacks the female avenger but later is completely in control out of the blue which isnt bad it could probably have been done better and built up morethe movie of course does have some shinning lights in the picture iron man and thor clearly take front row in the story due to thor having family issues with the antagonist to resolve and iron mans very big charismatic personality is hard to ignore and could be seen to take some of the spotlight in the moviethe american avenger possibly needs more conflict in this movie like dealing with the modern day world or having a deep connection with somebody he didnt just share less than 1 minute of screen time the american avenger is just the usual possible leader figure of the group that is just there to deliver one liners and be the conflict with iron manthe avenger with the cross bow didnt really have a developed background in comparison with the others but did instill some form of sub plot that could have probably been done without to be fair even though well performed it wouldnt of made a real difference if he wasnt there he doesnt add to the story and has next to no real conflict to speak ofnick fury which is performed by samuel l jackson which really does suit the role and definitely needed more screen time as this was simply the best actor in the film and the films greatest asset there is hope that in the next film of the there will be more conflict and story for this character nick fury wasnt well developed in his background and didnt really have enough to do but was performed brilliantlythe portrayal of loki was an excellent role for the unknown actor tom hiddleston and really excelled at being the vengeful younger brother this role probably would have been more fun if he had played to more humourits not that like hes the god of mischief or anything instead we got a more one dimensional character that was bitter jealous and ambitious which was just about itthe script itself was not flawless there were a good few plot holes and a few lazy and convenient plot point to carry the story forward the villain leader of the mighty alien army that the was fighting and what seemed dark and mysteries figure the villain came and looked like he could double cross loki at any time and what seemed like a very fragile alliance came to nothinga waste of a very potentially brilliant story arkthe film you could argue didnt really have enough tension in the story the story possibly made it a bit to easy for the heroes and during the conflict they had the attitude as if it was a sports match instead of the end of the world dilemma so there was no real fear dread or relevant emotion from the heroes and just stayed in the comfort zone characters the villain loki could have been made better if he had been a bit more humourful instead of the stubborn whiny i want power now attitudethe cgi in the film was amazing and used really well not to the point its shoved in your face or there is to much going on in the background to notice it the cgi was used really well and found the right balance with making the dangers threatening and not overcrowding the whole scene with explosions in every street corner until the audience get bored the fireworks if overused to the point of having the same affects as sparklers on the big screen as the novelty wears offthe was a great film not a flawless film and certainly no where near the hype it was given the film is family friendly and does have a few good characters and a paced developing story the film is something worth noting as a film that is definitely worth seeing not going as far as saying unmissable and does get to slow at some points but all in all worth catching if you have timethis film is a good 7 out of 10 and definitely recommended film to see but could be considered overrated to much hype and a dab of the novelty effect,fantasy
my other favourite superhero films are those of the dark knight trilogy and as they are so dark its nice to watch a film which is more light hearted although verging on corny the humour was good and the story gripping although fairly standard the character relationships are great and mark ruffalo is particularly good as the hulk all the acting is pretty secure and the effects good all the actors suit their roles and bring together a successful film on a group of heroes sounds easier than it is the score is great and the only problem being that the story isnt as innovative as it could be but thats not to worry as your still in for thrilling watch,fantasy
this is definitely my favorite movie of all the superhero genre jos whedon did a masterclass balancing act between all the characters and not once did i feel that one character was favored over the others this movie is worth seeing for all the actors and the hulk is a smash hit as i am sure youve already heard the special effects were nothing short of legendary with very little leaked before the release making this a refreshing new take on the superhero movies and stetting a whole new standard that those that follow on from this are going to find hard to beat it was great how marvel have taken these comic book characters and made them believable and not some dandies in fancy dress charades from the eighties roll on the 2nd installment of this eagerly anticipated franchise well done jos,fantasy
i have never really been into the whole super hero movie type of thing but in my opinion the is a great action movie i like that all the characters had a major role to play whedon didnt leave nobody out or behind i liked how splendid the graphics were and how it just makes the movie more liver my favorite character in the is the hulk i like how he tries to remain in control then after a while all of a sudden something just sets him off on a rage the whole action scene is just to live from the graphics to the hulk ripping thing out of the walls and throwing them the whole idea of this movie is excellent i love the plot love the themes and i especially love how each character had something to offer to catch the audience attention almost immediately thumbs up to whedon great job,fantasy
 initiative the is an action packed film that leaves one asking for more this film takes your classic comic book heroes and brings them to life on the big screen from the very beginning the characters are already set in place previous movies that is right if you dont want to be lost you unfortunately have some homework to do first this should not be too difficult of a task marvel takes many of their beloved heroes and puts them all together in a super powered formula this team is a time bomb just waiting to explode the characters are as different as night and day which causes many clashes from physical beat downs to witty and comical banter between them all the heroes have one common goal that in the end brings them all together the fight for the greater good the stakes are set high from the very beginning this allows one no time to be distracted you have loki who is a constant threat weather manipulated others or fighting himself this villain allows the watcher to be on their toes in order to know what he is really doing he also has a slow developing scheme that becomes steadily more known and dangerous as the plot develops one of the most interesting things about this movie is the character interactions these vary from violent and destructive fights to hysterical jokes there is tony stark iron man a brilliant business man that is often betrayed as a large rich child he knows all technologies and yet pokes and jabs at bruce banner to see if it will release the hulk bruce banner who is very seemingly calm at all times has as stark puts it a big green rage monster waiting to come out yet he has his secret of keeping the hulk under control he is angry all the time you have the super soldier that is very lost in a modern day society an alien named thor who blames himself for bringing this whole situation upon the earth then last but not least black widow who you never know what she is going to do as great as the is it does have its flaws if one does not know the characters nor seen the movies leading up to the they dont know much about them in the movie they are all already developed giving someone very little room to learn who they all are most of this movie is one action seen into the next leaving little time to add to the plot in between next to these few flaws the is a fantastic film that takes many extraordinary fictional people and makes them feel real as the person sitting next you,fantasy
from the opening scene to the final seconds marvels the is an action packed thrill ride thatll leave you begging for more the overall storyline is nothing special bad guy wants to rule the world using and alien army but the true genius of lies in its execution joss whedon moves the movie along at a pace that leaves the audience without a feeling of being rushed the threat is quickly established but a majority of the time is spent assembling the team though at first one is quick to point out that this tactic would lengthen the movie and draw things out in a bore it is another credit to the directingwriting of whedon by slowly introducing each character we are better able to see each heros personality bounce of the others in a sort of entertaining experiment that takes place right before our eyesa good super hero movie often hinges on its villain the dark knights joker and it isnt an easy task to make the audience doubt the heroes ability to come out on top especially when there are six of them but loki played by tom hiddleston acts the part to perfection and speaking of acting it would appear that the third time is in fact the charm as no one could have predicted the show stealing performance by mark ruffalo as the hulk who succeeded where eric bana and edward norton could not his role as the cool calculating scientist with a touch of emotional instability im always angry was highly engaging as for the rest of the cast they benefited from the group dynamic each hero was the star of his own movie and when they come together their respective egos clash resulting in action such as the fight between robert downey jrs iron man and chris hemsworths thor or hilarity in the case of iron man calling captain america played by chris evans old manamongst all the stars of the movie there is still one more the special effects delivering one the best action movies of the year could not be possible without serious cgi and delivers in outstanding fashion from the ascension of shields mother ship to the moment the alien armys arrival in new york the art department shows it has what it takes to compete with the likes of michael bay and christopher nolan the hulk is brought to life in astounding realism as well as the character many forget isnt real either iron manas a whole there is little that can be said against whedons new masterpiece the expectations of every comic book fan and superhero movie buff must have hung heavy on his shoulders the buildup to this was unlike anything ever seen in hollywood whedon in his magnum opus reveals himself to be the true hero of the,fantasy
marvels the sounded like a movie that i would just not be in to because of the fact that it has to do with a bunch of superheroes but all in to one movie to be honest that is just not my kind of movie once it was announced in our class that we would be watching it i was not excited at all all i thought was that i was really going to be bored and just want to sleep the whole time but that was not the case the movie really was intriguing and really snatched your attention right upthe fact that joss whedon was able to put all of the superhero movies that everybody knows and loves all in to one movie and make it all fall into place without changing any of the characters in anyways was really a great thing the movie also was just not an ordinary action filled movie with the same old action that all those types of movies carry it had so much more and was so much more advanced in every single way the graphics the special effects the fighting scenes and every little detail was so precise and on target nothing ever let me down in this movie that i thought should change or be different all in all now when it comes down to this type of movie i know i will not judge it just because of the fact that it is an action filled movie that comes from comic books because who knows it could be really good just like the wasthe only bad review that i would give the movie is that in the beginning it was a little hard to follow especially if you are person watching it for the first time and dont really follow all of the other movies that are put in to it my only advice would be in the beginning to show who the characters are and what they were all about so some of the viewers watching the movie for the first time can follow a little easier and not have to take the time to figure out what exactly is happening and who the people are that are playing the characters like iron man captain america the hulk and etc at first in the movie i didnt know what actor was playing the hulk so that really confused me over all this movie was a really great action packed movie that portrayed to be a really good attention grabber,fantasy
the was a good movie but took a little while to get into at first i was very confused seeing as i have not watched any of the other marvel movies nothing was really explained as to who the characters were and what their importance was it was just assumed that you knew as i was watching the movie i asked many questions to my companions and needed things to be explained to me in order to understand everything that was going on without these people to clear things up i may not have understood a good portion of the movie which would have made it boring and uninteresting for me to watch as the movie began things jumped around a lot which made the storyline hard to follow characters were bouncing around from place to place and new people were being brought into the story without any real introduction or reason further into the movie everything came together and was more understandable but they could have done a better job writing the beginning again without explanations from the people i was with i would not have understood exactly where the character were coming from and why they were being brought it the only reason a person would not like the in my opinion would be because they had not seen previous marvel movies in which these characters were featured once things were explained to me and i understood the role each character played it was a very good and entertaining movie the plot kept twisting and just when you thought something was under control it spiraled off into a huge mess things such as the villain freezing himself and collecting more and more power or such as the people he turned evil becoming good again just in time to help save the day it is an action packed movie with something new and unexpected going on at all times all of the superheroes come together in order to stop an ultrapowerful force from outer space but their ideas and morals clash in ways that could inhibit them from making clear decisions and in the end saving the world besides personality clashes the hulk is also unable to control his powers and becomes a threat to everyone when he morphs into his large green alter ego and begins to tear the place apart this nerve wrecking movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and you watch hoping that everyone can get along in time to defeat the villain,fantasy
the is a behemoth of action that comic nerds and casual moviegoers alike can enjoy in the same vein its not only action packed but the humor and the script altogether was well written and compliments each character completely for example captain america speaks like how you would think a bit dated not exactly knowing much of his surroundings yet he speaks as anybody who just woke up from being frozen for seventy odd years bruce banner also known as the hulk speaks in a sort of timid nervous way he mumbles a bit and is constantly scared that something will happen that makes him very very angry mark ruffalo the actor who plays bannerhulk pulls this off gracefully as he truly is bruce and not just an actor playing him brilliant performances from the cast are a major driving point for this movie tony stark is as sarcastic and witty as he normally is thor is awkward with his mythos and his stories of battles and whatnot in fact thor would be the only character that sort of didnt mesh in with the rest of the team the actor who played him chris hemsworth didnt convince me that he was actually the character he was playing like everyone else did even though thor was powerful and awesome the actor who played him was a hit and miss for memore praises aside for the other actors the action of this movie raises the bar for how a superhero movie should be made explosions gun fights jets super powers and martial arts can make for a summer blockbuster if done right the is done right they do a good job in accurately showing each characters different abilities and strength levels in the fight between iron man and thor thor is clearly shown be stronger than iron mans armor but iron mans repulsors are shown be as powerful as they are in the comics knocking thor off of his feet hulk is portrayed as the unstoppable beast that he is utterly destroying everything in his path as he fights the alien antagonists of the movie he even pummels loki and to a much lesser extent thor who were both worshiped as gods at one point captain america black widow and hawkeye are shown to be proficient in martial arts and that shows that normal people can be a super hero toothe editing of the movie along with the plot action special effects and the pop culture references make this movie out to be one of my genuine favorites being a comic book fan i am truly pleased with this movie and im very excited for the future of marvel studios they pump out actionpacked super hero movies all the time and if the is any indication of whats to come they have my vote  plota  special effectsa  sounda  humora  real world referencesa  comic lorea,fantasy
hype was filled in the air as this starfilled action packed superhero movie was about to come to us theaters in my opinion all of the hype was delightfully fulfilled after its release the smashed the box office and grossed over 15 billion worldwide becoming the third highestgrossing film of all timelets first take a look at this allstar cast robert downey jr plays a billionaire playboy philanthropist named tony stark iron man this is the second best performance in a superhero type movie that i have ever seen next to heath ledger in the dark knight he brings a lot of wit and charisma to the film which is a big part why it became as successful as it was chris hemsworth plays thor who is the crown prince of asgard his spartanlike appearance and acting skills is the reason why i think chris was the perfect choice to play thor my favorite part is when thor fought with captain america due to captain america being chosen as the leader because it was so unexpected speaking of captain america steve rogers he is played by chris evans whose physic is perfect for this role his character is adequately developed throughout the movie mark ruffalos acting as the hulk dr bruce banner i thought was very good joss whedon got great use out of the hulk for the limited time he was in there the epic battle with loki at the end when the hulk smashes loki was a highlight of the film whedon use of the hulks strength is brilliant and even sometimes humorous scarlett johansson plays black widow natasha romanoff in the film her charm and sexy looks bode well with the character being a woman in superhero movie seems like it would be a tough challenge but she hit the nail on the coffin my favorite scene with her is when she is being violently interrogated by a trio of gangsters the gangsters reveal their master plan before johansson breaks out of the chair and takes down all three men this scene showed her amazing acrobatic abilityjeremy renner plays hawkeye a very skillful marksman he seemed to play this role very confidently and was almost flawless throughout the moviefor every superhero movie theres always a villain the villain in the is named loki and is played by tom hiddleston in my opinion his acting is superb he plays the character of a very menacing and mad manthe minor characters clark gregg as phil coulson samuel l jacksonasnick fury cobie smuldersasmaria hill and stellan skarsgardas drerik selvig are all decent at their respected roles although i think samuel l jackson should have had more airtime as the director of shield the plot unfolds very quickly in this actionpacked movie without spoiling the movie i will access the basic plot structure nick furry who is the leader of the peacekeeping agency known as shield and black widow have to assemble a special group to combat thors evil brother loki after he takes the cosmic cube and uses hisscepterto brainwash dr selvig and multiple agents includinghawkeye in order to help him in his getaway the heroes have a hard time working together but eventually learn how to bruce banner hulk plays an important role because he helps track down the artifacts gamma signals the plot is developed very nicely and is exactly what a superhero movie should bethe graphics and for this film is superb to say the least especially on blue ray the fact that most of the filming for this movie was actually filmed in a big city mostly new york and cleveland rather than a made up hollywood set gives it a feeling of realism and an illusion that the viewer is actually in the movie the special effects are second to none in the the huge explosions giant hole opening up in the air hawkeye falling out of the sky and shooting his arrow and hulk smashing loki are just a few of many excellent examples of amazing special effectsoverall i would give this film two thumbs up the flawless acting explosive plot superb graphics and excellent special effects all add up to a perfect superhero movie i would recommend this movie to any person who loves actionpacked superhero films,fantasy
the movie was not what i expected at first by watching it  i really thought it was a good action movie most action movies i have seen i thought this was one of my top movies by using the actors whedon has used made this movie even better the actors that played thorchris hemsworth hulk mark ruffalo captain americachris evans   iron man robert downey jr  black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner and lokitom hiddleston   worked really well together and got to show their own strength in the movie the evil loki didnt really get to show that much of his evil i think they should of showed more of his evil side it mostly looked like it followed the story line of thor because it was mostly about him and loki when i watched this black widow and haweye i didnt really know because they didnt have their own movie outside of this movie and i dont really read comics but by seeing this movie it made me want to watch more of this kind of movies i would watch this movie again the special effects were really good it went well with catching the audiences attention and to keep watching it i think they should of changed the setting of the battle that happened in manhattan where the bad guys went against the heroes the ending kind of made you think there was going to be a second one coming out and not leave you hanging like most other movies the best scene i think was the best in the movie was when all of them were stopping the portal thing that loki had opened and they all came togetherit showed how even though they have different techniques on fighting there enemy that can still help each other and defeat the enemy most people would like to watch this movie even if they arent into action movies,fantasy
the movie is a must see film for all viewers the allstar movie fulfilled the high expectations of the world most powerful superheroes saving the human racing within two minutes the movie quickly picks up after the selfsustaining energy force that is stolen by a semi god named loki as gripping as the story line starts off the special effects are just as spectacular the headquarters ship to aircraft sequence was breathtaking enough the effects were so realistic that it begged the question if such technology is real thors sex appeal is enough to keep the ladies watching with his hammer of steel lengthy hair and rugged style thors fight with captain america was certainly unexpected if anything we expected an allout war with the many quips that tony stark aka iron man flings around he brings comic relief to the otherwise tense cast dr bruce banner aka hulk is remaining calm as ever and typically does nothing for a good part of the movie besides fondle some technology and look busy every once in a while drbruce banner comes out of his office along with tony stark to explain the magnitude of the energy force and the some strategic advice later on he character becomes truly essential to defeating the bigger aliens captain america is almost as useless in the beginning because hes not up to date with any of the technology so he just sits around trying to grasp the concept most of the conversations between mr fury director of shield and the rest of the at one point he blurts out i get that i understand that phrase i do i get that one referring to a pun made by none other than mr stark we do however find out that captain america is arguably the wisest of the team somehow hes able to slide in some subtle wisdom like weve got to put that problems behind us and get this job done and sometimes there isnt a way out iron man earns the most improved award in this movie he goes from a rich selfabsorbed hero to a still rich now deserving the title hero sad to see but other characters didnt really change much during the film or grow in morals sometimes its nice to see such super heroes grow into better people along with the almost stationary characters the background didnt really changer either most of the action and plot took place of the aircraft the movie can be dwindled down to two main back drops the aircraft and the downtown of new york city combat in this movie is of epic proportions you have the entire kick ass fighting styles of a super hero and special forces but without any of the excessive blood splatter that can sometimes just demean an entire movie crowds should flock to this movie for its stellar use of special effects heroism and best of all to see our daring young heroes compete in war,fantasy
 unleashedthe highly anticipated movie from joss whedon the was released in the theater in may 2012 and the dvd release was in september 2012 i could not wait for this movie to finally be released after watching iron man iron man 2 thor and captain america on the big screen i would finally get to see a full team on screen what kind of story would they do and make it work with all these different characters and cast robert downey jr aka tony stark  iron man does a great job with his part his sarcastic one liners are great and humorous chris evans aka steve rogers  captain america does a good job but some moments i felt were kind of flat mark ruffalo aka bruce banner  the hulk steals the movie with his interpretation of his character he reminded me of bill bixbys character he played on the tv version of the incredible hulk there are moments in the movie that will catch you off guard and make you laugh with the hulk the rest of the cast does a great job with their characters and makes the team work well together i would still like to see some of the back stories on some of the characters the movie started slow for me but then gets action packed and is nonstop for the rest of the movie the story line works well has some good underlying messages like loki in germany and wanting everyone to kneel to him wasnt there a leader from germany that wanted everyone to kneel to him how did that work out tony starks realizes that his building is the power source for loki to bring his army through a portal throughout the movie the have to figure out how to coexist and work with each other in the end they get it done and now some like them and some dontthe movie is shot well and put together good i seen the movie in 3d at the theater it was ok but it didnt seem like most of the movie was shot in 3d just most of the action packed parts of the movie i watched at home a couple of times on dvd i liked it just as much the cgi was done good with some good scenes loved the flying battleship overall this was a great movie and would recommend it to everyone joss pulls it off and makes the avenger into a great movie cant wait to see the next one,fantasy
joss whedons the was the most talked about movie since the trailer first aired i was excited to see it and yet i ended up missing it in theaters and sadly had to wait for it to come out on dvd when i finally was able to rent it and put it in i knew right from the start what everyone was talking about this movie has everything that anyone could ever want out of an hero action packed semi comical and slightly sad movie and yet to me there still seemed to be some mysteries that were left to question like any other films that are made to lead up to another it is usually important that one sees the films beforehand so that way they know each characters original story i felt that with the for the people that did see all of the movies thor with chris hemsworth iron man with robert downey jr captain america with chris evans and even the hulk whose character has been played by three different celebrities that the movie did not follow suit with what had happened in the prior movies for instance in the movie thor we last saw him trapped at his home land of asgard unable to come see jane his love who is back on earth yet in the movie the he seems to be able to use his lightning bolt powers to magically come down with no explanation and join the rest of the crew in the future also when he did come down he was not with the yet he should have taken time to see her another thing i did not quit understand this may be the fact that i do not read comics is how the hulk cannot control his anger when he is a raging green monster and he at first fights with anyone that is in a four foot radius but as the final battle scene rolls around he suddenly knows who is the enemy and who is not which also relates back to the fact that when we first meet him in the he has himself hidden away someplace peaceful so he does not get angry and lash out i just think that those might be some minor flaws in the story linehowever all around i think that the is a good movie it has everything that a person could want out of a marvel movie which has been dishing out amazing stories for a long time the choice of actorsactresses for each character and each movie makes up for the little ummso wait how did that happen with their personalities and the way they make it seem as though they have been those characters all their life with all the flair the movie has despite the leaks in the story line i would give this movie an eight out ten,fantasy
the marvel directed by joss whedon has its own take on the many different types of the team that cannot be defeated by any foe for instance the first team which should have been in the movie if going in chronological order features iron man antman the wasp thor and the hulk in the marvel the team consisted of captain america iron man black widow hawkeye the hulk thor and nick fury i say it has its own take because in the episode that the take on the villain loki the 1 there are no aliens the episode with loki is actually how he tricks the hulk to destroy train tracks however with the more action packed society today this story wouldnt have gone over as wellthe new story of marvels might be better than the old but the characters need some work if the history of the characters is taking into consideration the movie is way off base first of all the first avenger captain america is suppose to be a man from brooklyn but he does not have the typical rless speech we hear from new yorkers further on this idea is natasha romanoff black widow is suppose to be a highly trained spy from russia yet she doesnt sound like a russian on a better note though i think that the hulk is by far the best so far and even hoping they try a third time to get it right starring mark ruffalo as the hulk a couple characters i think that marvels depicts very well are thor iron man and of course the hulkanother drawback of marvels is the relationship between hawkeye and black widow in the comics hawkeye and black widow are both in love however hawkeye is clearly more in love as he follows black widow to steal starks technology in the movie they depict black widow as the one following hawkeye around completely switching the roles of their relationship furthermore the relationship between tony stark and pepper potts was brief but spot on pepper potts is the calm one that is realistic behind the irrational volatile tony stark the true proof that opposites attractin conclusion in marvels there may be small setbacks in the characters but it still does not take away from it being a very good movie i would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet but it does help to watch the marvel movies that precede it such as captain america iron man 1 and 2 thor and the incredible hulk the changes that joss whedon has made to the i feel relates to todays society very well as how many teams have changed to adapt to society i will be in line awaiting the 2 in may of 2015 the due date so far,fantasy
the movie is a good movie because of the the marvelous effects and the plot they picked the excellent actors to play the characters the actors robert downey jr iron man chris evens captain america jeremy renner hawk eye mark ruffalo hulk tom hiddleston loki and many more good actors the other reason is a fine movie to watching is the action adventure and the bravery in addition the is a a satisfying movie because the heroes are trying to protect the world from the thors brother loki the movie has frequent scenes with fighting in most of the movie lokis army is trying to invade the world while thor and the rest of the are trying to assure the world safety as the world is being attack and protected at the same time the earths mightiest heroes are fighting and as music is playing it makes feel like you are in an awe while your watching the movie after about five seconds it goes back into all the action that is accruing around the world furthermore the movie has a lot of adventure in the movie the heroes do not like each other very much but have to learned to get along especially iron man and thor the have to learned how to fight with each other and to grantee the world safety it is an adventure because while they are on the verge to fight loki and his army they make hulk mad and he turns into the green monster and he conveniently almost kills blackwidow although there is a abundant of fighting i thought there should have been scenes with close friends and family it would have been better if some of the heroes might have said bye to their families i thought they should have to said they might not make it back to some one they love the movie would be a fantastic movie if they had just a little less action evidently in this movie there is a lot of bravery there is bravery when iron man says we have a hulk telling loki to back down in different words as they are fighting when they get knocked down they just get back up there is even more bravery when loki throws iron man out the window and iron man is brave and waits for his suit to come and save him even though loki is evil he stills stands up to hulk then hulks repeatedly beats lokifinally as the movie ends the meet at street and they all just stand there nick furry tells them they did a good job and if there is another invasion they will avenge it other wise i give an eight because of things they could have done to make the the story better so they would have got people caught up in the sympathy,fantasy
i ve seen a couple of negative reviews about this movie in here people complain that its not unique like the star wars or matrix or similar movies that came out there with very inventive ideas and gave us something new to think about well this movie isnt that and its not supposed to be either anyone who is somewhat familiar with comic book characters do know who these guys are and for so many years we have been craving  to see a good flick where they are brought together with good effects good plot and good action the idea has been out there for decades we dont want anything new from it we just wanted what we already know to be presented in a nice package  and yes they did itthe answers these all maybe not to perfection but far the best so far i had a great time watching this movie i enjoyed the action i enjoyed how vs between heros was incorporated and i loved the great sense of humor i laughed a god damn lot and in the end i was satisfied and yes time after time i went back and saw it again hell yes if a movie makes me do that in my standards its a good one certain things could have been done better of course i am damn sure that every director watching the final product says the same thing but it just costs tons of money to go back and shoot a scene again that is understood just to give a general idea from my side1 loki is too weak and does not really pose a challenge the main threat ends up being hordes of invaders 2 thor launches a leaping blow with his hammer and cappy just blocks it with his shield causing a huge blast of sound waves well thats a bit silly  but in the end he is captain america isnt he 3 thor falling down in the glass cage and seemingly that cage was designed to hurt hulk who happily jumps down that high butt naked anyways well doesnt really add up 4the gigantic flying craft  well too much time spent around it and its not really exciting or convincing at all i hoped that it wasnt used at all5 in the end iron man falling off the sky is quite a bit cliche but hulk saving him saves the moment who ever thought of that bravomaybe bits and pieces more but not worth mentioningis this a great movie  probably no is this a great comic movie hell yes  910 from me keep up the good work ,fantasy
not since superman with christopher reeve has their been a film that captures the true essence of a comic booka lot of super hero films are just by the number dumb boring cgi fest green lantern for example was a real victim of this kind of mindless stupidity in making a super hero filmwhen puts all his hard earned experience of years in tv with buffy here  he understands how characters work and understands an intelligent plot linemy only quibble would be the aping of th transformers movie with the building being destroyed in the end but apart from that this is probably one of the best super heroes ver madewell done mr whedon,fantasy
it is true that every movie has its own particular genre and the is of the actionscific genre but a good flick is such that regardless the genre possesses features like good trainy storyline conceived out of the script emotional content even if its a little bit of suspense intrigue or unpredictability realness excluding the visualspecial effects which is not real but cool and allowedi had such high expectations for marvels the but i was disappointed the storyline is very weak the other the tesseract has awakened it is on a little world a human world they would wield its power but our ally knows its workings as they never will  how did the tesseract come about from where and how did it come to manifest on earth and how come the asgardians from a distance light yearsplanet speaking english i could predict this movie from scene to scene till the end its like watching one crankedup episode of superman cartoonthis movie is a 143min of explicit action and special effect which i so love but all these without the afore mentioned points is like eating jam without breadnevertheless this is my opinion and you are so rightfully entitled to yours nice day yall ,fantasy
for me surely ant man giant manwaspblack panther and war machine will be in the 2 as marvel studios has announced that this will be a movie for ant man in 2015 and for sure wasp his wife will be in also announced that will be black panther movie in 2014 and war machine certainly will be in the 2 after iron man 3 specially that he ought to be in the as he appeared at some posters about wolverine i think it is impossible to appear in the 2 specially after marvel sold him to another company as for spider man and doctor strange i think its difficult but not impossible to be in the 2 marvel sold them to disney and it is possible to make agreement between marvel and disney but i think that doctor strange is more possible to be in the than spider man,fantasy
i never thought going into the cinema that the previous marvel films would amount to so much they are nothing in comparison to this masterpiece the films leading up to this being captain america thor the incredible hulk and the iron man films these films range from average to decent decent being iron man 1 which is the best out of the prequels this film works in so many ways its hard to know where to begin with the review the acting is good the story line isnt complex but not too simple either each character is given a good amount of screen time and no character is left underpowered or look insignificant the effects are very good maybe some of the best ever so far in film making josh whedon has done himself proud i loved firefly and now i love thisoverall a very very very good film it is incomparable to the dark knight or the other batman films as it is a completely different type of film i do love those films as well it just works,fantasy
first of all i would like to say that the is marvels best film to date and there are quite a few positives in the filmthe direction and screenplay is nothing short of brilliant joss whedon deserves a lot of credit the film could have gone awfully wrong with so much heroes in one film but the director has successfully tightened up all loose ends for a film in which so much characters are sharing one screen space you would expect a lot of things to go wrong but not in this onethe acting was nothing short of brilliant all the characters were completely faithful to their roles but the standout was mark ruffalo as the hulk he was nothing short of amazing i wont be surprised if marvel makes a stand alone hulk film with himthe special effects were outstanding i have never seen anything like it in any film beforenow to the negatives about the film one of them is the soundtrack that doesnt quite live upto expectationsthe other is the dialogue as far as i can think there were no memorable dialogues at all all were pretty mediocrethe main negative thing about the film was the lack of emotional depth which was in abundance in spiderman 2 and nolans batman trilogyoverall i would say it is a brilliant film but a little overrated i dont think it should be more than 8 on imdb 86 is too much and very close to tdk and tdkr which were pure masterpieces however it is marvels best film upto date and certainly raises the bar for marvel at the movies,fantasy
the culmination of marvels fouryear fivepicture master plan is puzzlingly both as good as id hoped and a mild disappointment it excels at playing up the largerthanlife aspects of the story from the testy initial relationship between heroes and the looming magnitude of the threat theyre called together to face such moments are dispersed liberally perhaps once every five minutes and theyre an effective method of keeping the audience on the hook for the duration whats missing at least from where i sit is a measure of substance or depth behind those fireworks robert downey jr is again excellent in his nuanced interpretation of the paradoxical tony stark and mark ruffalo might just be the best hulk to grace the silver screen but by comparison the rest of the cast feels quite thin shallow and for lack of a better word cartoonish captain america for example wears a completely different personality than he did in his solo picture and never feels quite right as the commanding field general hes presented to be the most intriguing aspect of his character an emotional detachment from modern culture is barely even mentioned he and the rest of the team feels like a suit of armor with a few good oneliners not a living breathing human being its a trap that was mostly evaded in the stars preceding solo shots so its a shame to see it tripped here especially given the amount of time and effort that was expended to define each individuals motivations those nitpicks certainly arent enough to stop me from enjoying the closest thing well ever get to an allsplashpage crossover megaevent on the big screen but theyre also irritating enough to keep tickling the back of my mind while the next set of fuses are lit its a herculean effort with some truly great rewards but not the pictureperfect ensemble masterpiece it would have you believe,fantasy
ill start by saying that when i bought tickets to this show i was a little sceptic first because i did not imagine how can you build a story involving hulk and thor were is tony starks arrogance and attention going to fit and finally will it all be just a bunch of no sense fights but as the action went on all my fears were shattered tony was still arrogant but funny in the same way i loved the nagging between hulk and thor captain america was exactly how it was in his own movie a true believer a true american the story was not that good but i did not see huge plot holes lake ive seen on battleship for example and the small comedy involved between the fighting scenes made this movie even greater,fantasy
if you are a hardcore fan and read the comic books as i do read all the and civil war storyline it will be a major disappointment for you because of the plot another thing that disappointed me is that the movie is in my opinion a total copy of transformers dark of the moon at least how it is performed half of the movie from the start to the mid they are just talking about what they have to do and loki plays with their mind no action till the midmovie just like transformers although that after the midmovie i must say it was pretty entertaining but if you knew that c america beats the sht out of ironman in the books just like thor and both of them without trouble it will again break it to you since he is like the most overpowered guy in there after the hulk also america is not stupid in the books,fantasy
in keeping with marvels best efforts joss whedon sets this movie apart from every other standard adventure movie by the way he communicates the overall experience we live the story and we feel the intensity and gravity of every situation we fully embrace the characters as we go along on this amazing ride its so wonderful that we got to know each of the major players in their own solo movies before this adventure that just adds a ton to the depth this movie isnt about comic book pulp or things that go boom but about a powerful exciting and meaningful story the elements are fantastical but perfectly balanced by the characters and the way whedon grounds everythingvisual and emotional imagery are presented throughout the movie and provides the viewer with greater insight into the heroes and even the villain everything here screams quality and screams fun all the way through yes despite the depth and serious consequences there is a great deal of fun thats something im so grateful that marvel usually delivers for those going into this flick expecting a lot of fun prepare to enjoy but remember fun is not the only piece of this pie in fact i think most movie fans will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers uponthis is a smart and surprisingly deep film that really delivers on everything promised in all those teaser setups from other marvel films,fantasy
in a nutshell the are six superheroes brought together by an organisation called shield to protect the earth the a product of the marvel comic book publishing company are black widow the hulk captain america thor hawkeye and iron man four of these have already had movies made about them as part of the same franchise and this movie draws heavily on that out of the four earlier movies involving these superheroes i enjoyed thor and the hulk i was not particularly bowled over by the iron man and captain america movies i have to admit a bias as a childhood dc fan i was never able to get into marvel comics also im not into video games at allas you might expect this movie was a parade of spectacular effects superhero stunts fearsome aliens wild technology city obliterating fights shootouts chases and so on when i say spectacular special effects i am not kidding its astonishing what filmmakers are able to show on screen nowadaysthere was also a good deal of superhero clichs of the good kind jingoism both noble and sappy comedy snappy oneliners oiled biceps and tight leotards speaking of the latter two chris hemsworth makes a great thorchris evanswell lets just say i dont quite get captain america as much as i get chris evans i prefer him as the wisecracking torch mark ruffalo was ok as bruce banner but the script didnt really give him a chance to do his stuff this movie was mostly about iron man but im not into this superhero i really dont get iron man such a waste of a good actorin general this movie seemed a little forced to me there were parts of it that i was unable or unwilling to follow closely the film had a very fast pace perhaps too much action it was clearly designed to be primarily an adrenalininducing visual experience the problem is that i dont go to movies to get an adrenalin rush i go to be entertained an emotional and intellectual process not a physical onei also have to confess that this movie seems quite similar to other action films ive seen lately its getting hard to tell them apart scary aliens awesome technology skyscraper carnage endangered earth this genre seems to have the same four themes popping up over and over again i suppose ive become jaded but maybe its time for something different now that we can show virtually anything on film its time to move to other things dont you think i yearn for the nearreligious awe and excitement i felt when i saw close encounter of the third kind for the first time many years ago is the kind of movie that doesnt deliver that to me this movie evoked no emotion in me at all really i didnt feel anything for the characters in this film i didnt really care what happened to any of them i felt mostly annoyance at the nyc destruction scenes the highlight of the film for me involved the amusing final scene with hulk and loki but thats all im going to sayits an entertaining film no different than the others really you might as well see it everyone else has the score assigned to this movie on imdb is far too high and casts a shadow over the entire imdb ratings concept,fantasy
marvel presents a super hero team ans its called the the super heroes are iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow thor has a brother loki he was the enemy of course with his super army of another world a good movie with good actors and music the effects brilliant and very interesting good jokes especially from iron man the actors more featured were robert downy as iron man chris evans as captain america mark ruffalo as hulk chris helmsworth as thor scarlet johansson as black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye tom hidleston as loki and clark gregg as agent phil colson you should see the movie at the theater because it is a really good moviesee it by pepper leguin santiago chile,fantasy
the main plot starts within the first five minutes to ten minutes when loki infiltrates the shield base and causes its destruction leading up to the creation of thethe is a great superhero flick the chemistry between the actors is great and all the superheroes deliver especially the hulk mark ruffalo gave the best performance of any hulk on the big screen robert downey jr isnt as witty and charismatic as in iron man but that is expected due to him having to share the spotlight tom hiddlestons portrayal of loki is one to be praised the misunderstood god in thor becomes much more menacing and this time he knows exactly what he wants his performance is reminiscent of heath ledgers in his oscar winning performance of the joker overall the is a fun superhero film i is not oscar worthy but it a great popcorn flick,fantasy
iron man robert downey jr the incredible hulk mark ruffalo hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarlett johansson thor chris hemsworth and captain america chris evans make the this film is pretty sweet the assemble to face off against the god of mischief himself loki portrayed by tom hiddleston what does the have awesome visual effects great characters great direction not the best plot i cant think of any other villains that they could have fought against well villains of these superheroes magneto or a batman villain could have worked but of course that goes out of their section of villains i just wasnt feeling the alien invasion thing though the action was incredible  and it prevented the viewer from becoming bored the gags were really funny iron man and the incredible hulk added charisma to the film the film casts a big box office shadow for upcoming super hero films like the amazing spiderman and the dark knight rises so hopefully those dont disappointmy expectations were high from hearing all of the awesome things about it so i didnt enjoy it as much as i wanted to granted the film is still better than ones average super hero film and was still enjoyable verdict 84100,fantasy
this is what we go to the movies for for edge of the seat action intriguing plot and to have a good laugh from time to time has it all story wise it actually picks up mostly from thor ended but be make sure that you have watched captain america to catch some of the jokes and iron man 1 and 2 just to keep up with tony stark is a very intelligently made piece of work that manages to satiate almost everything that a superhero movie fan craves for very well timed humour from the entire castespecially from iron man of course is actually its biggest strength when this project was announced i could not even begin to imagine how the makers would manage to make enough room for so many heavyweights on one canvas but they do it incredibly well and how watch it if you already haventrepeat viewing may be forced and then also buy yourself a copy when it is released on dvd thats what i am going to do ,fantasy
why the could easily become a huge success i think even some of you could answer thiz question thiz movie is the culmination of marvels hard work over the past couple of years the lucky guy who was appointed to direct thiz movie is joss whedon the director of shield nick fury samuel l jackson initiates the initiative by assembling all the super humans to save the world from the powerful evil loki tom hiddleston the storyline isnt as dynamic as i think it is theres a time when the story is stuck and filled with unnecessary dialogue the power of thiz movie obviously lies in its character interactions nick fury is originally written as a white guy in the comic book but samuel l jackson confidently steps in to play thiz character thiz isnt the first time thiz has happened it reminds me when michael clarke duncan portrayed the overweight crime boss kingpin in ben afflecks daredevil 2003 and im also so excited to see laurence fishburne as clark kents boss perry white in upcoming supermans man of steel 2013 however in thiz case i didnt see samuel l jackson became nick fury instead it was nick fury became samuel l jackson but in the end its totally acceptable samuel l jackson is able to present a precise leadership aura to his nick furys character once again i have to remind you what made thiz movie so interesting is when these superheroes gather around and interact with each other we can see the duo chris chris evans and chris hemsworth who successfully demonstrate their muscular bodies just like in captain america the first avenger 2011 and thor 2011 thiz is how superheroes should look like the brand new figures in thiz movie are the master archer hawkeye jeremy renner and the elegant agent maria hill cobie smulders who is widely known in how i met your mother 2005present the other figures who have been introduced since iron man 2 are the loyal agent phil coulson clark gregg and the sexy heroine black widow scarlett johansson surprisingly scarlett johansson has a fairly large part in thiz movie wait a minute on second thought if you have scar jo in tight sexy latex suit of course you will exploit it more if were talking about iron man thiz is also one of the most interesting parts it looks like robert downey jr have already fused into thiz tony starks character so deep he can represent thiz selfcentered character very well without any problem but in thiz movie the one who really becomes a scene stealer is the giant green rage monster named hulk once again its the hulks character not exactly dr bruce banner or mark ruffalo but its all of them in one some fresh and funny moments are obviously when hulk is around the most unfortunate thing is that they didnt bring up the original founding team such as antman and the wasp into the movie in the end i confidently can say marvel comics seems to be one step ahead from its competitor dc comics so far recently thiz movie has ruled the box office chart and it turns out to be the earths mightiest blockbuster movie you know what that means right oh yeah the next movie will be coming soon maybe next time marvel studios will enrich their universe with the presence of other superheroes like quicksilver black panther vision doctor strange shehulk wolverine even spiderman are you ready for another onevisit my blog on jonnys movee httpjonnyfendiblogspotcom,fantasy
ok as a child i grew up reading comics every weekend i would go to the book store where they sold these comics i loved marvel they had the best heroes ever but the was always my one favorites series hulk iron man and captain america as earths mightiest heroes in one comic together was a big deal i always knew they would make this movie but i didnt know it would be such an epic filmif you watched previous marvel movies ironman 1  2 the incredible hulk thor captain america the first avenger you eagerly anticipated that these bigger than life characters would grace the screen and they finally didwell heres a summary for the film loki has returned to earth to rule it but he needs to get the out of his long hair at first the dont really get along they fight and bicker amongst themselves which is exactly what loki wants but once loki opens up another dimension to destroy earth the assemble in an epic battlenow everyone gave great performances but mark ruffalo as bruce banner stole the show much like his other side the hulk did the battles were great the humor was pretty funny robert downey jr as tony stark was once again a high point in the film i dont like how fans of joss act like he is some sort of demigod but i have to give the man some credit for this film he really outdid himself but once the movie is over you have to grasp or pinch yourself because its that epic,fantasy
this is truly a fantastic film the acting is great and nearly every scene was truly spectacular there are not many settings in the movie which is what ive always wanted in a movie and the movie really focuses on the plot there were no additional useless scenes which makes you think of how much of a tremendous work was put into this film i dont really think theres really anything else to say about this movie if you havent seen this movie yet you better go see it its truly marvelous its not a disappointment it is a movie worth money fabulous job marvel and disney i hope the sequel will be as great as this one,fantasy
theres something unique about this movie it speeds through a complex back story many back stories actually and yet makes it work through excellent dialog and even more incredible and often subtle acting it adds more action than a michael bay film but does it right by investing the audience beforehand not to mention how much better the actual action is it assembles characters with very uneven powers but manages to make them all shinebasically its excellent everythings good in it but ill just state the reasons you should see it the dialog and character interaction is amazing the fight choreography is unrivaled the comedy is just as incredible as the action and they often intersect beautifully the cast is excellent the villain makes the world conquering routine seem fresh which is not easy to do the stakes are high but at the same time its a personal battle each of the characters has a different reason for being there and the movie gives them all importance which is one of the most difficult things about ensembles like this there are even more subtle story arcs that expand the viewers interest in the heroes personalities given them depth while foreshadowing directions for future films in this franchisethere are a lot of things this movie had to overcome that it did beautifully for one thing it was the first movie that i know of that attempted to build off of other standalone films it connects them quite well then it had to survive the editing room apparently over an hour of footage was left out most probably at the request of the studio the pacing is still great it had to live up to fans expectations dont know about other fans but ive been collecting comics since i was 8 and this movie blew my mind joss whedons greatest achievement had to be to introduce these characters to each other create group tensions and then quickly have them learn to work together if you pay attention you can see them learn each others rhythms and adapt to each others styles slowly as the movie progressesi especially enjoyed mark ruffalo i was skeptical about this casting choice even though i really liked him in shutter island i have to say he plays the hulk much more enjoyably than any previous incarnation while others have always portrayed him in a more clichd jeckyl and hyde style he plays him with his own technique he attempts the character of bruce banner like a person whos learnt to overcome a crippling addictionflaw similar to what a lot of recovering rageaholics real thing go through but the world and loki seem to be begging him to release the other guy you truly feel for once that the hulk and bruce banner are the same person but in very different states of mind which is how its supposed to be he also has a sense of humour about his condition making him more likable than the usual whiny bruce banners his hulk is just the most amazing character when the big fight scene happens he does not disappointthe cinema experience is great the movie is 2 and a half hours long but just flies bywhat i personally most enjoyed about the movie is that it wasnt shy about being a comic book movie in fact it celebrated the comic book over the top attitude with everyone and not just fans there was no humor in this that was an in joke that only fans would get it pokes fun and shows flaws in its heroes it makes the hero villain struggle very enjoyablebasically this is the movie ive wanted since i was a kid its big and its smart but also didnt have to go to dark and gritty story lines like a lot of other comic book movies which often feels out of place and humourless to mea definite mustsee,fantasy
its about time another movie without senseless violence it has a moral some will claim its sappy or clich but i was so in need of a action movie with a moral and a positive theme i could have done with a little less violence so kids could go just a little to much but thankfully not graphic all in all i loved it i am also really hoping to see more like it especially anything not a zombie movie i dont always agree with marvel comics or stan lee but on this one i have to give a thumbs up now if we can just get some other genres with a plot and good acting thanks marvel oh almost forgot thanks for letting captain america be captain america,fantasy
i cant help but be a little reminded of sergio aragones take on marvel comics where all the marvel characters had gotten together to face off against the seagoing soarer only to be reminded that whenever marvel comic characters assemble in large numbers they must always fight amongst themselves regardless of the reason or the consequencesits the same with most buddy cop movies such introductory films require a little adversarial tension in order for headstrong individualistic alphas to come together and overcome the foe that is bigger than either could handle alone lethal weapon 48 hours tango and cash the last boyscout red heat etcetera etceterathis is the same basic formula that the follows its a buddy cop film with more explosions and the hulk the animosity here however tends to come from the machinations of loki and the general distrust of working with a secret organization albeit one with our best interests in mindthe characters are not two dimensional caricatures each with their own emotional weaknesses and psychological strengths the development is meager but adequate for an action film one moment of blatant chekovs gun exists where a characters devotion is called into question and then takes on a suicide mission at the end of the final battle im not quite willing to call it lazy writing at this point but it is painfully reminiscent of the youre a valued part of the team too episodes that every 80s cartoon series had multiple viewings may be needed to come to a final verdict on that minor and relatively unneeded subplotthe only other minor gripe i had with the film is that there was very few scenes where the heroes worked together in a fight a couple more well choreographed fight scenes involving multiple heroes would have been welcome but its nothing more than a minor inconveniencethe earths mightiest buddy cop film,fantasy
guess ill come out and say it right away the may be the best superhero movie made to date it has plenty of action an understandable plot multiple and discernible heroes plenty of laughs and terrific effects now ill admit it everyone else seems to be saying the same thing so do i need to maintain my integrity as an amateur reviewer person by going against the grain and finding fault with the movie or can i feel secure in my own opinion even if its shared by fanboys and nonfans alike hint its the latter who are the anyway well theres captain america steve rogers whos actually from the 1940s but was frozen for about seventy years theres iron man tony stark a man in a weaponized metal suit theres the hulk bruce banner who smashes theres black widow natasha romanoff a superspy with some powers of her own theres hawkeye clint barton a master archer and then theres thor a norse god weve been introduced to most of them already through their own films so they seem like old pals to us helps cut down on backstory issues anywayit seems that loki the halfbrother of thor has decided to open up a portal from his side of the universe to earth itself thus allowing a rampaging army of aliens to come in and slaughter us wholesale colonel nick fury whos been recruiting our heroes to fight as a team calls everyone in from wherever they were they dont know each other except by reputation can they stop bickering long enough to save the universe it is possiblei mentioned before that our heroes are well discernible this is no small feat considering how many there are in the movie tony stark is a narcissist steve rogers is an anachronism bruce banner has anger management issues natasha is manipulative barton is manipulated theyre simultaneously human and superhumanafter assembling his team fury gives them the skinny banners job is to find the tesseracs location an artifact that can produce immense power  or be wielded as an immense weapon supposedly the tesserac is high in gamma radiation something dr banner knows a little bit about meanwhile the others are tasked with finding loki whos quite the badass all of this is directed by fury from a flying fortress that also can float kind of neatwithout the burden of needing backstories for everyone writerdirector joss whedon is free to throw thrills at us the fight scenes are plausible and at times not at all cartoonish this means that younger kids its a pg13 movie might find it a little intense but theres very little blood and whats seen is more like scratches on a face or something at any rate although its an unapologetically violent movie its carefully done the amazing set pieces dont get in the way of a compelling story fraught with plenty of angst and anguish this is how transformers should have beenboy is there conflict its not as if the superheroes all show up mentally on board with furys plan not only are some of them mad at him they snipe a little at each other sometimes this is the work of the masterful loki sometimes its the natural difficult of strangers needing to form a cohesive unitthe acting is superb nick fury is a role for which the estimable samuel l jackson was born to play and which hes played as a cameo in several movies already scarlett johanssen picks up where she left off as black widow in iron man and robert downey jr to no ones surprise is effortlessly suave and jerkish as stark chris evans as the idealistic captain and chris hemsworth as the mighty but humbled thor are both terrific as well mark ruffalo makes for a quietly intense banner and portrayed the hulk via special effects jeremy renner seen very briefly in the thor movie is hawkeye a character with which most of us had had no prior exposure renner however gives his character so much depth that were involved in his side story even more than we are with the othersso why wouldnt you watch this movie it does have a lot of action so if you hate that you should skip it its over two hours long so if you dont like to sit you should also skip it it has strong female characters hissable villains heroes of all sizes complicated love stories that sit in the background and the fate of all mankind resting in the balance wait i was supposed to be giving reasons not to watch it too bad ive run out,fantasy
starting in the summer of 2008 with the first iron man film and wrapping up with captain america last july marvel finally brings the initiative full circle in high fashion the finally arrives receiving mad critical raves and smashing box office records specifically grossing 207 million dollars opening weekend more than any movie in history and all for good reason the is straight up one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies ever made its the raiders of the lost ark of superhero moviesheres the gist of the plot exiled god of asgard loki returns to earth and attacks the base of shield strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division to retrieve the powerful tesseract and unleash his vengeance with an army of creatures known as the chitauri to fight this new threat shield director nick fury decides to call in the help of sarcastic billionaire tony stark iron man superstrong patriot steve rogers captain america ill tempered scientist bruce banner hulk asgardian thunder god thor russian double agent natasha romanov black widow and expert marksman clint barton hawkeye six heroes for the price of one with an awesome cast and action sequences that would make even spielberg jealous all directed by fanboy extraordinaire joss whedon i want a sequel now the achievement that the represents is simply unprecedented all of the previous singularly released movies were wonderful in how they took their time and delivered consistent quality iron man thor and captain america were all wonderful breaths of fresh air that delivered the laughs and the thrills iron man 2 and the incredible hulk may have been slight weak links but still remained enjoyable to have the bring this idea all together so seamlessly is terrific but it also makes just as good a separate achievement a heartfelt hilarious and exciting ride to beholdwith such a big cast of characters the fact that they all feel satisfyingly developed is something of a miracle not everything is always perfect but as both a writer and director joss whedon is spot on with how he treats these characters he gives them all their equal share in the spotlight and literally no one stands out amongst the others robert downey jr is delightfully deadpan and sarcastic as stark chris evans continues to play a very likable character with rogers chris hemsworths thor is just as fun and hammy as ever scarlett johansson and jeremy renner are aces as black widow and hawkeye and tom hiddleston brings a fantastic villain out of loki as for mark ruffalo replacing edward norton his calm and cool personality as bruce banner is the perfect opposite for his split personality and the green muscle man is so awesome  and hilarious  when he finally takes the stage hulk smash and we love him for it this isnt even mentioning the bravura action sequences whedon is smart to not overwhelm the audience with braindead action without first giving an honest emotional investment and throughout most of the movie hes smart in how he spreads them out when the movies epic 30 minute climax begins thats when whedon finally lets it all loose in genuinely gleefully exciting fashion complete with stellar visual effects and awesome sound design also this is a really long movie nearly two and a half hours but it doesnt even feel that long i honestly felt like i could have watched it for even longer maybe even all day the original cut of this movie was apparently three hours in length and i would have loved to see that version just because the whole thing just flies by so smoothlywith such a great kick off to the summer movie season we can only hope that everything else will be at least half as fun the is the ultimate in hollywood nerdvana and i cant wait to see it again12 ,fantasy
funny enough the was to over hyped in the uk i feel not like those ridiculous movies like avatar or as i like to call it pocahontasor titanic 3d i still cannot understand why go and buy the vhs its the same bloody movie the was witty and hilarious i confess my motives for watching it were completely perverse i went to drool over chris evans and robert downey jr which i did but the humour it was i remember most to top things off there was stuff blowing up comedy sex appeal and action i would definitely recommend going to see it to all those that havent gone yet seriously dude you are like a very small minority at the minute go and watch it,fantasy
the movie is vastly entertaining the action scenes are amazing and satisfying nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences i felt as if there was not a single bad performance each of the characters brought their personality from their respective movie to the table marc ruffalobrilliant and a welcome addition and so much better than the last hulk  edward norton when mark ruffalo was first announced to play bruce banner i didnt know what to think of it i knew that hes a good actor all he needs is the right director to get the needed onscreen character out of him i really hope they make an incredible hulk movie sequel starring mark ruffalo as dr bruce bannerjoss whedon did one hell of a job directing and writing this original script the end title sequence is like 20000 names long wow amazing to think how he was able to juggle that and pull this film off highly recommend,fantasy
superhero movies now thats a name that brings to mind images of clich filled action sequences noninteresting and noninvolving storyline and either ridiculously badass or plain dumb actoractress performances thats what most superhero movies has been as of recently with a few exceptions now why should this movie be any different i mean this time its not only one hero but six i think at least so why in hll should this be anything else but goodlooking yet pointless action times 6 that was a thought that flew through my head yet so many had said and written so much good about this movie that i still had to see it so i phoned a friend we booked tickets and today we went to watch this couldbe goodbutprobablynotsoverygood movie i had expectations of course and they were met all right with loads to cover them like 10 times or something because needless to say really i was wrong horribly wrongthis movie has all this wouldbe eyecandy action that can make a movie look awesome but thats about it but this movie had so much more it had dept it had personality and it had a sound and believable identity and most of all it had a story not the best one in history but more than good enough to keep you glued to the seat for the major part of the movie the action packed scenes and stunning visuals did the rest of that jobso now ive given you my story of this encounter with a turnpoint in my life and it really have been i went in somewhat excited yet skeptical and came out a believer because that certainly is the case i have had renewed faith in superhero movies because this movie the has shown me that this genre still have the ability to deliver nowim not saying that this will automatically become the best movie of the year overall but it will definitely be a worthy candidate,fantasy
so here we are now after years of development and a few film establishing the main characters we get to see a team of superheroes being well a superhero super group my initial response was of dread as i could not see it working well but to my surprise it is one of the most entertaining films of the yearwith earth being under attack from dastardly villain loki and his evil plot to rule earth and its inhabitants it is down to nick fury samuel l jackson to pull together his group of superheroes to save the human race luckily for those of you who have seen all the individual films the need for each characters origin and development is unnecessary as they have been fully established in their own storiesthe film does start off very well and establishes a plot although very well worn about an attempt by loki main villain from thor to take a mysterious cube the tesseract which harnesses a power that can open a teleportwormhole to allow an alien army which he commands to take over the world even with this simplistic and over familiar storyline the film has many entertaining moments and is littered with loads of whedons trademark witty one linersthe one truly great thing about this film is how well it manages all the superheroes characters and never does one character feel like its just a film about them with a few extra superheroes tagging along each one of them have a similar amount of screen time and a specific purpose which drives the plot forward another thing is that the guy behind the film whedon knows his material and creates a loving authentic and workable story which means each character never feels like a bit character a very balanced juggling act which allows the stars to shine and show their unique personalitiesthe only minor criticism i would give is the over hype that this picture has garnered by many and judging by its box office record breaking takings people are going in their droves to see what all the fuss is about dont get me wrong the film is good but not an all time classic the plot is nothing new and the alien invasion at the climax of the film is a bit reminiscent of transformers 3 and a team that doesnt get on but eventually stand together and realize a common enemy all very clichd,fantasy
this was simply the best movie i have ever witnessed i didnt really like super hero movies until i saw the but i came out of the theater screaming because of how awesome it was i wanted to tell the world how great it is and still do and this is the best way for every epic moment there is something hilarious to follow it up i came out with the thought that every one of the super heroes was a total bada and samuel l jackson is awesome too he gets s done i read some of the bad reviews and most say that there is no real emotion but if you actually pay attention you can see small things that make sense and relate to history and stuff i just lost my train of thought good day sir go see this movie,fantasy
on hearing the news and only that joss whedon would undertake the risky venture of five super heroes collection each diva and in his own franchise except the hawkeyes jeremy renner in an allforall cinematic achievement i knew immediately like millions of other marvel geeks that his heart was in place and the balance in the universe would be restored now  nobody knows how to handle the geek material better than the actual archgeek who inspired the toy story and gave the world the buffy and he knows not to disappoint his audience the succeeds where they failed individual films of heroes that includes with the exception of iron man thor and the captain america incredible hulk and othersthe thor with ego the size of the galaxy against all mortals the captain america of the innocent patriotism of 40s to fall victim autocratic cynicism of tony stark and all trembling with the green monstrous alter ego of bruce bannerthe is the dream of the average comic buff come true a perfect fantasy adventure with a record in kind humor and action levels you expect  and much more 1010,fantasy
i wont put any spoilers in my review but i loved this movie surprisingly for a person who doesnt really care for action movies i thought the was one of my all time favorite movies it has humor but not too much and enough awesome action to live up to the enormous hype surrounding it ive notices that sometimes high budget comic book movies have good cgi but bad acting or vise versa not the case with this movie all the characters were amazing even most of the supporting cast which doesnt usually happen in a movie like this i was sad when it ended do i recommend it yes go see it if you havent already i guarantee its worth it i didnt see it in 3d so i cant say how good the 3d is,fantasy
first of all the cast is that not alone to get you to the theater in the next 10 minutes to see itif its not then how about all the records it has brokenstill not enough how about one amazing thrill ride of a movie with lots of action and comedy as well as a great storyline to go with it the seriously has it all the characters all jump back into action except this time they are assembling their powers to form a team that cannot be beat the movie takes a little time to refresh you on any character development you may have forgotten and then it jumps right into the team building experience it takes a while for these superheros to learn how to use their powers together to help one another but once they learn how they are a force to be reckoned with once the action scenes start it doesnt slow down and you have yourself a good hour or more of solid action of buildings blowing up the hulk smashing everything and so much morecalling a movie the best movie ever is almost used too much that the saying loses credibility but trust me on this the seriously is the best movie yet that is until dark knight rises comes out then it may have some competition for that title check out our other reviews at httpwwwreeltimereviewcom,fantasy
in the 1960s marvel comics pioneered mature story lines for its super heroes of whom many have been successfully adapted into blockbuster films spiderman the were a group with individual icons like iron man who had already established identities contrary to the fantastic four and x men marvel began to feature stand alone films that methodically built this core of characters and several years later it has culminated in the a thoroughly entertaining adventure that never fails to engage and marvel its intended audience as orchestrated by versatile writerdirector and comic book fan joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer the results set a high standard in filmic super heroics its nirvana a comic lovers dream come truethe tesseract is a cube with unknown powers and coveted by the fiendish loki thors half brother kept for study by shield the elite security agency and once possessed by the red skull in captain america the first avenger the cube can open a doorway to another dimension when loki steals the cube to unleash a demon army and conquer the earth the shield agents are no match for his supernatural powers what to do who ya gonna call well theres nothing like puttin the band together for the first time assembled by shield director nick fury samuel jackson and aided by agent coulson clark gregg the initiative sought to collect special operatives in the event of an insurmountable threat that was beyond human response these comprise of six extraordinary individuals an otherworldly warrior thor chris hemsworth a genetically enhanced superhuman from the past steve rogers aka captain america chris evans a meek scientist dr bruce banner mark ruffalo and his anger induced gamma radiated monster the hulk inventor tony stark in super armor as iron man robert downey jr and two shield agents master archer hawkeye clint barton jeremy renner and top assassin black widow natasha romanoff scarlett johansson when lokis legion of soldiers descend on manhattan its assemble time drawn by remarkable circumstances and led by captain america its teamwork at its finest as the battle these nasty hordes to save the earth after initially bickering and fighting each other it is fascinating to witness such disparate personalities coalesce into a fighting unit as they flow from self to selflessness this film can stand on its own for newbies not familiar with the previous films but it certainly does not hurt to have seen captain america the first avenger thor iron man and the incredible hulk whedon and company neatly tie the threads of those films together with sufficient focus given to each heros personal life we learn some interesting background on romanoff and barton who you think would be outmatched by their superhuman colleagues but they more than hold their own and figure prominently in the explosive climax rogers the honorable idyllic soldier has to adjust to a world like a modern day rip van winkle dr banner keeps his anger at bay but what will that mean for the if it cant be controlled whedon also cleverly includes familiar supporting characters eg starks assistant pepper gwyneth paltrow from other the filmsall the stars perform ably including tom hiddleston who is appropriately devious as loki downey who clearly improvised much of his dialogue has a rousing good time jackson embodies fury as the manipulative leader who does whatever it takes to safeguard humanitythis is the third movie version of the hulk and while ruffalo does a very good job as the sensitive and haunted banner his alter ego beast actually behaves so unpredictably that some of his actions become comedic and the results are a riot to say more would spoil some hilarious moments the filmmakers got this hulk right a couple things dont quite add up like how does the hulk decide to be a dogooder at a critical moment who is the mysterious council resembling the syndicate from the x files that shield answers to and what are their intentions there are however nice touches like the stark building in the finale and what is left of its logo as an obvious tribute to the when the grand showdown is imminent there is a marvelous circular shot of the that is iconic when the evil army attacks one is reminded of ghostbusters and the apocalyptic scenes of superman ii and any transformers film whedon though never forgets to include intimate moments and details although each avenger gets a heroic moment to shine the film never loses sight of personal loss amid the spectacle the film is also about self sacrifice and people do perish in this film including a major character despite a 143 minute running time the film is full of subplots and wellpaced action and every bit of the enormous effects laden budget is on the big screen the is perhaps not the best super hero film ever made the dark knight being the apex but it is the most complete entertaining multihero film to date the question now is what do you do for an encore and how can anyone hope to top let alone match this achievement it would require the abilities of a james cameron or peter jackson or maybe studio executives can plead for whedons return lets hope so do stay for the end credits for a double dose treat,fantasy
you cant argue with that ok so its sounds pretty hard to mess up this kind of film with the budget and history behind it but hollywood has messed up these films many times before  hulk twiceso would this be any different yes it is different more so than youd thinkfirstly the action scenes are some of the best action scenes ive seen the transformer battle sequences are truly pathetic in comparisonthen theres the comedy and i defy anyone not to laugh out loud while watching this film at least 3 times the hulk steals the show here his scene with loki one of the funniest moment of the filmjust everything worked with this film and one id gladly watch a few times over theres finally a big budget film that actually delivers so as i said well done joss whedon,fantasy
this movie is in my opinion one of the best ever made there were doubts that marvel studios could pulls this movie together the sheer scope was mindboggling with 3 actors  and 4 characters who each carried their own movies it didnt seem likely but the ensemble cast was amazing and each character is given their due focus the story is excellent the villain is likable and suitably evil and the action and special effects are top notch what may surprise many is the fact that amongst all of this spectacle there is heart and humorcomic book fans will enjoy being able to see their favorites o the big screen together and for those nonnerds out there youll find an excellent afternoons entertainment,fantasy
i went to see the movie on the third day of its release after the whole internet was buzzing about it well i submitting to the buzz the movie isnt simply good its awesome with the unpredictable plot i could only guess that at the will win in the end the actors played their part realistically and the special effects only added fuel to the scene i absolutely love how characters that have had their own debut have been put together to cooperate on something more epic then what they have brought as solo the movie features characters from iron manthorthe hulkblack widowcaptain america the first avengerand a marvel comics character hawkeye the are summoned up by a secret agency called shield dealing with highly dangerous villains the team is needed when a cube which contains unlimited power entitled the tesseract is stollen from shields secret base the one that stole the tesseract is a particular norse god of mischief featured in thor names loki as it occurs loki has come to earth to take over and control the planet and the tesseract is needed to open a portal that would invite his army to the party i have seen thor and my impression on the movie wasnt as positive i found it rather boring and unrealistic in terms of special effects and costumes as well as back in thor the characters seemed plain and bordering lacking of any kind of interest in them unlike in the loki returns twice as evil finally resembling the mischief that he is the god of he seems to know exactly what he wants and lives of pathetic mortals as he calls humans does not bother him in fact there are moments in the movie where the actor demonstrates the character so perfectly that it is a sealed impression of him the way loki deviously smirks looking savage and insane yet his speech proclaims him a ruler as he yells at humans to kneel before him tom hiddleston the actor the played loki has perfectly presented his charactercaptain america played by chris evans stays fond of who he is proclaimed he is a brave fearless soldier and his display of leadership is highlighted in battle scenes of the movie iron man aka tony stark played by robert downey jr is the one that makes people laugh during the movie a character full of sarcasm who doesnt play well in a group and has a huge ego doesnt even try to be nice to whoever it is near him the movie is definitely worth watching ps marvel has announced the sequel of the scheduled to 2015,fantasy
the is coming together of all big super heroes together no surprise its going to be huge but this much really  its just not the few super heroes but also the supporting cast who made it a worth watch well guys this movie is for all out there it has actioncomedyemotion and finally super entertainment talking about the 3d effectits awesome particularly in the end this movie is a must watch even if you are not a super heroes movie liker this will surely enthrall youa perfect 10 from me for this movieps watch out for last 30 min actionyou surely had never seen that before,fantasy
joss whedon who has made a name in television namely for angel tv 19992004 firefly tv 20022003 and buffy the vampire slayer tv 19962003 as well as having written the screenplays of toy story 1995 alien resurrection 1997 titan ae 2000 and the concurrently showing cabin in the woods 2012 establishes himself as a fullfledged director with a big bang the features an array of box office stars fantastic special effects and tightlydirected action scenes with a sprinkling of dramatic moments and comedic relief mostly from robert downey jrs wisecracks and clark greggs gaylike adulation of chris evans character the major players iron man thor captain america black widow hawkeye incredible hulk are introduced briefly but markingly and from the onset you know nick fury samuel l jackson has his hands full bringing together this group of superheroes with flamboyantly clashing personalities the tesseract a cosmic cube of debatable origins that has unlimited powers has been stolen and fury assembles the to retrieve this cube villainy is provided deliciously by tom hiddleston as loki and gwyneth paltrow is a welcome addition from downeys iron man films  as well as colbie smulders making her marvel film debut as agent maria hill only the last third of the film loses steam with one vaguely wondering why the robotsattack city scenario is oddly familiar transformers anyone an ambiguous ending also mars the otherwise energetic proceedings with thor accosting his brother loki back to asgard alan silvestris vivid musical score adds to the kinetic frenzy and seamus mcgarveys cinematography is impressive whedon has crafted a wellcrafted action movie with much visceral excitement and an earnest cast,fantasy

i think i just have witnessed the best movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of movies in my lifetime i love the work of joss whedon this is by far his best accomplishment high tech magic appeared on the screen as i watched in aweevery actor played his or her part to the best of their abilities the action was amazing the humor was spot on pure joss style loved itloved it i recommend this movie to everyone it is just pure enjoymenti anxiously await the second installment of the it can only get better from here on out,fantasy
minor spoilers ahead if ever theres a movie for shedding tears of joy this would be it the beauty of seeing a longterm plan come to fruition has a satisfaction hard to replicate in any other fashion thats the feeling youll get after watching the marvels ambitious venture of building up a fivemovie saga in anticipation of one grand epic which ties a ribbon on those movies while simultaneously paving the way for future endeavors not only pays huge dividends but blows up the screen with pure amazement during the process theres a certain awe to behold when watching montage fight scenes seamlessly transition from captain americas groundlevel assault to iron mans flyby attacks to hulks crushing of gigantic enemies theres a sense that theyve got each others back that theyre truly fighting as one team thats the magic that drives the to heightened plateaus of superhero storytelling these have been assembled for this purpose and show that nothing can stop them if they work together its during those scenes that make you think this is what ive been waiting for makes you feel like the kid who fell in love with these stories when first reading the comics its a good thing the superheroes finally start working from the same playbook because the weight of imminent failure is lurking loki returns as the evil leader and hes more power hungry and bent on world control than ever like any superhero movie the bad guys quest to control the world is at the forefront but theres realism and a dark nature to loki that creates a sense of peril and pressure to the task of stopping him it requires sacrifice something some of the need to learn loki is truly twisted believing that mankind needs a ruler so it can be free of freedom it actually gets a little thought provoking throughout the movie theres an unsettling feeling of the grand sinister plot not just a gimmick that most shallow bad guys cling to the is a little darker than the other movies tons of destruction ensues as the scope of the grand battle covers all of manhattan and takes casualties along the way even the backup plan of a nuclear missile wiping out everything comes into play the humor that has made the characters lovable and entertaining is present and accounted for it was a tough balancing act to get the interactions between all the superheroes to seem fitting but director joss whedon concocts the perfect mixture of screen time and blends all the superheroes together brilliantly yes tensions even arise as iron man and thor duke it out from nick fury giving hulk the order to smash to tony stark calling coulson by his first name agent theres plenty of laughs from everyone none of which are contrived okay some are but not any more than any of the other marvel films which is a good thing during some of those interactions a lot is learned about the superheroes theres some back story for black widow and hawkeye that was sorely needed bruce banner has some moments in the sun side note edward norton was a better banner but mark ruffalo did a good job captain america steps up to be the leader he was meant to be at times it seemed like the movie could and maybe even shouldve piggy back on anyone of these stories and flesh it out a little more but whedon did a good job of keeping the movies somewhat broad focus on target special effects were topnotch the art design of enemies for the final battle was creative and organic music was stellar actually it was cool when the musical theme would get switched up a little depending on which superhero was fighting at that particular moment indeed the long wait was worth it the reaches its potential and brings out the giddiness and excitement weve all had for these superhero movies one last note there are two endofcredit scenes so stay all the way through one gives a glimpse of what is to come in future movies thered better be more of them and the other is simply a perfect capper,fantasy
a must watch superhero movie overall its pretty good and very action packed the few problems i would say that kept this movie from being perfect are some character inconsistencies and the need for a stronger antagonist the chemistry between all the characters was great although i would say they got a bit cheesy sometimes i would also have liked to see more back story regarding hawkeye and the black widow most of the movie is shot on the aircraft carrier and in my opinion it did not really pick up until the final scenes the turning point of the film seemed a bit exaggerated to me as well the film did do a good job giving each character enough time on screen to really show the diversity of the super heroes the set pieces were very elaborate and i was never visually unsatisfied overall it was a great film,fantasy
this new superhero flick by marvel is quite good being a fan of many past marvel movies i feel that director joss whedon did give most comic book fans a film that they will remember it is packed with action costumed superheroes villains gadgets plottwists witty dialogue  much like a well written comic strip however for those not entirely familiar with the heroes as well as those who are looking for a more serious plot they wont find anything deep in this flick it is as roger ebert put it the westminster dogshow of superheroes the production team incorporates myriads of digital visual and sonic effects to give filmgoers the biggest bang for their bucknevertheless children will find it very exciting as will most marvel aficionados if you are a sucker for a pleasing fridaynight flick with not too much to offer other than a thrilling starstudded adventure and a number of humorous jests by robert downey jr this is certainly for youenjoy,fantasy
all right everyone knows this movie is awesome and cant be improved without taking away from what made it awesome so we need to focus on how to make the sequel just as awesome so we know thanos will be the next guy to fight but ok obviously even though hes sometimes lame but superbly human is antman pym and the wasp need the wasp because weve now evolved that women can kick ass as much as men and we cant be so unbalanced that black widow takes all the credit but pymthe abusive husband that can make himself big has a lot of potential especially when the seemingly undersized hulk puts him in his place we have a good half hour there of a sequel so lets get other ideas to feed joss wheedon so he can keep on avenging,fantasy
my only complaint about this excellent action movie with strong female characters marvel can we pleeease have a black widow movie now whats her story we want to know shes interesting is that it did not pass the bechdel testfor those of you who dont know this test its three simple questions 1 were there two or more female characters with names 2 did they speak to each other at any time 3 if yes on 2 did they speak to each other about something other than a manthe bad news is that this movie does not pass this test but good writing is good writing and it was so satisfying to see the story overflow with character development cooperation and friendships it was great seeing gorgeous black widow holding the team at the center as a woman okay an asskicking woman with no fuss or sexism just plain old everyday respect fighting her own battles and still be able to have a personal moment full of heart and soulread my essay the perilous pumps of pepper potts about heroines feet and the two main women in this movie at httpwanderingpieblogspotcom201205avengethishtml,fantasy
the is the most fun crowdpleasing movie ive seen in years its no wonder marvels the shattered the box office record with over 200000000 dollars domestic this weekend its barely been out and its made half a billion dollars the has been around for about 50 years and after 5 movies leading up to this the delivers the theater was a mad house when i saw it saturday there were little kids and old people as well this movie is great for all ages the older people finally get to see the super heroes they grew up with finally on the big screen and the little kids will get great role models to look up to the movie puts great emphasis on how teamwork results in victory the character development is great each superhero gets enough screen time but the hulk steels the show and is sure to be everyones favorite the best moments in the movie are when the hulk is on screen they did a good job on showing how captain america assumed the leader position on the team iron man tony stark is witty as always and thor is also cool the team is balanced and everyone even puny hawk eye and black widow contributes this movie has it all great action character development comedy and story it can be a little cheesy but in a good way there are moments when the whole theater will laugh clap and cheer its a fun way to start off summer i know im picking this up as soon as it hits the shelves along with spiderman 2 and dark knight the is one of the best superhero movies to date cant wait for number 2,fantasy
when i first saw the trailer for the i was a little worried that it would just end up being a large special effects feature part of this is because this film has so many big name actors who play so many important roles that one would worry that there would be little character development however this film did not fail me as it kept me on the edge of my seat for all two hoursdespite all of the big names playing big roles i felt that the characters in this movie all seemed to interact quite well with each other this is especially true regarding the conflict that arises between tony stark and steve rogers both personalities fit the superhero they belonged to and both were able to interact well with each otheri feel that joss whedon was the perfect director for this film as it was very inkeeping with his style even in the most action packed scenes the superheroes managed to crack a few jokes will still seeming as though they were taking the crisis seriously and still sticking to the personality and ethos of their characterthis is a modern superhero film to the standards of the special effects were set quite high early on this film without question met those standards when large objects would collide it actually looked like the objects had considerable momentum and were striking other objects with considerable force along with having a satisfying story this film is great eyecandy such a difficult film is however not without a few flaws first is that nick fury is supposed the be a brilliant leader but with so many big characters it was difficult for samuel jacksons acting to shine through the other problem is that loki is supposed to be a brilliant mastermind but he never acts like it he simply comes off as a villain who was powerhungry and in the end was consumed by his own ego my final problem is one that may possibly explained with more knowledge of the marvel universe but i find it a little difficult to foresee that all along lokis plan inside shields ship was to make bruce banner lose control of himself and become the hulk this did in fact happen however when in manhattan banner was suddenly able to harness his powers to fight against loki in a relatively controlled way that involved taking orders from captain america i simply do not see how he is loses control in hulk form in one instance and is able to control himself in another instance these however are small issues and do not take much away from the overall quality of the moviethe bottom line is that this is definitely a good movie that hopefully preps us for what is about to come soon in the dark knight rises i intend to see this film again after some time and i am guessing that i will probably enjoy it,fantasy
loki has come to earth and stolen an ancient artifact that will give him unlimited power shield gathers a group of superheroes which they call the to defeat the evil okay the villains and their goals are kind of lame disappointing because loki was a great villain in thor  although i must say tom hiddleton is still very good in the role but the focus of this film is mostly the superheroes iron man captain america thor the hulk black widow and hawkeye  with all of these guys this movie should be a total mess but the screenwriters joss whedon  zak penn have handled it beautifully meting out dozens of great moments for all of them not letting any one of them take over although the hulk almost does just because hes so awesome  funny as hes never had a successful solo movie nor fall behind and never seeming too hard like its trying to do that there are times when the film is too thick with exposition but the characters and the actors are all so good that it rarely drags theres one long sequence where a bunch of characters are fighting amongst themselves that i thought felt a tad forced the heroes personalities and histories are utilized in impressive ways  i especially love the way they use captain americas datedness one particularly hilarious gag  and whedon does a great job with the comic moments  has captain america feeling overjoyed at finally getting a reference when someone refers to the wizard of oz that this movie is anywhere near as good as it is is something of a miracle its pretty much the perfect summer movie  everything else this summer is going to have a lot to live up to,fantasy
the meanest and most awesome comicbookflick ive seen in a long time the has it alli am a very big hulk fan and thats what shows in the movie along with the title of this review i am writing it only falls short of the christopher nolan directed the dark knightthe cast of characters is very good unparalleled to be exact as i liked edward nortonin the incredible hulk2008 more cause he did portray puny banner better trust me when i say because he resembles the most with the original bruce banneror the puny banner thats what the hulk calls him in the comics what can i say ed norton did not sign a longer contract with marvel  now lets get to the movieno spoilers for people who have not seen this movie cause i really want everyone to see it nick fury knows that the world is under threat and he plans to defend it with everything and anything he has he has got one scientist who can become a noble laurette in a subject in one night he has a super soldier who woke up after eight decades one demigod who controls thunderandlightening one sexysuperhotspy who would do anything for what she believes a guy with exceptional killing skills who could shoot a bird from a mile with a bow and arrow and the incredible hulk loki played by tom hiddlestone is perfectjust not as menacing as the comic books however the movie unfolds with unknown enemies from the sky like the ones never seen before and more this movie is about not one man or superherothough it begs to be what i mean is if the hulk is taken out dunno who would have woni am definitely biased here you see i heard the most whistles and applaud when bruce banner came back to manhattan on a bloody old motor bike in ragged clothes both the times i went to see the movie and i agree with themfor those who came in late please watch all the movies i am listing here hulk2003 the incredible hulk2008 iron man2008 iron man 22010 captain america2011 and thor2011 you need to see all the titles to know what is happening and please please please dont forget to see the end credits as marvel packs a punch in the endpost credits scene those are the most important scenes if you want to follow a series finale such as thei am waiting for iron man3 thor2 and the hulk  reboot series from marvel before another hulk movie in 2015possibly sorry mark ruffalo but ed norton was more convincing screaming hulk smash than you however you did a great job taking over from him hats off to josh whedon for this awesome flick i witnessedlooking for more from you josh  910 for your effort,fantasy
im not going to try to win everyone over by giving my review a cheesy overdone headline im not also going to try to persuade you by comparing this movie to christopher nolans batman movies i am a fan of both dc and marvel comics when people do so it drives me nuts so im not going to give a review bashing the other like a lot of fans on here so that being said the is a great movie all the movies that lead up to this film made this one a fantastic start to what could be an even better new saga from the getgo this movie starts out with what the rest of it will bring i for one think sometimes 2 12 hours for a movie is a little drawn out and very few times i have sat through a movie that long and felt i was short changed it is very entertaining very funny and full of action joss whedon truly lifted these characters from the pages of the comic into real life go see the movie i saw it in 3d imax but to be honest any form of this movie is going to be just as great if you enjoyed the last actual marvel movies that lead us to this point you definitely wont be disappointedstay for at least the first after credit footage if youre an avenger comic fan like i am you will grin from ear to ear,fantasy
if i was to describe the in a single word it would be this nirvana the film wants for nothing theres action story character development and well placed humor bits its everything we were promised and nothing we werent you want super hero conflicts you got em you want gratuitous amounts of action you got it you want stan a lee cameo better question could it be an avenger movie at this point without one you want hulk smash you bet your sweet candy ass hulk smash there are a few nitpicky things that i could say about the movie but they all fall wildly short of what the movie gets right this movie is a rock star affair from start to finish with the screen play by joss whedon geeks try to hold it together and visual and sound effects done by none other than weta studios and skywalker light and soundyou already know the cast we all know the score so its time to strap in and enjoy the ride and you had best strap in since the pace for after the intro sequence is somewhere between frenetic and murderous there really is no lull in the story or the action that lasted longer than my attention span and thats saying something for a man with adhd there really is an awful lot crammed into that 2 hours and 23 minutes and believe me they make use of damn near every second with so many stars though it is true that some character development got sacrificed most notably for hawkeye but it seems to have done very little to diminish the film as a wholein a somewhat crossrelated issue the substitution of mark ruffalo for edward norton as bruce bannerthe hulk was a much welcome change in my opinion the skinny around town is that norton wanted more money than marvel was willing to put up and negotiations broke down bet hell be kicking himself in the ass for that choice come monday especially considering how many fans of the hulk this film is likely to generate but ive always found norton to be a little annoying and ruffalo does a great job but thats just my opinion all the other characters are amazing too cap is great iron man steals the stage whenever he can but not as much as i thought he would and thor actually levels out a bit to make a fuller transition from brash youth to wise veteran warriora final word on 3d and imax see it in imax 3d its absolutely astounding catch the matine showing if you have to but dont miss your chance because it really does impact the cinematic experience and as always stay after the credits and i do mean stay after all the credits seriously you wont want to miss itpeace outso will change the entire world as we know it no probably not but it will set a precedent and a higher standard for all other films to follow,fantasy
i went into this with guarded optimism lets face it the movies that led up to it were fun but nothing more but after seeing this movie it not only gets my nod for best superhero movie ever its probably going right into my top 10 alltime moviesdirector whedon has proved that he can take intense action witty dialogue and some real emotion and tie them all together into a package that never feels forced too often ensemble movies like this try too hard to manufacture tension between members or artificially manufacture importance for one character at the expense of another but everything here flows the have always involved internal conflict and the movie portrays it perfectly without going over the top or underplaying it at any point its also obvious that there is real love and respect for the characters as it all feels true to how they were originally written in all ways a true winner,fantasy
just watch it today at imax 3d i must say that my expectation were so high before watching this movie and who werent and the results i must say that joss whedon as a director and zak penn as a writer had done a marvelous jobwatched the trailer all the timeand i must say that my hype were so high but i kinda prepare for a bang boom explosion everywhere without a truly coherent script or characterization like transformers trilogybut what did i get i can see all heroes in this movies shared a very good balance and portion screen time with a very good humanity in them superheroes dont make them as super heartdo they and raise your handthe one who thought that hawkeye and black widow is less useful than the superpower oneu owe one of good reminder if thats sothe jokes were so greatit comes at the right time and moment the action were cool and breathtakingbut this is the from my view it lacks a truly great archenemy but will not worrying it to much for the sequel spoiler for the postending sceneoverall great summer action starts make sure to watch it,fantasy
the has been years in the making the budget cast director and storyline show just how much effort has been put into this movie the graphics are unbeatable the director was able to bring life to the characters while making the film as fastpassed as it needed to be to top it off the cast bill consisted of samuel l jackson robert downey jr mark ruffalo scarlett johansson and many more the storyline was unlike anything i have seen in a superhero movie before although it did remind me of chronicle at timesthe only problem with the is the script that joss whedon wrote he may be a great director but that does not mean he should also be a screenwriter with such talented actors far too many lines were simplified or dropped completely at times the dialogue just feels like filler until the action starts again however there is one upside to having joss whedon do the screenplay hes quite funny from a remark about legalas to plenty of hulk jokes he knows how to make a theatre roll with laughterone of the fears that comes with making a beloved bookcomic book into a movie is that it will be difficult to follow if you are not a fan i for one have never picked up a comic book in my life aside from minor aspects the scene after the credits the science behind superpowers etc there is almost nothing in the that will trip you up there is even enough backstory in the first hour of the movie that you dont need to have seen the five prequelswith a 200 million opening weekend the will likely go down as one of the highest grossing movies of all timenext to star wars iv star wars i titanic the dark knight and avatar although the fits in well with these movies it is rather unique the studio behind this movieuniversalwas able to manufacture this monster of a film by carefully crafting teaser movies over the past several years it is quite unlike anything the movie industry has ever seen the may not be the best movie out there but it will be known as a gamechanger in the movie industry expect movie teaser movies and manufactured blockbusters in the years aheadto be perfectly honest the only people who shouldnt see this movie are those who dont like action movies the is nowhere close to being one of the best movies of the year however it will go down in history not only as a movie that smashed box office records but as the movie that changed the meaning of blockbuster like jaws and towering inferno of the 1970s this movie will change the course of hollywood and how studios vie for the top spot at the box officereillyreviewswordpresscom,fantasy
i just seen this movie what a roller coaster ride to those who say it is a waste of time it is not if you want to see a movie that is hard comic book superhero lore then dont go if you want to be entertained and what a great time them go the move does take liberties with the and at time it slows down but it is needed over all a great ride two things you keep in mind when you go see it1 the 3d was done in postproduction so this movie was not filmed for 3d standard def is just fine and bit more clear in the standard def2 ok for families and small kids i have seen children from 4 on up you might have to explain somethings like big words and certain situations but nothing majorenjoy,fantasy
the 2012 is the newest film from marvel studios  disney studios with the classic superheroes directed by joss whedon from tv series buffy the vampire slayer and starring multiple characters from other movies together for the first time robert downey jr tony starkiron man chris evans steve rogerscaptain america mark ruffalo bruce bannerthe hulk chris hemsworth thor scarlett johansson natasha romanoff  black widow jeremy renner clint bartonhawkeye tom hiddleston loki and samuel l jackson nick furythe film follows the ending hook given after the credits of thor in 2011 just a note there is also one in this movie but before the credits for a sequence of with the cube tesseract of captain america 2011 being in the hands of shield that analyzes it and loki thor being the main villain who seeks it and that is brought to earth by its activation so that with the help of a mysterious ally and his interdimensional army he cans conquer and actually dominate the earth as a rulerdue to these growing threats in the story shield active the plan from a team of superheroes the with the heroes mentioned above to help prevent the plans of lokivisually the film is one of marvels most well made with action scenes to the level of iron man but more intense the downsides of characters of other films that were not as successful as thor and hulk were corrected here and the characters have greater expressionof course in terms of special effects there is nothing wrong  the scenes are very intense and uses it very well and are impressive in some parts as well as the fight sequences between the charactersmusically i am without criticism as all the movies from marvel the orchestrated soundtrack fits perfectly with the action  the same can be said of the sound effects used in the filmthe performances are excellent each character is significant in themselves in the story and their different personalities are displayed perfectly even in characters without much impact on earlier moviesthe differences in personalities secured a good laugh as well as some comic lines and scenes thus the entire cast came to life  even loki in the role of the eternal loserand tell by the way i thought that no character has been erased by the presence of another despite the stronger personality in the movie of tony stark to be the most strikingthe story itself is not worthy of an oscar for best screenplay but this is not the intention of the film  but the fun is remember that this is the basic reason to watch movies and at this point it beat my expectations being almost as good as xmen first classone of the constant criticism that i have seen is about the main villain loki said to be too weak for the role i think he fits the role allocated to him as is evident through the story itself the comic lines and the bonus credits hook  i think a greater villain is reserved for the sequelin short it is a great action movie with a solid script for the style with excellent performances and visual effects  and it is what you want when you go to watch something in cinemas looking for fun pure and simpleit serves as a reminder because every year we expect so much to see the upcoming movie from marvel  dc comics  my score 90  100,fantasy
the muchhyped superhero ensemble project finally sees manifestation on the big screen the wait has been worth itensemble projects like this always carry the risk of being bloated or ruined by overkill thankfully joss whedon sees fit to not only give each of his superpowered protagonists ample screen time but also effective characterisations too hell even hawkeye and black widowtwo characters who were treated as mere appendages in previous marvel flickshave a strong presence here tom hiddleston makes a mischievous antagonist playing loki as a megalomaniacal jack the lad with a potty mouth never thought id hear the term mewling quim in a mainstream allages flick but the strongest standout for me has to be mark ruffalos everonedge performance as that big green wrecking machine the hulkactionwise theres no disappointment with each setpiece giving our heroes an excuse to show off their pet powers if the ensemble panning shot during the climactic battle doesnt win some sort of award for camerawork and direction ill be very surprised the real mastery comes from the entwining of characterisation and conflict with the course of the latter very much informed by and informing the formerin short this is a mustsee as a supe move a summer blockbuster and an allround great piece of action cinema,fantasy
this by far is the best super hero action movie ever forget the actors forget the graphics and forget the heroics of the hulk the script is so captivating and the screen play so damn good that it is impossible to feel unimpressed when one leaves the show i rate this 9 just because i happen to watch it with 5 of my friends none of the group watching any of the original films of the super heroes they were confused initially till i find sometime and give them the brief of each of them and when the movie finished they were grinning ear to ear with a promise to watch all 5 movies of the super hero movies that captivating this movie is the movie predictably starts slow so as to introduce the superheroes and then picks up speed never to stop the goosebumps were felt till i left the place to return the 3d glasses dthen comes the performances everyone gave their best performance and the list is topped by the performances of robert downie jr mark ruffalo hiddleston and cobie smulders the dialogs were crisply written entertainingly delivered and thoroughly enjoyed the 3d was not so worthy to die for it my be the theater or the glasses but it is not up to the mark of not even mysterious island as i found one of my friend just removing the glasses and watching the film as is the cgi was good iron man just awesome and hulk no words i have found the trailers good but living through the scene of the group of super heroes is just a brain freezing experience for mego watch it and enjoy it definitely can be watched in 3d but 2d in a good theater works just fine i will watch it again and might probably buy a dvdbluray for my 42 deal,fantasy
i first have to say i saw the film in 2d none of this 3d nonsense for me and even so i did find some of the scenes very dark also the aspect ratio at 1781 seemed totally wrong to me most films these days are shot in a ratio of 2351 and i cant see why this one had to be different it may be a 3d thing but it niggled me slightly as far as performances go well everyone did a great job but i particularly liked tom hiddleston as lokiof course there are plot holes here as there are in all superhero films and im not going to chime on about them now im sure there are many out there that are better qualified than me so ill leave it to them what i took away from it was a very entertaining film with a lot of sometimes subtle humour and i really enjoyed it the narrative did seem to get a little stuck in a couple of places though like when thor arrived and ended up having a fight with iron man but i can forgive these because as a whole it all worked pretty well i was a little disappointed with the backstory to black widow and hawkeye it was only alluded to quite briefly and i guess because they are more minor characters i wanted to know a little more about them but over all i must say its well worth the admission fee highly recommendedmy score 8910imdb score 8810 based on 65676 votes when this review was writtenmetascore 69100 based on 40 critic reviews provided by metacriticcom at the time of going to pressrotten tomatoes tomatometer score 93100 based on 230 reviews counted at the time of going to pressrotten tomatoes audience score 96100 based on 199821 user ratings counted at the time of going to pressyou can find an expanded version of this review on my blog thoughts of a steelmonster,fantasy
after finally watching it i see what the hype was all about with a cornucopia of extraordinary and awesome special effects the is truly the bestsuper hero film an ensemble movie that intermingles four major marvel characters into one awesome movie that has all what a comic fan would wanta fight scene between two of the most powerful and popular character iron man and thor and the combined force of the shown in one movie not only does it rise in special effects and cinematography the superhero extravaganza also has its characters well depicted with powerful the acting wit of chris hemsworth robert downey and the many others humor is also a major component that whedon doesnt seem to forget however at times it seems a bit supererogatory looking at it from a general view the film seems superior to any other marvel film however its most obvious downside is the hulks lack of humanity which left him with almost nothing but a child playing around with a dollalthough it was truly jocular overall marvels the is a great film that will surely quench the thirst of many actionmovie goers while having some dramatic and a few romantic scenes for othergenre of movie goers its truly a movie worth watchingthe movie of 2012 not only has the movie been praised for its special affects and acting but it has also broken many records internationally waiting for this weekends predicted staggering results i have high expectations,fantasy
the five stars out of five joss whedon directed and cowrote with zak penn this long awaited film adaptation of the marvel comic book marvel studios has been building a story arc to this film through five other individual comic book superhero movies 2008s iron man and the incredible hulk 2010s iron man 2 and 2011s thor and captain america they brought on whedon who many comic book and film fans worship to cowrite and direct the film and being a true comic book fan himself he knew exactly what the fans wanted to see robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner samuel l jackson tom hiddleston clark gregg stellan skarsgard gwyneth paltrow and paul bettany all reprise their roles from other marvel comics movies and mark ruffalo was brought in to replace edward norton as the hulk the movie is a comic book fans orgasmic dream come true all other film fans and audiences should be more than pleased as well thoughthe story of the revolves around the world peace keeping agency known as shield nick fury jackson once again is the director of the agency and has spent the last five marvel movies recruiting superheroes for a special team known as the when loki hiddleston again brother of thor invades the planet and steals the tesseract which he uses to control the minds of multiple shield agents including hawkeye renner again its finally time for fury to call on the to assemble and save the world loki wants to use the tesseract to enslave the planet unless captain america iron man thor hulk and the others can stop him the heroes must work through their own inner demons and conflicts with each other before they can work as a team and find the strength they need to stop loki and his armyi was expecting something much more campy and mainstream fun but whedon takes the material very seriously and actually structured a really well written story which develops all of the key characters pretty evenly with the exception of hawkeye most comic movies kind of cheat their fans by trying more to appeal to the masses whereas this film makes the comic book audience its target audience as it should it doesnt do so to the extent of losing the interest of everyone else though for me i much more enjoyed the dark knight spider man 2 or x2 as far as comic book films go but i can really appreciate this film it doesnt give me as big a boner as a lot of my comic book friends but its definitely a crowd pleasing action film and one of the best of its kind i dont know as much about the source material as comic book nerds but i know a good movie and this is one whedon was definitely the right man for the jobwatch our movie review show movie talk at httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvcnk88xwi4a4,fantasy
i waited a long time for this movie and the payoff was definitely worth it measly words like epic or awesome are not even close to describing this brilliant film this movie is jampacked with action explosions fight scenes and comedy there is never a dull moment and time just flies by during this 142 minute extravaganza the agency of shield accidentally use the tesseract to open a mysterious portal and unleashes thors evil brother loki loki brainwashes dr selvig and hawkeye to help him bring his army the chitauri to earth nick fury assembles iron man captain america black widow and the incredible hulk to help stop him thor joins the group later thor is my absolute favorite avenger and he had some decent action scenes and funny moments i wish he had a little more screen time tony stark and steve rogers often clash with each other but they must all work together to defeat loki and becomethe,fantasy
there is only a few things i would like to share i have not seen a movie that amazed me this much until the day i watched the i do not want to point out any specific parts of the movie but i want to say this this movie is a compilation of brilliant acting fluent action the amazing fantasy world for the ones that love the comic books and comedy that leaves a smile on your face throughout the entire movie i must say i wasnt expecting this much fun the only thing that stood out for me was the appearance of the hulk it was very good but not perfect i dont know about the current technology for these kinda stuff but i think it could have been done a bit more realistic anyway for those who didnt watch the movie i strongly recommend that you watch this movie immediately i guarantee you it will not be a waste of time on the contrary i believe you will love it i know i did and so did a hundred of my friends i am definitely buying the dvd or bluray as soon as it hits the stores,fantasy
this movie rocks ive been waiting for this movie for 37 years joss whedon nailed it the action is paced just right with a good amount of one liners to keep it light robert downey jr has a lot of fun as tony stark the story works well and the actors sell their roles with ease i wasnt sure about mark ruffalo as bruce banner he did alright but hes a little too beefy to be bruce all the other actors have played their characters before and this just cements their position this movie is better than any of the solo hero movies that led up to it hopefully joss comes back for the next one and can pull it off again i saw the imax 3d version and while it looked and sounded fantastic the 3d didnt pop as much as it could have it had some depth but it didnt really add much it should make a substantial amount at the the box office and should get a few nods for the oscars but we all know that wont happen the academy always passes over movies like this i just want to state again this is a great movie action packed and hilarious,fantasy
2008 and we were teased with noting but samuel l jackson saying im here to talk to you about the initiative in iron manfast forward though incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america now here we are in 2012 people had doubts about the but those people are wrongfirst off i got to see at midnight release here in canada and the energy was terrific everyone was excited and everyone was respectful of staying quiet during the movie we couldnt help it however when laughs came up because the is hilarious the jokes are very well written tony stark is his usual self and cap is now trying to adjust to modern day thor being from asgard is also confused by some of our customs and sayings and example being when nick fury refers to loki and his trained monkeys and thor questions what monkeys arejoss whedon wrote and directed this movie to a wonderful extent he knew every turn and plot point he wanted for the movie and theres no better way this movie couldve turned outi cant describe the great joy i feel from seeing this movie and once is not enough i could go on and on about it the acting the fight scenes mark ruffalo being the best hulkbruce banner yet and how i without exaggeration had a smile the entire movie but its something you must experience for yourselfenjoy i highly highly recommend this movie,fantasy
short and sweet probably the best superhero movie ever made i went in to this with some trepidation most flicks with an ensemble cast waste way too much time and energy on the special effects and action and not enough on character development like those horrible batman flicks prechristopher nolan but the avangers are the exception to the rule this was just a fantastic movie the fight scenes and action moments were spectacular without going over the top ala transformers and the character development and interaction was superb and totally entertaining some of the most enjoyable moments of the movie was the banter between the characters and i wont ruin this for anyone but stay for the end to catch a glimpse of the next bad guy apparently its been announced on the web but i didnt know until i seen the film i was blown away he looked awesome what a great flick,fantasy
i went to this movie going oh my god michael bay meets spderman vs x men or something i didnt really had high hopes for it but i figured what the hell and went to see it anywayjust came back from the cinema and i must say i havent been this entertained in a long time watching a movie the is really a lot of fun to watchfirst off the scenario sure the story is a bit shaky a few plot holes here and there but nothing that makes you go wtf is this nonsense for a story that covers such a weird unrealistic theme its pretty believable actuallythe characters this is where the shines throw a bunch of some less well known superheroes in 1 movie throw in a semislapstick villain and let rip all the characters are good stark thor and hulk provide the lulz even loki allows for a few laughs ive never heard of black widow or hawkeye but they fit in just fine and carried the story alongthe action michael bay take note this is how you let stuff blow up and get demolished without giving the audience seizures the action is fast paced well times and the screenplay at times is just brilliant hats offthe humor the backbone of this film very witty lines good slapstick jokes from time to time some hilarious punchlines that really make you laugh its not just iron man and his snide remarks this time almost everyone chips in this movie doesnt take itself very serious at times and thats a very good thingif youre a superhero fan go see this you simply cannot be disappointed i think i myself am no superhero fan but i was entertained for the whole 25 hours the film went on not 1 moment boredwhat a laugh,fantasy
this movie is all about the hype its existence is based on four years of gradually building anticipation in the nerd community so that now some of us are at the breaking point waiting for what we all hope could be the perfect movie the big question on all of our minds is was it worth the wait my response to that question is yes the is shockingly good in every waythe plot concerns loki god of mischief who after receiving a magic death wand from some aliens yeah thats about how much they tell you about it comes to earth steals the mysterious otherworldly megabattery the cosmic cube last seen in captain america from the supersecret spy organization shield he kidnaps a few of their scientists and agents and takes off concerned nick fury the director of shield played by a very awesome samuel l jackson with no hair and an eye patch wants to begin rounding up earths mightiest heroes to combat the threat the government argues that it doesnt make sense to round up civilians who happen to have acquired powers and expect them to act as a dependable military task force fury argues that they dont have a dependable military taskforce equipped to handle a god and an invading alien army so he goes ahead and does it anywayhis heroes consist of iron man who has just completed work on an energy efficient tower that he cant seem to stop talking about the true significance of which doesnt come to light until the very end of the movie captain america who is understandably depressed since waking up seventy years after he last fell asleep and is trying to figure out if he has any place in the new world thor who is obviously having some personal issues because he feels responsible for his brother lokis actions black widow who is technically not an avenger but just a really talented agent who hangs out with them and hawkeye who is also just an agent but happens to be really good with a bow so he also gets to hang out with thei cannot express in words just how impressed i am that each character gets enough screen time to satisfy both the needs to see them and to have them grow in complexity somehow over the course of its two hour run time it manages to do justice to each of its characters simultaneously by bouncing their personalities off one anotherthe action is plentiful and awesome the first half to three quarters of the film the heroes are fighting one another as their confliction agendas bring them to trade blows and that is entertaining we get to see hulk fight thor thor fight iron man black widow fight hawkeye black widow running in terror from hulk etc this is all unbelievably good fun and they all get to show off the full brunt of their powers because the other heroes are tough enough to take it when they finally do make peace with one another and get down to fighting the bad guys there as an endless wave of faceless aliens for them to tear in twosmashelectrocuteexplodeshootwhatever without you caring about the deaths that come as a resultnow for the bad parts and there were a couple the opening action sequence when loki destroys the underground shield base is too long and too boring also loki gives these weird speeches throughout the movie about how freedom is stifling or something and they didnt make sense given his character he doesnt need more motivation than wanting to be a king to be doing what hes doing and at the very least they could have done a better job explaining his feelings about freedom i think i figured it out anyways but ill leave the interpretation to each audience member also there is a great scene where thor is defending lokis honor in the face of the understandable accusations coming from his teammates only to insist that lokis only his adopted brother two seconds later for the sake of a gag it bothered me a lot because it was really interesting to see him still caring for his wayward family member despite his wrongdoings and what was with that alien loki was talking to the one with the two thumbs it looked moved spoke and was filmed like something out of a bad sixties scifi movie and i mean the really bad kind in a movie filled with awesomeness it stood out like a sore thumb or two sore thumbs given its bizarre anatomy spoiler alert skip to the next paragraph if you havent seen the movie at the end of the movie when doctor selvig announces that while under lokis mind control he maintained enough presence of mind to install a failsafe kill switch into the portal generator i couldnt help but feel that the screenwriters had taken the lazy way out the fact that he did that makes all of their collective actions basically irrelevant and it undermines both their superiority and their heroism in no small way essentially they won the war because some guy didnt mind control very well and thats really lame this was the weakest point in the film and i feel very strongly that theres no particular reason that hulk couldnt have just smashed his way through the unsmashable force fieldin the end the movie is unbelievably good fun and surprisingly satisfying given the wait it homages the characters and the stories of all the movies that have come before and it leads into whatever comes next very well oh and stay after the credits theres an awesome clip for anyone patient enough to wait and i dont mean the one with the aliens i mean after the longer credits,fantasy
remember how last year we were met with an unusual abundance of superhero flicks focusing on heroes that seemed to have come out of nowhere it was all buildup to marvels the one of the most anticipated films of 2012 this is the first time i sought out a superhero film in theaters i usually dont see them because ive never cared for them theyre not my kind of thingthis is the freddy vs jason for superhero fans the story goes like this after nick fury jackson leader of the agency shield discovers that an energy source by the name of tesseract has opened a portal allowing thors brother loki hiddleston to use the sources ability to control the minds of people he calls together the they are the hulk ruffalo iron man downey jr hawkeye renner captain america evans thor hemsworth and black widow johannson only two of those characters never got their own film isnt that something captain america can get three iron man can get two with an upcoming third one and hulk can get two nonrelated works within the same decade but black widow and hawkeye get the cold shoulder guess no one wants to pull another green lanternthe first hour of the film is notsomuch devoted to character development as much as character interactions how do heroes react to being a room with other heroes theres a nice feeling of uncertainty amongst the crowd and we get the feeling these heroes are intimidated by the presence of possible competition the feeling of inferiority is always lurkingdirectorwriter joss whedon whose subversive horror film the cabin in the woods is also currently in theaters has two great things going for him right now one he speaks to the world of fandom and nerdom and never disconnects himself from this sort of medium you can see he likes these heroes and he tries to imagine how their interactions and conversations mightve gone on the pages of a comic and two he knows how to devise a brutal relentlessly intriguing third act that never relapses im not the biggest fan of hardcore lengthy action scenes but the halfhour to forty minute brawl in the didnt bother me mainly because i realized whedon wanted to showcase all the different possibilities that could exist if six superheros fought against one destructive villainnot to mention how difficult it mustve been to construct a film where six different heroes come together for the first time whedon has the task of mixing the patriotism of captain america the shameless cynicism of tony stark the demigodabilities of thor the subtleties of hawkeye the wiseremarks of black widow and the anger of the hulk into one coherent film the result is superb commendable and utterly terrific each character too gets their own time to shine rather than some going unsung and others fighting to get in front of the camera in a look at me ma sort of fashionin the mix of all the violence talking and scientific jargon occasionally comes a nice sprinkling of humor and wit most of the humor comes from the wiseass stark whose comedic timing and infinite possibilities may lead me to seek out iron man and its sequelmarvels the may appear to be another superhero flick just with more heroes and less villains but its the effort that shines through the material the effort determination and challenge of combining six different heroes was definitely something to overcome and joss whedon who is by no means a newcomer with a resume comprised of the television shows angel and buffy the vampire slayer has made an explosive mainstream debut with a film that dripped potential this is a kinetic and stylistic piece of work from a man i believe just getting startednote just to fuel the tired joke of black widow and hawkeye never getting their own picture anyone else anticipating the antman film in 2014 starring robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston and samuel l jackson directed by joss whedon,fantasy
in 2008 marvel studios gave us the first film adaptation of its super hero iron man with the promise of big things to come the film was an astounding success proving that batman wasnt the only hero that can have a good movie what followed was four more films the hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america all critical and financial successes and all leading up to one massive blowout known as the culminating all five films into one massive adventure was a seemingly impossible task however writerdirector joss whedon somehow against all odds pulled it off in a big wayits something that has never been done before in film taking these characters who have proved they are strong enough to carry a film by themselves and putting them all together in one overarching continuity the problems that could arise from this concept are endless and yet this films works not only does it work its so brilliantly pieced together that it is destined to become the greatest super hero movie ever madejoss whedon of firefly and buffy fame is no stranger to creating stories featuring ensemble casts the contrasting personalities of the team play a large role and whedon explores this with astounding fervor this is a character study as much as an action film and the witty dialogue whedon brings to the table only enhances the personalities of these extraordinary individuals the banter between the heroes during lulls in the action is just as engaging as the mindblowing action itselfand the action will blow your mind the main reason most people want to go see this film is to see the kick some ass and there is no shortage of asskickery happening in this film although the hulk steals most of the jawdropping moments even the lower tier characters of black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner get just as much screen time and each have their own wow momentsone thing that is an absolute must when having such an overpowered team like this is having a worthy adversary tom hiddlestons character of loki plays the perfect villain and what better an adversary than a crazed god and his army when it was first revealed that loki was the films antagonist the initial fear was that we already saw thor defeat loki in his own movie so why is there a need for the to be involved when we already know thor can beat him single handedly fortunately this and all the other fanboy and critics questions are addressed and taken into considerationsince i was a child i have always talked about the prospect of an movie and it looked so unattainable that it seemed like it would forever remain just a 12 year olds dream having previously dreamt of a gi joe movie it comes as no surprise when the was announced i was left with cautious optimism much to my delight it seems that joss whedon was somehow able to look into my soul and produce the best comic book movie ever made the is a masterpiece and should be placed on the mantle of greatness beside star wars and indiana jonesfilmpulsenet,fantasy
the hype was building for a few years now about this movie we waited i have have waited over 40 years for a proper big screen adaption of my favorite comic book herothe hulkthank you marvel thank you very very muchi read the as a kidbut againmainly for the hulkthe hulk has always represented to mewhat i believe is what us normal people wish we could doget mad and and smash stuff we finally had a chance to see personality in both banner and the hulkand audience connectedwell at least the cheers and claps led me to believe sothe other characters were awesome alsoespecially iron manmarvel has hit a home run in more ways than one hopefully they wont take too long for the followup moviesafter allthe actors and actresses are not getting any youngerseriouslyi rarely get out to the moviesbut i am very happy that my son and i went this morning i cannot say it enough timesthis movie rocked there better be another hulk moviewith some real action this time we already know another has to happenwow,fantasy
this is the first review i have written on this website but having seen some of the negative reviews for what i feel is a brilliant film i felt the need to weigh inthe does everything that it sets out to do perfectly it pulls of huge action scenes with 6 major characters without making them compete for screen time it has funny and clever dialogue and it manages to actually give the film a strong sense of continuity with the previous titles in the series in a way which works very welli saw this film with my 13 year old brother and for once we both agreed with regards to our opinion of a film we loved it the action was impressive the jokes were funny and the characters were likablethe main area of criticism i have seen so far seems to be that this movie does not deserve to be held in the same regard as other high scoring films on this website all i can say is that this film is pure and simple fun it is well worth the money and is well worth your time to go and see a film doesnt have to be meaningful or deep to be great it just has to be an experience and the jaw dropping excitement i felt towards the climax of this film is not something i will soon forget,fantasy
definitely one of the best superhero movies ever everything about the movie was awesome the storyline was great fit well with the previous marvel movies iron man captain america thor and hulk all their movies now seem to have a common purpose to converge and culminate into an epic story guaranteed entertainmentthe premise remains the same as that of any other superhero movie the earth is in peril and its fate depends on a handful of superhumans a super villain has a cunning masterplan recruit a deadly alien army let them loose on earth then rule it transformers did that too and it was all chaos the story here was far better woven with all loose threads from previous movies tied up neatlywhen a powerful thing goes into the wrong hands and the fate of the world is at stake nick furyjackson assembles the most extraordinary team to retrieve it hulk ruffalo captain america evansblack widowjohansson hawkeyerenner iron man rdj and thor hemsworth embark on a mission to stop loki hiddleston from taking over the earththe performances of all the actors were great but the real showstealer was rdj the witty comments and the hilarious banter by stark kept everyone gripped throughout the story there are instances where youll laugh out loud in really serious situations the way the humor has been intricately embedded in such a grave storyline is lovely among the awesome story fantastic direction and spectacular cinematics the 142 min running time seems too short every main character has hisher moment of glory all the hype which this movie has created is totally justified go in with high expectations thou shant be disappointed,fantasy
at the beginning of the film when the first action scene came out i was like thats cool then i realized it was the prologue to the film itself and thought holy sh1t that was an awesome intro seriously guys if youre thinking of going to see the film you should slap yourself in the face for being unsure about whether or not you should go this is hands down one of the best films of the year if the quality of iron man iron man 2 and captain america had an threesome this would be the result i had lock jaw for about 30 minutes afterwards because throughout the whole movie i was in such awe that my mouth literally stayed open seriously i couldnt even chew my popcorn after 20 minutes of watching the movie with that said make sure you eat your snacks fast cause after 20 minutes youll be drooling so much you wont be able to eat,fantasy
for pure entertainment this movie cannot be surpassed not only does the movie entertain it does it well the movie is not only wellacted it has a great story with snappy dialog impeccably delivered by an allstar cast the special effects are phenomenal and the movie succeeds in keeping and maintaining the audiences interest and attention even the bad guys are wonderful this movie is probably the best scifi action movie in years perhaps in all of cinematic history it combines all of the best features of the scifi genre plus a generous inclusion of amusing oneliners which lets the audience know that this movie is supposed to be fun to watch here the director succeeds in transforming a comicbook story into a something substantive and enjoyable for these reason this movie is worth watching,fantasy
after four years of anticipation joss whedons the hits theaters and of course it is really good there was no doubt in my mind that this movie wouldnt be good and if it disappointed itd still be looked back on as the culmination of the marvel cinematic universei think whedon is the only one who is able to put a movie like this together im not a huge fan of buffy the vampire hunter firefly or some of whedons other works but he does have a knack for taking a bunch of different characters and making them all relevant and he brings that trademark talent to this movie every hero is given just enough screen time we see captain americas struggle of pulling his team together we see the regret thor has for having to battle his brother we see hulks desperate attempts to control the other guy and we see tony stark as the narcissistic playboy thats always equipped with a great onelinerone thing that sort of concerned me about the was loki as the villain i thought he was great in thor but it seemed kind of weak to have all these great heroes teaming up against a reused villain from a previous prequel fortunately i was one hundred percent wrong loki is great as a villain hes more intense and less whiny combine that with a lust for power and an army of aliens and youve got one of the greatest villains in the entire marvel cinematic universethe effects are great of course youve seen the trailers for this im sure so you know that the movies climax takes place in manhattan it was gripping exciting and even laced with a bit of comedy with none of it being offensive or racist the entire time i just kept thinking to myself that this is what transformers dark of the moon should have been i can see who the heroes are and even identify with them while the action is entertaining and not too longfinal verdict the summer movie season hasnt been kicked off this well since the first iron man movie ever since christopher nolans the dark knight ive been waiting for another superhero movie to come along and do something new and the has done just that it takes a very basic traditional story and amps it up its smartly handled well made and most importantly a lot of fun i look forward to taking another trip to the theater to go and see it,fantasy
if youre looking for a fun time at the movies this weekend look no further there was just a tremendous amount of hype for the film i mean i couldnt go anywhere or do anything without seeing some sort of ad but im very happy to say they met my high expectations and then some firstly the bad stuff the first half of the film is a bit too slowly paced i felt whedon spent a bit too much time on ramp up and origin story especially when each of the important characters had their own origin film for that purpose maybe he felt the need to do so because not everyone wouldve seen the other films but as someone who made the time to see them i felt this was unnecessary once things picked up in the second half it was definitely a worth the wait theres quite a lot lot to love here there are some fantastic action sequences and battles pretty much the whole second half a few moments where you just say that was  awesome a surprisingly frequent number of laugh out loud moments my crowd even had a few spontaneous outbursts of clapping as well the script was very cleverly written and the story was engaging albeit very simple theres something for everyone here its amazing the film was almost 25 hours long because it didnt feel like it dragged slowly paced start withstanding and i felt that whedon did a great job at allowing each character adequate screen time for you to be connected to them this is a rare feet in films where there are so many characters as its very hard to do yet whedon handled this perfectly i didnt feel there was a single character who didnt belong or was just filler see the xmen films every character was necessary every character played a pivotal role every character meant something again cant say enough of how much i appreciated this i loved the performances robert downey jr was once again brilliant as iron man and really is the most interesting character in the film he steals virtually every scene hes in sam jackson puts in a stellar turn once again as nick fury chris hemworth and mark ruffalo were on point as well but the surprise for me was chris evans as captain america i really was disappointed in last summers captain america and i felt he was miscast because he didnt feel as authoritative as i expected captain america to be and not as grizzled or mature but he was clearly much better here as i actually believed him this time around than in the origin film combined with the other performances i really felt this lifted the film be sure to stick around after the credits although really you should have this figured out by now its a marvel staple theres not one but two extra scenes to be seen the 2nd of which is quite hilarious while its not at the level of the dark knight its pretty damn good as a stuff gonna blow up summer film its just a great way to start off the summer movie season hopefully the rest of the summer lives up thishead out to your nearest multiplex get your popcorn ready and enjoy this action gemfor more of my reviews and general movie discussion check out my blog httpandretmsblogspotca,fantasy
this is definitely one to see in theatersthe clashes unworldly displays and explosions are impressive enough but the directors unique presentation through camera angles and gutwrenching motions can only be appreciated on the big screen and with big surround sound speakersjoss whedons philosophical prowess is a perfect match for the comic book genre the moral thread that ties each character together as a team is subtly challenged the clashes between epic characters if considered as a battle between personal philosophies matches the booming fireworks we see on the screenan essential element for tying each character together is to give each character their 15 minutes whedon has a talent for this we are drawn to the less powerful super heroes who arent so fantastic but whom we can relate to from there we eventually relate to and appreciate a demigodit is a spectacle from beginning to end more so near the end,fantasy
my experience part when i saw the trailer for the and was skeptical i loved iron man thor the incredible hulk and even tolerated captain america first avenger this could have easily gone either way because a movie this big had never been done before i walked into the theater for the midnight premiere with 3d glasses in hand not knowing what to expect fast forward to the end i walked out of the theater flabbergasted wearing a grin from ear to ear review the good the certainly earned their name joss whedon was able to do what most cannot he took very different characters from very different universes and brought them all together for one of the best comic book adaptations my eyes have every had the pleasure of watching the story was solid and plausible for what marvel studios has created the cinematography was great especially the 360 shot with all of them in a circle ending with an establishing shot of the group with aliens on the new york skyline and of course who can forget the hulk he stole the show and the motion capture animation was breathtaking the bad god bless him but i was not feeling the captain america suit he stuck out like a sore thumb which was a real shame and the ugly movie ticket prices are a bit too high i wanted to watch this at least 2 or 3 more times after seeing it for a second time,fantasy
when it started getting easier to make superheromovies because budgets became bigger and visual effects became cheaper it became clear that any superheromovie is horrible by nature and only with a good crew and cast would that change the past couple of years havent shown much promise in this area but the shows that with an intelligent and capable director enough good actorsactresses a limit to the amount of deaths and explosions that there can be and a screenplay that at least tries to get away from those nasty clichs there can still be a savetheworldfromdisastormovie that can entertain with its freshness for all superherofans from all walks of life as well as for those wishing to discover what a superherofilm is all about its an allin one bargain,fantasy
flashback to 2008 i was clapping my hands along with many others in a packed theater as the end credits of iron man rolled on the screen but as the credits finished a hush fell over the crowd a new scene played out in which we were introduced to nick fury a collective gasp was let out by those of us in the know when he said the wordfour years and four films later that little tease has become the biggest and best superhero movie of all timeone of the best things about the is that theres no need for an origin thanks to the other films we already know these characters and have seen them in action this allows the filmmakers to get the ball rolling quickly and boy does it ever roll it hits the ground running and doesnt stop until the end but that doesnt mean its just a mindless action movie the character development here is great and the chemistry is amazing you feel their frustration when the group falls apart and share in their triumph when they assemblesimply put its the most entertainment ive gotten out of a film in a very long time seeing those characters together on the big screen spoke directly to the 10 year old in me i cant recommend it enough even if youve never read a comic book in your life you will enjoy this movie,fantasy
the so whats not to like the promised to be the biggest movie of the year that is until the release of the dark night rises it is mix four of the worlds greatest superheroes with three of the worlds best spies and assassins and pit them against an invading army from outer space with some of the best sfx guys in the business and how could you not have the popcorn movie of the year this begs the question how can mere mortals fight along side superheroes the three in question are nick fury samuel l jackson hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson director and writer joss whedon does a fine job incorporating these characters with those who have powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal menis there great acting no doesnt have to be none of the characters calls for it robert downey jr can do the wiseass tony stark in his sleep mark ruffalo does a credible job filling in for edward norton but i keep thinking how much better nortons sneer would have been as bruce banner original reports issued from the hollywood pr machine claimed norton was holding out for too much money and really didnt want the role after the spin died my sources revealed norton very much wanted to be in the film and reprise his role as the hulk the studio cut him out and put out a smear campaign against him making him persona non grata rumors are downey was afraid of being upstaged but i find that hard to believe as downey and norton have both painted the town red with aplomb in the past is there a superior story no the invading army coming through the time warp portal is too reminiscent of masters of the universe i half expected to see frank langella riding one of the space carriages as skeletor the mechanical dragons harken back to the godawful hercules films starring lou ferrigno the original hulk and there are enough continuity errors to scratch your head and cause you to anticipate the extended dvd version which will certainly plug up the holes with deleted scenesand we couldnt have a hollywood movie without putting a bit of an agenda now could we even the epitome of american exceptionalism captain america cites americans as losers and avers the stars and stripes are tarnished this is an obvious ploy to cater to the antiamerican crowd that so loved the comic issue where captain america lost his faith it isnt necessary in this movie and it adds a subplot that is never resolved thankfully nick fury tells cap we need to believe in those things again amen brother amenthe stars of films like the are the techs they do a masterful job that is the sweetest of eyecandies the film is shot in 3d and imax it doesnt need it theres no amazing 3d sequence like there is in wrath of the titans so my advice is save a few bucks and see the movie in a regular theatre with standard projectorsis it big yes is it fun yes especially the scene where loki tries to explain to the hulk he is a god is it a great night out absolutely is it the film of the summer ah no i still think that will be the dark knight risesthe rating for the  a 30,fantasy
as a fan of marvel i have been waiting for a movie of this magnitude for years i am relieved that this movie wasnt released years ago because it would have ruined the hype for this one this movie in terms of visuals directing plot acting is all on point i was a little skeptical with mark ruffalo as edward nortons replacement for the bruce banner character but he did not disappoint there are comedic scenes that are appealing to people of all ages and some scenes are just so jawdropping that you can only hope for whats in store for 2iron man 3 paramount has found a director that can make a billion dollars several times over with the marvel franchise,fantasy
just when you thought star wars movie series was the ultimate must see movie along came harry potter leaving movie goers whats next james cameron avatar 3d this feature will definitely not disappoint the lover of explosive heart pounding hypersonic electrifying larger than life characters and super powered movie nick fury aka samuel l jackson is a perfect fit  shield director  looking forward for additional versions  part 2 part 3 etc  this way the creators can add new characters eg wolverine fantastic 4 etc then marvel fans will get to experience the real future science fiction  its best i am now questioning can joss whedons amazing and constant edge of your seat thriller be topped stay tuneda brilliantly and wonderfully done story line one liners and the history of each super hero if you have the chance and love special effects go see this feature  imax 3d wow enjoy,fantasy
i saw the due to the constant praise and elevated status in the top 250 films of all time when those final credits rolled and the short sequence ended which promises a sequel i was thinking storyline amazing acting amazing action amazing well then why did i sit back with a big meh  every aspect of this film was perfectly executed yet for some reason it lacked that absolute wow factor for me that final touch that makes a good movie into a great movie perhaps it was the constant humour instigated into the story which by the way were hilarious that possibly was overdone and seemed to ruin the movie a bit for me at times it felt like a bit of a joke to me which left me cackling endlessly but evidently shaking my head at how they could do this i just lacked the ability to take this film seriously at times however immediately giving the a 6 or even 510 i realised that it did what it did perfectly and although i didnt get what i wanted out of it and the fact that it didnt live up to my expectations doesnt make it a bad film in fact looking back it was quite the contrary i enjoyed it and it is most likely that you will too if i had of gone into it with an open mind i would of loved it and i intend to do that on my second viewing however i recommend that you definitely see the as it certainly is a good and entertaining film definitely marvels best just enjoy the film and you will laugh and gasp at its perfect execution of action that at times puts cgi to its test i look forward to a sequel and a second viewing of this810,fantasy
i was waiting for this film and was not disappointed my 10 rating does not place it in the same class as the godfather citizen kane et al this is the citizen kane of superhero movieswhen i was a kid my friend and i used to argue about which was better marvel or dc i used to complain that the fought amongst each other too much instead of the justice league of america who fought their foes more harmoniously i think the former is probably more realistic since all these egos on one team cannot work in complete harmony there is a good scene where they are all bickering and challenging each otherthis film is not only actionpacked but there are some very funny scenesmore funny than any of todays supposed comedies the hulk has many comic moments which is ironic since the two hulk films were somewhat disappointingrobert downey jr also has many good lines better than in iron man 2this is a wonderfully entertaining film which is a rarity these days i highly recommend seeing this film also while there are some violent scenes it is more viewable for the kids than the dark knightmy friend was right all along the marvel characters are much more exciting as a team than their dc counterparts although i would love to see a liveaction justice league of america,fantasy
i watched on a special marvel marathon that included all the previous movies in the series i have mixed opinions on the previous single superhero flicks loved iron man hated the sequel cold on hulk hated captain america i can definitely say that this movie far exceeded my expectationsit s hard to define how its charm comes from the subtle the balance of many elements it does not reinvent the comic books and does not pretend to make it a serious version by adding additional cerebral subtexts like nolans batman movies instead it plays by the rules respectfully including all the popular elements of the marvel comics but joss whedon plays his cards both as a screenwriter and as a director with exceptional class first the screen writing is perfect with great pace and great sense of rhythm the movie is full of humor but it is characterdriven and does rely on tired oneliners the characters are developed with such a secure writing that it takes them just a few words to define their types and personalities whedon manages to keep the continuity with the previous movies but also adds his own adult and smart sense of development for instance starks individualism and diffidence is brought to light in a much more developed fashion that in favreaus iron man movies even more impressive is whedons result with the hulk whedon manages to accomplish what ang lee and leterrier failed ie portraying banner as the angered emarginated individual he is and giving angst to his conflict with his alter egowhedons direction also shines through with fantastic touches while respecting the marvel universe movies where skyscrapers need to be smashed and heroes bounce against each other in unreal crashes whedon manages to keep the visuals stunning give realism to the scene while keeping the fun when the helicarrier rises in the movie you can appreciate how whedon manages to make it look imposing without overdoing it when heroes have comic crashes against each other thor and hulk or thor and iron man whedon plays with irony when the crashes are painful captain america during the invasion whedon does make it look painfulthe hero stills smashes through walls and cars with his body but you can feel the pain these differences lay in subtle changes in pace and visuals and whedon really knows how to control each scenes tone with subtlety and craftsmanship recalling the movie i have a hard time not to smile thinking back at how much i enjoyed each scene i am hard pressed to think of a movie that gave me more fun at each level it makes the marvel universe real and tangible without making it look childish more importantly it communicates love for comics and for movies in equal measure if francois truffaut were alive he would have probably found in whedons blockbuster the same love for the capacity of telling a story in a movie that he loved in his favorite filmsi loved this movie and i find it very hard to believe that somebody could hate it,fantasy
movies arent made like this we rarely see something of this magnitude being put in theaters its been over 5 years in the making and the surely lives up to the hypei remember browsing a movie website back in 2007 showing movie info for a movie called the i didnt think to much of it because it said heros such as ant man captain america etc would be in it but i never gave to much thought about it but when iron man came out i was impressed then the incredible hulk came out i was officially hooked on marvel knowing what the could and would be thor and captain american came out and the anticipation that has been kept at bay was time to come the is herenon stop action with a cast that are comfortable with their roles just seeing them all on screen was something we all yearned for after all these years and we finally get it its everything you expect from a great superhero movie all uniting for the same thing teamwork and bravery something we all love to see and done in such a unique way the blend of all these characters couldnt be done any better if youve been waiting for that perfect marvel movie its here,fantasy
well that movie was definitely as great and epic as everyone has been talking about if the movie lacked in anything it gained in its action the only reason i kind of feel disappointed was that i thought thered be more villains besides big and bad loki and what ever he unleashed onto the earth other than that the movie was absolutely terrificthe heroes did seem to play like their normal selves like they were in their separate movies tony stark was still cocky and such a smartass excuse my french or whatever thor still had that meathead mentality old capn was still always ready to help anyone in need and the hulk wasthe hulk this version of the hulk though humored me the most since he always had jokes about why he had to act so cautious the only characters that you really get to fully know more about are nick fury black widow and hawkeye who was my favorite of course the actor who played him sure knows how to be in the roles i just love i did some research before the movie on who the original were and i kept thinking that this one lady who was basically nick furys right hand woman would be wasp but maybe that will be for a later sequelspeaking of sequels there sure will be one judging by the sneak peek i got to see in the middle of the credits sadly i left after that and didnt wait until the end of the credits like a true fan i hope i didnt miss anything great ever since the grey ive always been staying after movies like these which you know would have some huge secret at the end of all the credits all in all this movie was just so beast i totally recommend this movie a thousand times over a million times over if youre a die hard marvel fan id give it a 910 now for a month or so wait until the next big movie i want to see comes out dark knight rises oh man i just cant wait to compare that movie with this,fantasy
the is not an average action flick in fact it is an excellent one the success of this film relies not only on the spectacular visual effects and sustained action sequences but mostly on the characters and the interactions between them iron man captain america thor black widow the hulk and hawkeye are treat to watch as they kick ass exchange clever oneliners and desperately work together to fight off loki and his minions each actor portrays their character with zeal and believability we dont just see robert downey jr sarcastic nature or the ripped biceps of chris evans we see tony starkiron man and captain america saving the world from certain demise as a result we find ourselves cheering them on this is what makes a great super hero flick rdj does get most of the lines but he does not steal the show entirely from the other characters for they have a chance to develop toofor nearly a 2 hour and 30 minute film the flies by the action scenes are not just big explosions and blatant cgi one sequence in particular is reminiscent to the destruction of chicago in transformers dark of the moon but there are several oneonone fights with the super heroes and the villain not trying to give any spoilers but the fight between thor and the hulk is a true visual effects feast and a wellchoreographed sequence some of the action scenes are very long but unlike the last few michael bay films i found myself begging for more the plot is nothing special or too memorable however it is easy to follow anyone who has not seen some of the other action films ex thor captain america iron man will not be confused for the scriptwriters made the a film of its own and not a crossover of the other features it is worth noting that the writers also pack a lot of witty and sometimes unpredictable humor into the mix to sum up the is the best super hero flick i have seen years it has everything i ask for in the genre,fantasy
there comes a time every once in a while when a movie is released to the public that changes everything star wars changed scifi films forever the lord of the rings trilogy redefined fantasy and made it a respectable genre and now we have joss whedons which i can say with assurance that is nothing short of the most entertaining comic book movie ever made and all i can say to my fellow comic book fanboys and girls is this this is the best time to be a comic book geek in historylet me make it clear that this is a spoilerfree review so do not worry about reading further on in case you have not watched the film yet represents the culmination of more than 4 years worth of work and setting up since the release of the first iron man movie back in 2008 and boy does it deliver whedon and co knocked it out of the park without giving too much away the story consists of loki the demigod we saw in last years thor with tom hiddleston reprising the role who has somehow attained an alien army under his command and plans to use it to invade earth obviously shield and agent nick fury played by the alwaysawesome samuel l jackson dont like that so they now must resort to assembling the greatest team to fight this army the world had ever seen and among these individuals are iron man aka tony stark played by the ever entertaining robert downey jr the wwiiera supersoldier captain america aka steve rogers played by chris evans the god of thunder thor played by chris hemsworth and of course everyones favorite brute the hulk aka bruce banner when not the green raging monster played by mark ruffalo who i initially had doubts about his abilities to play a good bruce banner but i assure you and this is coming from a comic book geeks point of view he does not disappoint the question is though will this team of superheroes get along well with each otherwhat i loved the most about this movie is how whedon so masterfully gives each character enough screen time to make them feel essential to the plot and all of them serve an important role one way or another and they all get their own moment to shine even those who doubted that the normal shield agents hawkeye and black widow played by jeremy renner and the oh so attractive scarlett johansson respectively would stand out among the roster of super enhanced heroes would be proved wrong nobody is left out and everybody gives an awesome performance worthy of the characters theyre playingthe screenplay itself also consisted of witty oneliners and is full of hilarious moments i could even go on as far as saying that this movie gave me more laughs than any comedy ive seen in years the humor has perfect timing all around and its used at just the right level to not make the film feel silly the drama is still there but the comedy adds a nice change of pace for when things might start feeling maybe too dramatic for somethe action scenes of course are some of the best ive seen in years the special effects department has really outdone itself in this movie giving us some amazing and thrilling sequences filled with punches explosions arrows bullets laser beams missiles rubble you name it its essentially everything but the kitchen sink just the last 30 minutes alone of this film would be worth paying the admittedly hefty 18 imax3d cost which is the venue that i had the joy of experiencing the film in which brings me to my next point the 3d now i know many people are not fans of 3d and its understandable the movie itself was not shot with 3d cameras such as how avatar but nevertheless i never felt bothered by it during the whole film despite it being a postshooting conversion although i guess you wont still miss much of you see it in 2d either way youll enjoy any of the 2 formatsthere is also a special surprise for the audience about a quarter into the end credits which hints at what possible developments will take place for the next marvel movies following and there is also another scene at the very end of the credits which i also recommend that you stay tuned to watch without giving too much away it is perhaps the most hilarious image of the whole film all in all marvels the is one incredibly entertaining experience which everyone should watch in theaters do not be cheap and decide to watch it in your computer screen watch this movie in a cinema as it is easily the best way to enjoy this wild ride of a film i assure you this is the movie that fans of comic books all around have been waiting their whole lives for the 4 years of hyping up this film have easily paid off and now i cant wait to see what the next chapter of the marvel movieverse will take us,fantasy
last year i had similar reactions to both thor and captain america the first avenger while they were mildly amusing they were often quite boring lacking any bigblockbuster spectacle and seemed only around to lead into another film that film of course was the and not only did i not appreciate a film out to only promote another movie but i had little faith four films with such different styles and backgrounds would come together to work as one film however the film that joss whedon has made completely proved me wrong and exceeded my expectations the may actually be the best marveladaption to be in the vein of the comics its enormously entertaining with witty humor and a satisfying engaging character driven plotwhat makes the film work so well is that the filmmakers of both the and the previous films in the marvel cinematic universe find a way to blend the characters separate mythologies into one arc that feels natural in that sense i have a newfound respect for thor and captain america for how they properly develop their characters individually and establish their own timeline while at the same time developing the background for some of the major plot devices in the while thor and captain america may not work as great entertainment on their own terms when looked at as one huge overlapping arc  which also includes iron man iron man 2 and the incredible hulk  they make for a great serieswhere it seems today the only way a superhero film can be great is if its reenvisioned to be more realistic and dark in the vein of the dark knight or sam raimis spider man series marvels the shows that a great superhero film only needs to satisfy its audience with two solid hours of actionpacked energized entertainment,fantasy
let me just state something from the beginning i had extremely high expectations for this movie and that deeply affected how i viewed this movie i have not seen iron man 2 or all of the incredible hulk before seeing this movie so that may have effected my view as wellalright now to the movie this movie in general has some great parts and some terrible parts the first half of the movie was very slow but understandable because of the need to introduce the characters toward the beginningmiddle of the movie in all honesty i hated it i just felt that it was terrible i didnt understand it at all but the movie went on and things were okay after thatthe characters dialog was very funny at times which had the whole theater laughing tony stark to bruce banner you really have got a lid on it havent you whats your secret mellow jazz bongo drums huge bag of weed for example samuel l jackson did a decent job as nick fury but was not as good as i would have expected from him robert downey jr chris evans jeremy renner and scarlet johansson all gave very good performances chris hemsworth was good but not great as thor but i dont feel he was given enough screen time tom hiddleston was ok as loki but not great the cgi however was very good and the 3d was not very distracting even though at times it did bother mei think the absolute best parts of this film was the action sequences as they were very good but could be better the large action sequence near the end when the alien army attacks is very good but simply could have been much better if it had been extended and more intense explosions were included that would have solved the problemsthe story itself seemed a little thin at times but then again i dont know how it could have been done much differently this movie i see as the superhero equal of the expendables which i felt had great action but a thin story and a cast of superstar actors the entire movie seem a little off to me but that was just me there was no deeper connection like i have with many great filmsin the end i only listed many of the negatives about the movie but there are many good things in the film as well but all and all this is the best marvel movie to date and i cant say im excited about phase 2 of the marvel cinematic universe but well just have to wait and see but like all marvel movies the more you think about them the less you tend to like them,fantasy
this movie was hands down perfect we go to movies like the dark knight to enjoy dark antiheroism and deep meaning then when were in the mood for some good oldfashioned kick butt action and heroism we go see marvel movies i for one love super heroes scifi fantasy you name it im a film buff who loves the fantastic and theres no denying that this movie was fantastic the direction of the action scenes was nothing short of genius they flowed perfectly from hero to hero without even changing the camera the acting was perfect granted some were better than others but there was really no weak link they all had their big moments in the film and they all shined when the time came this summer is a great summer for superheroes and i for one am extremely excited first it was kicked off by the sensational second we have the new take on the amazing spiderman and third we get the finale to my favorite superhero series of all time with the dark knight rises i simply cant stress it enough go see the sit back relax enjoy being part of the crowd enjoy the film and when your donego see it again i know i will,fantasy
im very satisfied with the outcome of this theatrical event the movie has actually succeeded my expectations okay maybe not succeeded but it definitely fulfilled them im sure anyone would agree that this was by far the best of the marvel series there were many laughs which is one of the fine parts of the movie tony stark played by returning robert downey jr had most of the witty lines but he wasnt the only one to bring laughs another fine point of the movie was the action this movie had non stop action dont get me wrong this wasnt just a blow up everything movie it all had reason it had well choreographed fight scenes like the one involving black widow playing by the lovely scarlett johansson and many others involving the loki tom hiddleston was the best villain one could ask for he was menacing enough to take seriously but yet he still managed to be likable the first scene when he comes in is just amazing tom hiddleston obviously just loves show stealing because hes do it again and hulk lets talk about him if theres someone who stood out in this movie its definitely bruce banner played by the first time hulk mark ruffalo he was im sorry but incredible there are some scenes where you just cant help but to cheer for him he is the best hulk ever come on marvel before you give cap and thor another movie why not give him one he had the best scenes in the movie marks acting as bruce was just as good as hulks cgi i could talk about hulk forever but moving on i like the character development i felt like the movie went at the right pace to bring everyone in and it was well timed joss whedon should be proudalso besides the hulk movie i also think they should do some kind of halkeyeblack widow movie they need their own movie to have their whole story told and also theyre cute together plus if you have yet to see this in theaters when you go dont forget to stay for the two extra scenes during and after the credits if you actually read through that thank you thats like the longest movie review ive ever done but i needed to get this out if no one reads this than its whatever,fantasy
i saw this movie today and was a bit confused as to how they would fit all stars in the storyline i would saywowthey did an awesome job a unique movie ive seen were all heroes get placed just perfectly excellent story amazing action and graphics not overdone but just right and keeps you at the edge from the start till end i would recommend this to all but dont watch this in 3d the director has done his best to capture the true characteristics of each marvel hero especially hulk humor has its place in the movie with unbeatable action i gave ten for thislong time since i saw such great direction in a superhero movie,fantasy
ive been watching super hero stuff since i was first introduced to television and i have to say that this is the best super hero anything ive ever seen first the writing was very tight and suspension of disbelief was not a challenge the acting directing and editing were also examples of the best in the genre the movie knew its audience what weve seen what weve experienced and seemed to set out to make a super hero movie that was everything you could want from a super hero movie without being your stereotypical hero movie the are not perfect and even straight edge captain america has his own faults they come together because they have to and they want to mark ruffalo is the best bannerhulk anyone could ask for so if he gets replaced in the next movie the people behind the replacement would be crazy he is what all the hulk movies needed to make the character work both as a person and a monster my biggest quibble with this movie is the same quibble that i had with captain america 2011 and thor 2011 these three movies seem like pg movies on hyped up violence and part of me wonders if they couldnt have been excellent with a pg rating did we need the pg13 violence i think in marvels the level of violence works despite the rest of the plot being rather pg in thor and captain america it cut into the atmospheres of both of those movies but it seemed to work for this movie,fantasy
i came into the fanboyhood of joss whedon late in my life realizing i was a fan of his productions unknowingly i didnt put him and together until recently but after that i was rather in anticipation of it since very much filmed with the same eye for scifi as firefly the continuity of the film had a warmth and familiarity to it that was easy to acceptfirst off it is a fantastic start to the summer blockbuster movies with films like prometheus and batteship also on the horizon i will be probably more critical of what is to come as opposed to what just set the bar with a legion of special effects people and filmed for 3d i believe i did an injustice seeing it in a theater that was doing 2d some of the shots just did not come out the way i think it would have if viewed behind the glasses i saw it in 2d because i am not a huge fan of 3d and all the hype technically it was directed and filmed for 3d and doing a backward compatibility might not have been the best however i do believe that when released as a bluray disk most people would not be able to watch it the production crew may need to tweak it a bit before thensecondly a master hand was at the helm shifting the weight of the film skillfully between cgi action drama and comic relief every artist has the right to interpret a story the way they see it based on characters the moviegoing public have already been introduced to im sure helped but for many only iron man has had the most press hulk seems to have failed captain america did well at the box office but was oddly out of place thor wasnt as well received and his future as well wasnt a forgone conclusion natasha hawkeye nick fury if you didnt really read the comics you just wouldnt have guessed at their place in a movie with so many superegos in it somehow joss managed to extrapolate these vague characters and put them into a solid mix that did not always get along to at the gitgothe story is strong with continuity and weaves a strong relationship between the superheros without haste with a strong beginning the plot is revealed very early but then dwells not so much on the story but the intermixing of the characters to form what the comic book is about the alliance of superheros as a team called the ever been in a band where all the musicians compete for the spotlight but end up just increasing the gain of their amps it is not an easy lesson to learn but it was obvious that iron man was the primary focus meetings indifference competition and cooperation very hard lessons to learn when the world as we know it is at stake but they manage to put aside their egos for the common good and the saving of manhattandamn why is it new york city is always the focus of monstrous plots guess i better not go therenavigating the story there were many points where homage was paid to movies that preceded it obvious was independence day ghostbusters avatar and the likes you had a mix of asian northern euro and american curltures which made for a multifaceted presentation i had a few problems with futureworld design like the waterair ship which staged the initial disharmony of the superheros i will also reiterate my comment about 2d and 3d screen presentationalan sylvestri does a stunning soundtrack which didnt have the usual signature of the initial measure pop as in preceding films it was appropriate though a solid theme was lacking or maybe i just could not get a theme figured out while viewing all the actionone of my biggest surprises was the rewrite of bruce bannerhulk totally unconventional the taught character of the gammaaltered human was harsh intellectual and sometimes more unemotional than his counterpart hulk who really stood out as a serious contender for a relaunch or maybe a new franchise if jeremy renner is open to it the superhero team accepted him and knew how to kindle the huge green giants passion and formed an amazing bond with his peers i would love to see a new hulk movie with this reworked characterjoss has weaved together an amazing story with very few holes and maybe i will see it again but this time in 3d just to see if my observation of the 2d version is correct go see it great action great compassion great story thanks joss,fantasy
brilliant movie simple as a lot of directors can learn from joss whedon  michael bay comes to mind ha ha its a very very funny movie with some great exciting action set pieces 2 words hulk smash can not wait for the inevitable sequel  the rest of the characters solo moviesespecially the hulk the 3d wasnt really the best hence the point dropped with my 910 rating said to my friend before we took our seats to this brilliant movie if thor  the hulk dont get into a scrap im going to be disappointed  the movie did not disappoint excellent throw down between the 2 of them stop reading  go see this movie if you havent already,fantasy
we were able to go as a family and it keeps you really interested right from the beginning it was exciting and really fun it had so many funny parts more recent movies have a lot of one liners that are annoying but this was great people were laughing out loud we of course loved the characters which made the movie even better because of how they set this up to this point i think that was a lot of it they pulled this together from movies we already loved so we didnt have to watch characters develop but got deeper into ones we already knew the audience loved iteveryone clapped at the end and were talking and laughing about it as they were leaving thank you so much for making something we could all see and we will be going again loved it,fantasy
our one great concern about doing this review now is that sending it to imdb at this time may help in causing a crash of the website we had just seen it at a suburban chicago shopping center multiplexand much to our delight we found it to be very much more of a film than had been anticipatedbeing just a little long in the tooth we cam well remember when marvel comics title the first hit the news stands it was in july of 1963 and superheroes were definitely in with their popularity swiftly rising during that periodalthough the genre was probably the most popular one in the comics field from those 23 years before the united states involvement in world war ii beginning a gradual decline in the post war years peacetime brought readers interest in westerns romance movie tieins and funny animals among othersthe great comreback of the cape  mask long underwear characters was due to dc comics updating old favourites the flash green lantern hawkman and to stan lees introducing some new characters thor iron man hulk fantastic four spioderman and bringing back submariner a new human torch and most importantly captain america well now inasmuch as we are now close to being a half century beyond this 4 colour heroes rennaissance it stands to reason that a screen adaptation of the feature would look just a trifle different than a 1960s version we are after all in another century a new millenniumfollowing a series of summer blockbusters marvel productions  paramount pictures have perhaps come up with a blockbuster to end all blockbustersas much as old timers such as yours truly may lament about certain departures from the original wee must admit that if we had our way all the time there would be no progress in any field invention and advancement in medicine would be at a standstill tadio television space travel and mass communications would all be stuck in the doldrums instead of the internet wed probably be using smoke signalsbut still why cant we still see captain america with actual wings on his mask hawkeye wearing his unique mask and thor sporting that viking winged helmet is that asking too much i mean it was okay for loki to model his helmet while sparring with old goldilocks why cant thor also wear his own headgear we suppose that all is due to all of that revisionism that has gradually changed the story over a nearly 50 year period it is almost like dc comics earth oneearth two uiniverse on the much more positive side of things the production team gave us a truly epic story the sort that is on the grand scale of which this certainly deserves it is the cinematic comic book equivalent of those great stories that mr stan lee presented to us all continued for many issuesindeed this may well be the best superhero outing ever since the release of superman the movie in 1978in addition to the outstandingly portioned servings of great fx the film manages to insert a great deal of the humor which stan lee used on the printed page even a sort of self spoofing is in evidence when tony stark ridicules lokis rather stinted speech patterns with the remark so whats this shakespeare in the park all of this begs the question since we now have marvels the as a screen franchise can dc comics justice league of america be far behindnote it was johnny storm of the fantastic four who took over the title of the human torch,fantasy
like everyone else who was anticipating this movie i had heard the massive hype and built up my expectations to the point where let down was all but inevitable and so i went to the midnight first showing hoping for something good but halfready for a bit of disappointment things didnt quite go like that to put it simply the is a triumph of a comic booksuperhero film among fans it will no doubt rank as one of the best marvel based movies to date if not the best its a downright great action film right alongside any blockbuster and a fairly solid adventure filmlets start with the characters acting direction the team here is composed of seven heroes many of which have their own proper films and each of which is played by a very talented actor while this might seem to bode well at first glance it cant be understated how hard it is to balance such strong personalities both the characters and the actors themselves how do you make one movie that basically wants to tell seven stories and where each of those stories basically demands to be center stage its not easy at all you have to fit a lot of pieces correctly and is something which could easily have fallen flat if one of those pieces was offbut joss whedon and cast did a commendable job of balancing all the characters needs together bringing each one fully to life while still allowing the team story to take center stage no one here gets left out everyone has their time in the sun and yet collectively it all fits together to make the movie more than just an ensemble of heroes but the story of an actual team in particular we see very good believable dynamics portrayed with how everyone is assembled then has to adjust to working in a group setting and ultimately become more effective within the then they would be on their own in particular portrayals by robert downey chris evans mark ruffalo all shine in molding the team together iron man is used to going solo the hulk has never been able to be a team player and captain america has a hard time dealing with people who dont really want to follow a group that said it really was all bright spots in the cast and characterization let alone there is never once where the individual portrayal of the actual heroes comes into question they are all spot onthe visuals and effects are of course as good as one would expect top notch all around as good as blockbusters get these days one thing that i did not expect is how funny this movie was there were so many good witty bits here and there i think people were laughing throughout the whole film some moments were outright hilarious which is another thing about this movie it was fun period if you can leave the film critic at home for a moment this movie is escapism at its best its a pure ride of action adventure and fun wrapped up in delicious effects the last half of the movie flows so smoothly its all over before you even know itsome will want to compare this to the dark knight and basically they will criticize it because its not dramatic enough but not every film is a drama not even necessarily every good film is a drama the is not the godfather or dark knight and it was never meant to be but if you can live with that then its a fantastic actionadventure movie right alongside such greats as indiana jones aliens and die hard among fans it is sure to become a classic and again its just wonderful escapism which aside from pixar animated films we dont usually get enough of these days everyone wants to be so serious  its a family film too since theres not much objectionable here overall very highly recommended,fantasy
we all knew joss could would should now its here he did and its awesome the effects the acting the script everything comes together perfectly and with a flow that makes the nearly 3 hour run time zip by i wanted to go see it again fresh out of the theater i do recommend seeing all the preceding films unless you are fully up on your marvel history and even then whedon fans will find themselves enjoying the familiar buffyangelfirefly style patois that defined joss as a voice mark ruffalo as hulk is inspired casting and adds to the film in a big wayjust go see the thing,fantasy
this film is a testament to action  superhero movies as there has never been one like it there is plenty of character development as well as incredible set pieces filled to the brim with exciting action each superhero has a chance to shine as the film progresses and that was something i thought about before seeing this filmironman thor and captain america are a fantastic bunch of superheros with amazing strenghts but the hulk was probably my favorite here as you will see his moments are monumental and add a degree of amazement to the film in my opinion i hope you all enjoy this fantastic film as much as i did 10 stars,fantasy
being a kid that grew up with comics eventually does come down to some basic questions that must be answered who would win in a fight between thor and hulk between hulk and ironman does captain america stand a chance against a god of asgard all these answers have been partially answered through the comic medium however seeing this childhood memory play in front of your eyes and in 3d is quite the eye openerthe is not an origins movie which means a story must be told mr whedon did the super hero genre an immense favor by achieving what almost no one else managed in the last 12 years he filmed a comic book the is a typical marvel story its recipe being the one that kept comics popular for the last 60 years or so bad guy makes move good guys make a stand but fail because they are divided through their loss they understand they must unite and united they winmarvel delivers on all levels it knows that robert downey jr is the movies super star so not only he gets the longest screen time but he also has the funniest lines and proves to be a better man that he believes chris hemsworth is a better thor than last time mark ruffalo steals the show as bruce bannerhulk making this the only worthwhile appearance of the character on celluloid captain america does not quite live up to the challenge but mr whedon knows how to use the character in a valuable way as a result all the scenes between the movies big heroes with big egos are smart funny and keep getting better and betterthe films visualsound effects are magnificent and 3d make this movie an unforgettable experience so do yourself a favor and watch it in a cinema the action scenes are a wonderful cocktail of actionhumor that comes across very successfully as overdramatization in this kind of films usually proves ridiculous marvel was very lucky in making a fantastic ironman movie out of the blue mostly thanks to the talent of robert downey jr while the other three films that introduced the characters were rather average captain america thor hulk 2 this made a lot of people including myself very uncertain about whether the movie would not be the biggest flop of them all i was extremely surprised to see a film that delivers on all levels and is in my opinion the best super hero movie marvel has ever made this is a personal triumph for mr whedon who scripted and directed rather modestly a film that could had failed in so many different ways it is also a great achievement for the production team the allstar cast and the crew who cooperated successfully to manage a very fine balance between action comedy and special effectsif you like comic books this is singlehandedly the best super hero movie since xmen2 and if you like super hero movies it doesnt get better than this,fantasy
absolutely one of the very best films i have ever seen acting directing  script were all top notch well made to perfection and this is what all the comic book fans have been waiting on for years a comic brought to life how it should be done in tradition of marvel comics brilliant film making the is without a doubt action packed but it is also funny clever and serious with innovative cinematography and art direction but its a shame award members will not recognize the film for its movie greatness with a best picture nomination maybe some technical categories thats it other than that trust me and go see it you wont regret it even the nonsuperhero fans will enjoy it,fantasy
ive never been a comic book geek but have seen all the marvel movies thus far the sole exception being iron man 2 and have loved them all until now thor was my favorite simply because i was a huge fan of the otherworldly cinematography the shakespearean dialogue and characters and because i found tom hiddlestons loki to be the most captivating villain in any superhero movie to date so perhaps just as much as seeing the come together i was equally stoked to see loki again as the archnemesis simply put he was fantastic there is a scene when he confronts black widow about halfway through the film that is nothing short of haunting and allows him to show his full range of talents hes brilliantas far as the themselves joss whedon does two things very well here first he allows each character ample time to harness and exhibit its individual conflicts and how they would play out among the team after all putting four superheroes in a room and asking them to play nicely should be no easy task given the massive egos you would expect to be involved whedon plays this collective angst out very nicely second he ties all the story lines from the individual movies together in a near seamless fashion amazingly everything made a good deal of sense as it came together with no major storyline flaws quite the accomplishment given the diversity of many of the stories told in each filmrobert downey is great capturing the cynicism and narcissism of tony stark better than he did in the original captain america and thor bring unexpected humanity to their roles mark ruffalo as the hulk was quite the surprise as he does what eric bana and edward norton failed to do and that is underplay banner rather than portray him as a neurotic hyper fool the best hulk yet scarlett johannsen does a very nice job as black widow also conveying deep emotion and painprobably the best dynamic is between stark and banner two intellectual geeks who form quite a bond that is believablelastly i saw it in imax and that probably added an extra point to my 910 rating as seeing it in a less profound format wouldnt quite capture everything that is on display here all in all definitely worth seeing and ill be back in the theatre again before its on dvd which will certainly be in my collection,fantasy
been waiting for this movie for weeks finally on 4th may 12 the movie is released waited for 4 hours to get the premiere tickets worth the wait no but the satisfaction to be able to watch it on the first day priceless anyway heres what i think of the i cant say that i love it but i dont hate it i just expected a little more out of it there is not much action in the beginning of the movies although the story line flow naturally  builds up later on you dont have to watch iron man captain america or thor to enjoy the movie i rated it 8 because here  there i get a pretty good laugh mostly giggle and of course high points for the excellent movie effects in conclusion its a fun to watch movie  definitely will lighten the mood one of the must see 2012 watchlist if you have the time stick through the end of the credits  check out the next enemy of the ,fantasy
if you are a person for a superhero flick then this would certainly be the one to watch every superhero character is equally and fantastically etched the movie keeps up to the promise with characters being original and behaving exactly how they are taken out from their original places with all the super heroes at one place it creates chaos and one hell of entertainment on a stage where you have all the superheroes together its quite obvious about the target to stop something which causes the end of the world on the other side you cannot expect for a great plot since its all about the heroics of the so have some popcorn and enjoy the movie,fantasy
when we are about to see a movie which has a superhero we automatically associate our expectations but this time weve got six of them so its obvious to expect things from it so this time they have changed the rule book they concentrated on other factors that affects and this time they came up with giving it a comic appearance than comics and boy they came out as winners i didnt remembered any other hollywood movie i laughed out so much and the good thing is its a movie you can enjoy with your family as there are no or negligible vulgarities into itthe movie takes it to the next level of movie making with superheroes the autopsy of movie will destroy your will to read this review my verdict is dont miss it its an adventure of a lifetime,fantasy
marvels or whatever its called in your country is the culmination of the marvel movies that have been released promising a massive teamup between the hulk iron man captain america thor and morethe ambitious film does a decent job of weaving together the various heroes so that it feels like they all serve a purpose in the film it might seem on first glance hard to swallow that a film will find a character like hawkeye as important as thor and one might be afraid the stalwart captain america would be shortchanged by the immensely popular iron man but thankfully the characters are given reasonably equitable amounts of screentimesuperhero films tend to be somewhat predictable but despite the amount of promotional material released thats one thing the film is not im writing a spoilerfree review but all i can say is that when you think you know where the film is headed dr banner and his alter ego manage to mix things upin typical marvel style there are some loose ends and some midpostcredits scenes stick around for the midcredit scene if youre a longtime marvel fan but the endcredit scene adds very little to the experience unless youre extremely hardcorehighly recommended for anyone whos into superhero films for everyone else its an exciting action film but if you havent seen the other marvel films especially thor its going to be hard to follow but just sit back and enjoy the ride,fantasy
i saw the movie in 2d and loved it the summer of 2012 begins with a bang and the rest of the season movies have met their matchmaking the blockbuster the into a masterpiece of entertainment at the time it was announced seemed impossible for me to achieve with such a high level of efficiency and art not even the news of joss whedon directing which im familiar with since his buffy times not even the actors cast not even the most recent trailers could have prepared me for how well this movie is made i already knew it was gonna be good but i wasnt expecting it to be this goodall the actors are at the top of their game i wont stand out anyone lets just say theyre all excellent from the main cast and even the secondary characters like agent coulson or agent hill theyre really good in this and they all get their moments to shine not only individually but as a group i didnt feel that one or the other got more screen time than the others or that one was more important than the rest speaking about the superheroes each had its own relevance contributed to the group and we can clearly feel that when the team finally bonds theyre tough as nails this is a rare feat when dealing with ensemble casts im wondering if any other movie has achieved this level of balance with such a high caliber group of actorsthe script and the dialogs between characters between the or between each one and loki are also spoton its more than obvious the whedon touch who creates a tapestry of living words that sometimes goes beyond the comic book feel of the movie into something more specifically the lines loki delivers and theres no shortage of humor there are laugh out loud moments funny moments that we werent expecting especially one very short scene between thor and hulk that takes but a blink of an eye oh before i forget if the trailers left you with a bitter taste of transformers in your mouth make no mistake the action isnt and by far as robotic tedious and soulless like in those moviesregarding the technical aspects theres not much to tell here ilm delivers as usual and almost like no other the art direction the sound effects the costumes are great alan silvestris score is more than competentin short the reaches without a problem the title of best movie of 2012 so far and it will surely be in many top ten lists when the year is done it is a landmark of cinema and in its particular genre that although different from other movies of the same quality batman begins and the dark knight will absolutely not go unseen by lots and lots of people fans and nonfans and that we will remember like a hulk smash to the head a 2h 20m punch that goes by so fast and that leaves me wanting much more joss whedon had a gigantic task ahead of himself and not only he delivers perfection he may finally get the recognition hes been deserving for years hes become the next great director not to miss welcome to the big league mr whedon when will the 2 be coming out sir910 which may well be a 95 or 10 after a second viewing,fantasy
omg i am shocked how the film turned out i had very high expectations i was waiting for this film for a long timefrom the very begging when it was announced and i was really worried how its going to turn out with so many lead actors i had my doubts about them working together well i can say all my doubts were for nothing this movie turn out to be amazing i still cant believe how great it was acting was perfect all the actors did an amazing job even mark ruffalo i was worried that he is going to play hulk but he did an even better job than eric bana humor was perfect i was laughing through all the movie the effects were astonishing they will take your breath awaythe story was perfect without a flaw all the movies beforethor iron man iron man 2 capatain america hulk incredible hulk are a prequel to this movie and the director did a fantastic job joining themi enjoyed this movie so much that i think this is my best movie of all time,fantasy
im so impressed i will write my first review ever i have seen the movie three times in four days i could watch it until my eyes dried out the most anticipated movie of our generation was a success how often are movies like this never what the fans were promised how often do these movies never live up to the hype i was skeptical of this movie but for some reason i had a feeling this movie wouldnt disappoint  hats off to all the star power the actors played off each other so well i was deeply impressed mark ruffalo did a wonder taking over the bruce banner rolewhen ed norton left i wasnt happy howeverruffalo did well i want too see him repraise the role i dont want to say much more it was great movie defiantly will be in my top 3 of all time and i hope it once it comes to dvd i will own said movietill next time keep it marvel,fantasy
i have registered to imdb only to comment on this movie and when i start typing i realize that i have no words to describe how happy i am to have made such a row that i have had at 6 pm to go to see her at 10 i went to see the movie with my wife a friend my sister my parents and i even took my grandmother maybe she slept a little but the rest of us were quite amazed maybe 2 points can summarize some of my impressions 1 it has everything dialog action effects plot satisfying ending and yet an open one  2 you cant miss this one i think that the best way you can understand all the reviews including this one is going by yourself and enjoy surely if you have been before in imdb youll notice that there arent a lot of movies that overall more than 8 so maybe something of truth is there in my words,fantasy
pumped excited mighty happy and satisfied these are just some of the feelings i got right after watching this incredible movie driving home from the cinema talking about it commenting are favorite parts while storm is brewing over us it was like thor himself was watching proud of work that he and his superhero friends have done this is much more than a summer blockbuster much more than a popcorn flick this movie has a point it is the culmination of everything that happened from iron man through captain america it starts with a bang it ends with it its action packed funny and will keep your eyes glued to the screen for 143 minutes special effects are topnotch beautiful simply incredible and if you choose to watch the movie in imax 3d youre going to shake in your seat but effects are just that this movie features an amazing cast they fit together so nicely everyone got just enough of screen time everyones motives explained many will again say this is not that much of an art its just a lot of explosions and fights between superheroes but it is so much more you just have to see it to believe it me being sort of a geek waiting patiently for this master piece since it was first announced and since nick fury first appeared in the post credit scene i got what i hoped for this is a mustwatch,fantasy
in the movie the i saw thor on the title of the movie before i heard of the movie i watched the movie thor and i really liked the movie spoiler here for the movie thor in the ending of thor he destroyed a bridge that connected to a pad and with that pad you could travel to different locations like earth there is only 1 travel pad in the movie so my question is how can thor be in the movie when it clearly showed him destroy the bridge near the end of the movie to save his city please tell me how this is possible if you have not watched the movie thor i would really recommend watching it it is a really good movie they did a good job on itthanks,fantasy
wow ive just seen this film in the cinemas and i am blown away this is easily one of the best superhero film i have seen it has everything you would want great action good acting superb specialeffects and extremely good interaction between the characters i wont give anything away but the interaction between the hulk and thor is hilarious especially near to the end of the film chris evans is great as captain america mark ruffalo is good as the calm hulk chris hemsworth is good as thor yet again the rest are decent but the star of the characters is robert downey jr as tony stark he is such a smart witty funny character and he makes the film a lot more interesting my only fault with acting is that loki is not bad enough the actions scenes in the film are really intense and the effects are amazing and realistic if you include flying robots overall the film is fun from start to finish its good for all ages and is easy to understand,fantasy
what can i say you have to see this movie some of the best action i have ever seen on the big screen it didnt suffer from american cheese in the way that i though it might and it had a solid plot loved it absolutely loved it from the outset this movie captures your imagination and attention all the previous movies come together perfectly fury is a great character and samuel plays the part well thor is easily as convincing as he was in his debut movie and robert downey jr plays a great stark there is just the right amount of humour and just the right amount of quiet moments just letting you catch your breath before the next visually stunning action spectacular since i was a kid i havent wanted to be a super hero but right now i want to be an avenger,fantasy
note this review has been rewritten to say my changed opinion of this movie as of 5012013however this movie is overrated at least in my opinion the prequels with iron man and the incredible hulk when i was 12 actually got me into comic books i also adore joss whedons tv work and his previous movie serenity which is my favourite movie the movie is fun for a summer blockbuster but there isnt really that much morepeople here talk about how amazing the character development is well i guess phil coulson had a larger fan base than i thought because whedon used his trait of killing off characters we care about which if you look at his tv work it has been done so much better so many times before i still have yet to watch dollhouse but based on buffy angel and serenity it has been done much betterthere isnt really much point to black widow of which should be recast and hawkeye being on the team in a team of gods supersoldiers anger issues to say the least and the most advanced weaponary made up into suits of armor there really isnt much point to just 2 spys one using a bow and arrow of all thingsonto what i rather enjoyed tom hiddlestons performance as loki is rather well done the plot was decent for what it was  an alien invasion flick how many times have crappy plot lines dominated that and the movie was entertaining enough to not feel like a movie thats nearly 2  hours long so the movie is pure entertainment but its really nothing groundbreaking so really dont go in expecting anything other than a shallow chaotic plot that is rather well executed in terms of entertainment the people calling this the greatest movie of all time do get tiring to read,fantasy
starring robert downey jr samuel l jackson mark ruffalo scarlett johansson jeremy renner chris hemsworth and chris evans directed by joss whedon 140 minutes opens midnight thursday at major theaters pg agent phil coulson will love the you surely will too if you recognize his name officious but lovable shield sleuth phil is one of many marvel comics minions joss whedon summons to his energizing superhero adventure making this first blockbuster of summer 2012 something of a geek drill it helps if you go to the film having already seen the two iron man movies plus thor the incredible hulk and captain america the first avenger all released between 200811 and leading up to this ensemble nerdgasm but you dont have to sport a propeller beanie to enjoy the and this may be the highest possible praise for what director whedon and his cowriter zak penn have wrought theyve cannily crafted a saga guaranteed to pass muster with the comic con cognoscenti without forsaking regular popcorn munchers who just hope to see the planet get saved with maximum firepower and a few laughs whether you love or merely like the it will likely all come down to the performances and not the perfunctory plot or the onthefly back story you dont need to know agent phils connection to the marvel multi verse to appreciate clark greggs expanded and surprisingly emotive take on him here as a combination of fusspot and fan boy and past knowledge of two iffy hulk movies isnt required to marvel at the nuances that newcomer mark ruffalo brings to the greenskinned beast even though the other guy within mildmannered dr bruce banner isnt revealed until the 80minute mark of this 140minute bladder testalso new to the team and the evolving narrative are scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff aka black widow a lethal gymnast who demonstrates early on that a chair makes a dandy weapon and jeremy renner as special agent clint barton aka hawkeye whose arrows arent quite the robin hood anachronism they appear to be robert downey jr returns in fine scathing form as billionaire playboy tony stark aka iron man the ferrous phenomenon who shields everything except his sharp tongue its pretty much business as usual meanwhile for the two most dislocated chris hemsworths thor a norse god fallen from the heavens and chris evans steve rogers aka captain america a second world war super soldier still shaking off decades of deep freeze and culture shock theyve all been brought together by eyepatched persuader nick fury samuel l jackson the director of shield a global version of the us department of homeland security its sort of a team stark glibly says of the and sort of is the operative phrase for much of the movie,fantasy
after reading mixed reviews about this film i decided to give it a try with both digital 3d and dbox as addons let me say that i was certainly not disappointed though the storyline in itself does not bring anything new to the game i have to say that i have not been this entertained by a movie for a long time firstly the cgi was best in class the characters including the hulk were lifelike and believable i remember thinking before the movie started lets see what a 200 million movie looks like and the results are more than impressivein regards to the 3d yes there are some darks scenes where there is no real sense of depth however the final scene in nyc alone is worth paying the 3d premium for flying through the manhattan skyline dodging explosions and twistandturning in wrecked cars were some of many scenes that make you feel like you are actually there this must have been helped by the dbox chairs which i would also recommend to make this experience completefinally the actors all did a great job both in hilarious oneliners as well more emotional sequences overall i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the cinema experience for the thrills as this title will not fail in keeping you on the edge of your seat,fantasy
hands down this is the best film the genre has ever producedall too infrequently a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot then theres the rare beauty that hits above the mark the is such a movie it exceeds the already high expectations its the best big budget movie that ive ever seen it honestly may be my favorite movie of alltime it hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot breathtaking action sequences charisma crisp and witty dialogue the perfect villain actual character development and puts it all together in one amazing package for those few out there that didnt have high expectations this movie will surprise you with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun the inner turmoil within each character as well as the outer friction between such diverse individuals worked exceptionally well we really can relate to each character and why he or she feels and acts the way that they do rest assured that the does delivers on every level and does so with great emotional momentsits a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated and will continue to generate now that people are seeing it and falling in love with it completely,fantasy

i cant say that i was that keen to see this movie even with joss whedons name attached to it  a man who has had a career in reverse with his buffy the vampire tv series coming across as the culmination of a career in the industry whilst other tv series of his that ive seen not reaching those heights  but the good reviews for the film made me change my mind this is a movie which is as superhero movies should bea rollicking spectacle generally im pretty selective about what superhero movies i watch havent seen the captain america outing asim not americanjingoism doesnt sit well with me also i tend to jump off a franchise pretty quickly tooiron man 2 was soso so i probably wont watch the next instalment it will be interesting to see if this series can maintain the levels of the original there were plenty of laugh out loud moments for me in it i did see thor due to some amusing clips in a movie review tv showbut the clips showed the funniest bitsand they werent as funny in the context of the movie no doubt joss whedons time on buffy the vampire slayer was invaluable in crafting the kind of comedy that works so well in this moviehopefully the runaway success of this movie may see joss given the chance to make a sequel to serenityi want to see what that kickarse chick is capable ofi think the actress name is summer glauim not sure if whedon has an intention to make a sequel to that movie which was based on his okay tv series fireflyanyway the plot concerns thors younger brother loki obtaining a device which can see him seize control of the earth via an unholy alliance with some ugly looking villainsand its not clear who has the better end of that particular bargain one of the biggest laughs i got was with thors comment about his relationship with loki after a comrade of his lists lokis achievements nick fury has to assemble a team of superheroes in order to tackle lokis alliesand there are some heavy hittersthe hulk iron man captain americathen a guy and a chickif you dont lump captain america in with the b team the fight with lokis allies  when it comes  is impressive it was after finding some blockbuster franchises became hohum for me that i got a real kick out of the new wave of superhero movieslike hancock and kickass they were the perfect antidote to when blockbuster sequels were merely lame attempts to cash in on a superior original time will tell if the falls into the same trapand if it does its a pity that chlo moretz is now too old to have that same wonderful impact that she did as hitgirl in kickass anyway if joss is onboard for the sequels to this film im onboardfor at least one more timei saw this movie in 3d in xtreme screen didnt find the 3d particularly spectacularparts of the movie are in regular 2d toojust by the byim not that familiar with norse mythology or whathaveyoubut i do find thors hammer rather lame in an amusing kind of wayits sort of like his handbag or something is it louis vuittonlastlythis movie being called the when i heard the name i was expecting it to be about steed and purdie or steed and emma peelif i was older,fantasy
got to see a sneak preview tonight in 3d it really does have everything a great action movie needs the story was good lots of kudos to the director joss for making it an amazing movie there were moments of intense action scenes of sharp humor and each character got to show their strength in a very good way  and not just the physical portion of it i cant wait to watch it again to see everything i didnt catch the first time this will hopefully blow away the critics of the comic book genre and make new fans  it really brought a lot of what the is to the screen cant wait to see whats next,fantasy
a marvelous marvel from marvel the is a worth watching flick and it belongs to every age group a grandfather will enjoy this movie as much his grandson willcast  everybody is looking very nice in their respective uniforms but mark ruffelo as hulk jermey runner as the hawk tom hiddleston as loki are outstandingstory  is about ok cant expect much on the story side as this is the first movie and it is mainly concentrated on assembling an average highly predictable but enjoyable storylinedirection  joss whedon has put a lot to make a weak storyline work he is brilliantlikes  action of the movie is really nice but it doesnt take actions to a new level we have seen better action sequences already comedy with minimal scoperobert downey jr and hulk does make you laugh at some points great vfx climax  unlikes  it lacks on the emotional frontas there is only 1 girl among 5 hunks its pretty obvious as well,fantasy
for we superhero fans this movie has been long time coming but the end result largely justifies the wait weve had two iron man outings and separate films highlighting captain america thor and the hulk now these four  plus the lesser known hawkeye and black widow are assembled by shield to combat thors evil brother loki whom we have seen before balancing so many larger than life characters and featuring so many special skills must have presented a mega challenge but director joss whedon  who gave us another ensemble piece in the underrated serenity  has done a skillful job and as cowriter he has crafted a sharp script with plenty of wry humourno viewer will doubt that british actor tom hiddleston makes a wonderful super villain but opinions might differ on who makes the best super hero all six candidates  robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo jeremy renner and scarlett johansson  give fine performances and bounce well off one another in the early competitive phases but for me downey jr is still the ace in the packthere is plenty of action and excitement and the special effects are well done although it might make a change for a city other than new york to be smashed up and in the 3d version i saw the extra dimension only really worked in the final titanic battle,fantasy
i was skeptic about the very few heroes movies have deserved good critics but i must admit the film is great great action amazing special effects and a script that goes straight to what we expect action and fights the kind of things we expect from super heroes while transformers really sucked because of spending a lot of time on stupid romancing and forced jokes the succeed on providing intelligent funny scenes even in the middle of war that being said ive seen some comparisons between and dark knight sorry to say but dark knight is miles away and that being said by a guy who just liked marvel comicsnow the bad partthis movie has confirmed my feelings3d definitely adds nothing but a discomfort to the movies ive gone to the imax 3d just to be sure my issue with 3d werent the theater no good you cant barely notice 3d ive seen inception on imax 2d it was amazing after leaving the i really desired i had seen the 2d versionafter all the fact that 3d sucks so much doesnt reduce the fact that if youre looking for fun the will provide you a lot,fantasy

anzac day public holiday late night session not an empty seat in the house the atmosphere was at a deserved premium for the years most anticipated film and the did not disappoint the king of scifi television director joss whedon buffy firefly enlists the help of one samuel l jackson in assembling earths mightiest heroes to protect humanity against the greatest threat to our existence in history sounds pretty stockstandard right it should because the makes no move towards trying to reinvent the genre but rather takes everything that makes a film like this enjoyable and cranks it to eleven proving theres some life in the blockbuster yetall is peaceful on planet earth with the allpowerful cosmic cube safely in the hands of nick fury and shield that is until loki thors evil halfbrother from another realm storms the castle and commits larceny of the grandest scale his actions convince fury that the world is indeed at war and he is left with no choice but to reinstate the initiative with it he brings together the hulk captain america thor hawkeye and the big cheese iron man to take down this mighty foe unfortunately all signs point to the superheroes killing each other before saving the earth cause you know prioritiesthe films unquestioned drawcard has always been its ensemble cast and more importantly the potential for spectacular chemistry between the leads this forced sceptics to beg the question how long will this gimmick last before everyone starts to get in each others way the final product allays such concerns with ease as whedon his fellow writers and the actors all deserve equal credit for their depiction of the superteam as the ultimate dysfunctional family to the mere mortal a superhero can appear angelically honourable and beyond reproach throw four of five of them into one room and they become stubborn irritable and deviously arrogant just like the rest of us watching this dynamic progressively unfold throughout the film is a treat as the bicker over almost anything all with a watchmeproveimbetterthanyou macho attitude a witty script almost entirely devoid of clichs that allows room for sufficient individual character development certainly helps this dynamism stark copes with fighting for something greater than himself for once banner draws sympathy as a brilliant mind struggling with a crippling case of split personality and the contrasting ideas thor and loki possess regarding freedom arguably the films most prominent theme all contribute to the films depth without disrupting the excellent pacingwalking into this film in the right frame of mind one would find most minor flaws few and far between not every oneliner or scripted joke hits the mark in typical marvel fashion and cobie smulders character comes off as underused and unnecessary in stark contrast no pun intended to her prominence in the trailers kudos must also go to the execution of the megascene that is the fortyminute climactic battle between the and lokis army while it is certainly nothing new the megascene has become more and more of a staple in major action franchises of late including the last harry potter and transformers films the ambitious nature of the set piece by sheer design means things can get ugly and repetitive in a hurry if care is not taken to ensure the audience is engaged at all times see dark of the moon with the though the final act is not only visually fascinating but also mentally stimulating constantly jumping between various settings and characters involved with new developments occurring every couple of minutes to ensure one doesnt even come close to losing interest after a string of commercially dominant but critically indifferent projects it appears marvel has finally hit the jackpot in every sense of the wordtheres nothing i love more than a bit of feedback good or bad so drop me a line on jnatsisiprimuscomau and let me know what you thought of my review if youre looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication id also love to hear from you,fantasy
following the success of iron man 2008 marvel comics came up with the idea of putting all superheroes together in the a sequel to iron man and films like thor also played their part in building excitement in the run up to the films release its biggest star robert downey jr reprises his role as tony stark ironman and has scarlett johansson as natalia romanoff black widow who had a role in iron man 2 for company theres gwyneth paltrow in a brief role as pepper potts also from the marvel universe theres chris hemsworth as thor tom hiddleston as his brother the villain loki samuel l jackson as nick fury director of shield chris evans as steve rogers  captain america mark ruffalo as dr bruce banner  hulk and jeremy renner as clint barton  hawkeye are the other first billed actors the story starts at a secret facility where scientists are researching on an unknown energy source the tesseract then things go awry and a portal is opened up allowing norse god loki to come through and evil loki plans to use the power source team up with an alien race called the chitauri and subjugate earth with the world on the verge of falling apart nick fury can only rely on his superheroes to save the world but getting these larger than life characters with massive egos to work together proves to be tougher than it seems the rest of the story plays on the good vs bad theme replete with action stunts and cool gadgets the films selling point is not its theme but the way they go about telling the story for one it doesnt have heroes coming together spontaneously making speeches about good and bad and then going all out battling the bad guy here they are shown to have their own issues and obviously issues with one another the altercation between characters gives us some really nice oneliners one of my favorites was when captain america asks tony stark ironman big man in a suit of armor take that away what are you to which stark responds uh genius billionaire playboy philanthropist with his usual arrogance the is also a visual treat filmed on digital media it was converted to 3d in post production and was digitally remastered to imax format the special effects are state of the art and offer edge of the seat action although i watched it on a regular screen with 3d it would definitely be worthwhile on imax since it is based on a comicbook theme and superhero theme there are those who may choose to skip on the pretext that comics are just for kids ah get over this idea and let the overwhelm you with its action and fantasy,fantasy
so after months of waiting for it and getting some excellent reviews about it i finally went to see the at the movie theatres and here is how i felt it wasexciting visually mesmerizing and very well acted and directed the is superb to any movie lover and is full entertainment from the start and the brilliant visual effects the great acting by the whole cast who really justify their characters and some great direction by joss whedon just makes it even better and worth the watch and great entertainment throughout the watchthe story which is quite reknown is based on the comics named as the same with the 6 superheros coming together to make an alliance and defeat the villain loki the brother of thor whos mission is to rule the whole world and with some help of his alien friends he gets very powerful to really test the the acting by the whole cast is quite superb and every person have done their character justice by portraying these superheros very well but i thought robert downey jr as iron man jeremy renner as hawkeye and tom hiddleton as loki really took the cake as they were quite excellent in portraying their characters robert downey was his quite arrogent self as the iron man renner again gives a powerful performance as the hawkeye and tom hiddleton is really good and cunning enemy who is also quite influential and powerful the humour by the characters are also quite good and it really doesnt let the movie go blandthe direction by joss whedon in this movie is quite superb as he has done a convincing job in making one of the best 3d movies in the past year with excellent 3d effects great acting by each and everyone in the cast which he helped in and the shots taken in the moviespecially in the last battle in manhatten are really breathtaking and for that the cinematographer seamus mcgarvey also deserves his due credit for giving us such breathtaking scenes but whedon has really made one of the best visually enthralling and one of the better superhero movies of all time he doesnt let the movie go bland or boring by keeping the humour coming in and with fight scenes in good times he really has entertained the audiencethe story of course which is known by many comic fans is quite great and the screenwriter who is also joss whedon and the derivers from the comics whedon and zak penn have taken an interesting and gripping story which has ensure in entertaining the audience throughout the movie and really keeping you at the edge of your seat the visual effects and the 3d effects as i said earlier are quite simply superb and one of the better 3d movies of the past year and the 3d effects in all of the fighting scenes are really breathtaking and hats off to the visual team for doing such a great job with the visual effects which make this movie so good the music of the movie is quite good too and really sets the tone in the atmosphere of the movie and i really liked the background score so music director alan silvestri also deserves his due credit for his contribution towards this movie and the contribution by each staff really needs appreciationthis movie really deserves a watch by anyone who likes entertaining movies and really deserves to be seen in 3d and this is one of the better superhero and 3d movies of the past time and this really is a bright sign to the great summer blockbusters to come in the near future810,fantasy
awesome is another word that should be in the title joss whedon did the business with this film please do not do another as it will ruin a spectacular first outingnah im kidding roll on the next one plenty of action and laughs throughout the entire film make sure you stay past the initial credits for the extra scene which was no surprise when you have watched a few marvel films all the cast have plenty of on screen time and they did milk a scene and rightly so during about 23 in when the destroyer weapon is usedfunniest bits were with the hulk mainly punching peopleyah violence,fantasy
when i first heard of the idea to actually produce an film i was of course intrigued as the idea of making a superteam movie had never been accomplished before but the marvel universe films had all been cleverly interconnected and the stage was ripe for the to be made naturally in a film with so many a list actors so many heros and so many egos the potential for disappointment was vast but im happy to say the was thoroughly enjoyable the script is funny the action comes thick and fast and is choreographed much better than in any of the other marvel films and all the things you liked or cared about the characters before has been carried on a very enjoyable summer movie easily living up to the weight of expectation,fantasy
i had a chance to watch the on friday night and got to say the movie was way better than i expectedi didnt had much expectations for this movie because last couple of times i expected some movies to rock but they all let me downlets say transformers iiiyeahthe acting was awesome and the special effectsone of the best i have seen in the recent timesand of course the 3d was great tooit guarantees you a fast paced action from the beginning to the endthe movie is successful in every wayin terms of story telling and cgi action was awesome as it gets in every senseif you are looking for a great movie that u are planning to watch it in the cinemasthen dont wait the is just what u r looking for ,fantasy
im not sure what everyone else thought about this film i was worried really worried it just seemed that the studio was rushing it throughi watched it as soon as it came out before i had even read any reviews and i have to say that so far its in my top 5 films of the year easilyjoss whedon has done a fantastic job each avenger is given a good amount of time on screen with iron man having the lions share the dialogue is snappy and all the actors do a great job with the script mark ruffalo does a superb turn as dr banner as does tom hiddlestone as loki who clearly likes being the bad guy in fact there is not one thing i could say is wrong with this filmthere are a few good laughs in this as well 2 of the best come from the hulk i wont spoil it for you but one of them i actually laughed out loud on and i very rarely laugh out loud in the cinemaoverall this is a fantastic film one that you could watch even if you only had a small understanding of the marvel universe if like me though you are a marvel fan and read the comics you will enjoy all the subtle references in the film as well as all the actiongo see it you wont regret it,fantasy
putting thor hulk captain america and iron man all into one film was never going to be easy what with diehard fans of certain characters demanding they each have their moment to shine however joss whedon succeeds in creating such a balanced film with a huge cast he makes it look effortless assember the take your pick is one of the best films of the year and it hard to think of any other director who could have pulled it off sure there are many other great directors out there but whedon ensures that you dont to have of read the comics to appreciate this the cast direction the script the editing very smooth cgi cinematography etc is amazing but im sure this has already been a lot mentioned about it what made the film for me personally is the sense of camaraderie between all the characters as they work together that is essential in any war team film that depicts people working together each character is also nicely developed particularly bruce banner aka hulk supporting members including nick fury hawkeye and black widow are also given their time to shine and each actor is well cast while lokis motif could have seen a little more development the film feels nicely rounded and the action is amazing to watch as new york is torn apart the film is funny in places but never feels goofy or unnecessary pay attention michael bay whedons ability to keep the action fresh ensures that this film never falters and becomes tired assemble is an amazing film that gives the audience what they want and more and is a sure contender for the best superhero film to date while the dark knight rises comes closer to its release it is important to note that these are two very different films regardless there is something for everyone and i strongly recommend watching it on the big screen,fantasy
even though i am not a passionate reader of american comic books  i really enjoyed this movie this film succeeded to penetrate my firewall and planted a strong desire to master all the hero comic booksthe movie has a long running time of 142 min not to mention of it the director needed long enough to provide appropriate conflicts to the respective avenger members the first half of the movie shows members conflict whereas the second half shows their reconciliation and reunionthat is also a good example of how the members cooperate in such as desperate situation the earth is under siege thanks to perfect cg and perfect acting of heroesheroines this movie is almost gave me joy of listening to a well made classical symphony the last 30 min of war scene is outstanding and memorial marble comics did it really this is a phenomena,fantasy
i brag about movies being good all the time but rarely when i believe they are great im a fan of all genres of movies but lately i have felt a bond to grow with superhero movies because they keep getting better it seems hollywood finally listened to regular common people that pay to watch the movies they produce it has been a while since i walked out of a movie theater with a sense of satisfaction and today was no exception i live in el paso texas but today i crossed the borderlegally of course to juarez to watch the movie i know i am still a little immature at my age35 on some things of course but sitting at the movie theater i felt like a kid again happy excited and with a smile from cheek to cheek when it was over i am a geek regarding comic books superhero movies and stuff heck my favorite toy and item of collection is my wolverine 1 in nearmint condition lol but seriously this is a movie to see more than once in movie theaters specially in 3d then purchase it on bluray when it comes out because it will be one of those movies that you can watch over and over i am very happy this movie was made every other superhero movie that comes out after this has to be spectacular near perfect because this movie just raised the bar for the genre good job and thanks to everyone involved in creating this awesome production go watch it take your kids nephews grandkids your entire family or even just yourself you will not regret it ,fantasy
before the assembled weve had 2 iron man 2 hulk 1 thor  1 captain america movies black widow was seen in iron man 2 and hawk eye makes a first time appearance in this one if you do the math it is pretty clear that to get the right the director has to get hulk and iron man right iron man is safe in the good command of robert downey jr but hulk was the only character that never peaked in spite of two actors eric bana  edward norton trying to nail it in two different movies for me the biggest triumph of the is mark ruffalo as bruce banner the hulk he is the best hulk yetwhats it about for those who have not followed the series loki tom hiddleston brother of thor chris hemsworth lands up on earth searching for a cube that will help him rule the earth nick fury samuel l jackson has to stop him so he assembles iron man robert downey jr the hulk mark rufalo black widow scarlett johanson hawk eye jeremy renner captain america steve rogers and thor chris hemsworth to stop loki how is it paisa vasool entertainmentmy take like i mentioned above mark ruffalo as bruce banner the hulk is the bestest part of the movie you have to be patient enough for the hulk to appear his entry is almost after an hour but mark ruffalo prepares the perfect build up as bruce banner with his restrained and almost vulnerable portrayal of a character struggling with his condition the second best thing is the humor joss whedon gives all the characters some really witty lines to deliver since most part is about the coming together the humor helps in keeping the audience engaged especially those who are not well versed with the back stories of each individual superhero out of the all the superheroes i was only interested in robert downey jr and mark rufalo the rest were great supporting actors at their best the icing on the cake is the last 30 mins when the film peaks as a special effects loaded summer blockbuster movie if you look at director joss whedons filmography youll wonder what made the studios trust him with a rumored 220 million dollar budget film now that is the story i am very interested in knowing he is the only guy i know who has taken a giant leap from tv to the big screen word of mouth the is an ultimate 2 super hero the hulk and iron man movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 black widow hawk eye thor and captain america rating   very good ticket meter worth any amount of moneyps if you have it playing in an imax theatre drop everything and make an effort to watch it there the fun just multiplies with the imax experience,fantasy
well for years marvel studios have been building up to this movie teasing the fans and providing a lot of solid entertainment flicks along the way so does it live up to expectations well for me at least it certainly does the movie is often jawdropping exciting funny and full of those fan boy moments weve all dreamt about thor vs the hulk you got it thor vs iron man yep present and correctthe actors all do well and have many moments to shine but robert downey jrs tony stark gets a lot of the best lines while scarlett johanssens black widow gets a surprising depth to her character director joss whedon has skilfully avoided the iron man and the other guys movie this could have been  is a true ensemble piece with a script that skilfully blends the various heroes backgrounds and personalities whedon has scored big timeboy do you really feel the power of the hulk and thor  this is on a different scale to those characters solo movies mark ruffalo is easily the best bruce banner ever and the jolly green giant has never been so awesome and theres a surprising amount of screentime for some of the lesser characters  jeremy renners hawkeyes is great and fan fave clark greggs agent coulson is again top notchwith all the awesome mayhem going on poor ol steve rogers must feel mightily underpowered when up against the thundergod ol greenskin and the golden avenger yet capt america gets some good moments too tom hiddlestone is again excellent as loki  a bad guy with some weight always makes these movies work better his confrontation with the hulk is a sheer joy the sort of thing which smacks you full in the face and makes you laugh out loudmy only gripe is the central plot idea marvel themselves must have used it a hundred times at least in their comics and if youre gonna do an alien invasion story why not use the skrulls or the kree  better known aliens what you do get is a spectacular battle for new york between the and the aliens the latter are just cannon fodder but its terrific stupendous stuff if you want brooding introspection go to the dark knight want wham bam kapow go here,fantasy
the movie is awesome 2 and a half hours non stop action and story twists the main thing is the movie when the fight comes i wont that to stop i want it to continue it is done in such a graphics and design looks real and superb even on watching the avatar movie i dont experience this much fun and acceleration this movie is meant for non stop action acceleration the climax is good i felt sorry that the movie is over bcoz i dont want to miss the super heroes even my family too everybody from the age of 1 to anything it is will love to watch the super heroes performing a splendid action to save the world if you are not watching this movie you are going to something in your life which is a world wonder project i would say i will give it endless points if i can for making me to forget who am i for the 2 and a half hours enjoy guys see you in the next,fantasy
a must watch for may  this movie definitely keeps the style of iron man  lots of funny lines excitement quick peace line and mouthdropping hightechnology weapons wellwritten dialogue loaded with entertainment message and clue some lines make you laugh spontaneously  but when you think them twice will reveal the value of each charactereg awe need a plan of attack b i got a plan attackthe plot is very 3d  it welldepicted the role character and struggle of each hero to make you hardly dispense anyone of them in the movie say i cannot imagine how this movie will looks like if your take the hulk away not to mention iron manin short i never check my watch during the play as every second is so breathtaking currently it is the first runner up on my comic hero movie list just after batman the villain and the inspiring quote of batman is unparalleled,fantasy
ok so this is my first review ive done so sorry if it isnt grade a standardill start off by saying before you see this movie make sure you watch the movies that lead up to the it doesnt take away from the experience but youll get to know the characters better and add depth to them all the 3d nothing special maybe one part that did it well but other then that just your usual converted 3d the characters were good tom hiddleston my opinion out shines them all except for robert downey jnr but maybe its because im a big fan of robert and mark ruffalo performed well there is some good comedy in there even during the final battle one problem i had though was with captain america suit i know its part of him and from the comics but i felt like i couldnt take him seriously and by the end of it hulk didnt feel like hulk i would explain but i feel like it would spoil things that being said though i still enjoyed the movie please take into concern this is my opinion dont take it seriously people like different things thank you for your time,fantasy
i guess you could call this the staple of the whole marvel universe from what ive heard and seen it sounds like most of the teasers and connections from the subsequent films come together in this collective movie it was bound to make a lot of money at the time of its release but the people in charge seemed to take a lot of care with the other movies and create enough of a backstory so that the movie functioned like a sequel but not so much that you were lost if you didnt see the other movies they had a very big budget to work with but i think they spent their money well and it resulted in a pretty hq movie that doesnt necessarily mean it will please everyone though it certainly tries to but you can clearly see that there was a lot of work and time and stuff that went into the two hours we all spent at the theaterthe story is mostly character driven the plot is mostly directed by lokis plan of world domination and disbanding the and this is what youll probably pay the most attention to on your first viewing there are lots of subplots involving each of the heroes different problems and much of this involves background information from the previous movies the thread involving the trying to come together is quite prominent but its harder to focus on it the first time around because youre probably concentrating more on lokis scheme the way loki uses their volatility and power against each other is great and the dialogue in those scenes of tension is very well written to top off this conflict is a conspiracy within shield to use the tesseract as a means to create hightech weaponsthe six or seven if you count nick fury superheroes are treated pretty equally in screen time plot relevance internal conflict and combative ability hawkeyeclint barton seems to get shorted a little bit but he also isnt really himself for 75 of the movie either they are all distinctly different and as i mentioned before have clashing personalities the idea of bringing them together kind of defies the idea of a superhero who is basically supposed to be a one man show they are well developed too which is probably helped by the previous movies loki is a pretty good villain in a psychological sense though not the best of his kind by any means hes intimidating and has some battle skills with intelligence to boot but his most notable attribute is how he gets into peoples heads and exploits their weaknesses and humanity all the characters have flaws and all of these are addressed theyre personified well by their actors though nobody has a spectacular performance i could talk about each character separately but i dont think ive got enough space ill just say that the featured parts along with the obvious heroes and villains are phil coulson maria hill eric selvig and pepper potsthe visual effects and action choreography are really good as they should be with something that has such a big budget the directing is pretty good for most of it and even has a few outstanding moments i liked the script for the most part except when it came to comic relief sure some of its funny but its kind of annoying at the same time i dont think they should have just scrapped all attempts at humor but either they messed something up or thats just my sense of humorif you like any of the featured superheroes i would expect you to enjoy this though i dont know how well it sticks to the comic books if you havent seen any other superhero movies and want to ease your way into the genre this is the best movie to start with though not necessarily the best of its kind its worth seeing twice if you liked it the first time around if you hate absolutely every character from early on go ahead and stop but if you only have a problem with one or two characters keep going i absolutely hate tony starks arrogant personality but i like bruce banner and steve rogers so it remains a pretty positive experience its probably okay to watch it with your kids if your comfortable showing stuff like pirates of the caribbean narnia goonies or harry potter it is predominantly action but can cater a little to people who favor other genres so watch if youre interested but just know that you dont need background information apart from knowing character names overall rating 8210,fantasy
this is so funny to me at the end but it is an good movie you have to see it and in the move there is good vs bad and the good won then it was to save the world and to not get talking over by the evil and they had to get all the good people to come back and then they had to train them again it was good you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it,fantasy
im not a big fan of superhero movies but watching the turned me into one i love how they wrapped all of the separate storiesmovies and combined them into one i also like how they were able to keep all the actors and didnt need to recast the story was pretty easy to follow and understand it also included a lot of humor especially from robert downey jr i was also very impressed with the special effects especially the hulk the acting was also very good all of the characters that already had their movies did a good job sticking with that characters attitude and demeanor from those moviesto sum it up very impressed with the acting and everything else overall,fantasy
although some may not be huge fans of the traditional comic books the are placed into reality by science fiction animation and an outstanding all star cast at some point in the average persons life they have heard of captain america iron man hawkeye the hulk or the god of lightening thor these characters have been apart of the american culture for decades and at last they all come to life this movie highly recommended as a must see it has all the elements for a nonstop actionpacked family movie it is shear genius that the plot for this film be intertwined and ran off from the other previous movies that the starred in individually i do agree that some parental guidance should be suggested based on some scenes being potentially violent overall i give this film the highest rating do to the outstanding cast director influence costumes design plot of the movie and awesome display of special effects used to place the movie together,fantasy
i have always preferred dc movies to marvel however really changed that and provided a marvel movie that could go toe to toe with the best of other comic book adaptationsthis is one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen certainly the best marvel has put out the jokes are hilarious the action is intense every character even loki and nick fury have scenes that give us insights into their characters one of my 5 favorite movies of alltime and a must go for any fan of the comic book movie genre i cant wait for the age of ultron and the 3 with thanos1010,fantasy

reviewjoss whedon is often jokingly referred to as god of the nerds but his title is apt considering his ludicrously extensive experience in the socalled geek genre the creator of buffy the vampire slayer angel and firefly joss whedon has been kneedeep in the nerd world since he began directing and writing in 1997 a widely popular aficionado of the comic book world he has been known for his unique characters stories and usage of cheap practical effects instead of heavy cgi though he is an accomplished director it still came as a welcome surprise for comic book fans everywhere when he was chosen to direct the comicbook movie of a lifetime marvels thecaptain america thor hulk black widow hawkeye and iron man these are the earths mightiest heroes it was the opportunity of a lifetime for marvel to undertake the daunting endeavor of bringing all these wellknown heroes together in one feature film this type of movie had never been made before it consisted of a legion of famous actors that all had to be balanced perfectly with an interesting plot with running over each other or crowding the big screen when marvel announced in july of 2010 fanboys everywhere breathed a collective sigh of relief of course there was some doubt due to his inexperience with such strong actors and a huge budget but joss whedon of all people was going to get it rightthe creator of dr horribles singalong blog promised a spectacular show and he delivered with compliments the went on to be one of the top grossing films of all time shattering records by flimsy franchises such as harry potter twilight and titanic the received praise from a wealth of critics highlighting the powerful storytelling camaraderie between actors special effects and intense actions sequences that paid homage to its heavy comic book origins while remaining grounded in reality i personally have seen the fil over seven times and each time i notice new nuances in the plot and little easter eggs or special treats a director inserts into a film that only true believers notice unlike anything ever done before the blends dozens of famous actors into an engaging plot full of action that is contrasted by the subtle points of human reflection and punctuated by brilliant special effects and superb acting yes joss whedon promised a comicbook movie like never before and he surpassed even my expectations in truth this masterpiece of pop culture and cinematography leaves only one thing left to say assemble,fantasy
the was a movie i have wanted to see since i was a little kid i have dreamed of seeing captain america thor and the hulk on the same screen doing what they do best and the the didnt let me down it is by far the most well made super hero movie i have been able to watch first dont get me wrong i like the dark knight series but with the mixture of cg animation and live action flowing so well together i had a hard time figuring out what wasnt real in the scene thats what i want to see a movie where i cant see exactly what is real and whats fake the lived up to its hypethe acting within the was couldnt have been called anything but perfect with the great one liners and the impressive skill each line is delivered i couldnt have expected it to be better i even enjoyed watching samuel l jackson in this film and that is something very rare for me with the acting my biggest fear was each character fighting for the screen time and i didnt get that from any of them they molded themselves into one unit that rocked the audience,fantasy
this film is brilliant and the cast are absolutely perfect for their roles its funny and witty and will constantly keep you giggling throughout the movie the action scenes are amazing and executed brilliantly i adore all the marvel characters and i was very impressed with this movie if you love marvel characters lots of action and hilarious one liners from mr tony stark then this movie is for you the soundtrack is great and the music suits every scene i think that the hulk in the film is awesome and the story line is brilliant and doesnt get boring or dull the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat whilst laughing your head off at the silly little one liners from the cast ,fantasy
im swearing off superhero movies ive become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who cant wait to see what hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters but after three iron men and now this i see a sameness in them all and im not equipped properly to enjoy them as i should im still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at the special effects are beyond belief and some of the characters have some dimension that said i think i would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character what his or her powers are and how they fit together there is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others this is what makes comics what they are i read lots of comics as a kid so i do understand the milieu when you get right down to it however they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy its like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way its a cast of characters what represent simple things both good and evil ill leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines,fantasy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morningnick fury samuel l jackson head of defence agency sheild is thrown into action when a powerful device called the tesseract is stolen by loki tom hiddleston the renegade son of odin and a wicked god banished for his nature he calls all the superheroes together from around the globe to unite as one to save the earth but upon lokis capture they start to question their assignment and whether theyre being told the whole truthsuperhero movies seem to be the in thing at the moment the big studios still requiring a guaranteed fan base and surefire box office return in these recessionary times and so some bright spark in the marketing department had the foresight to imagine them all coming together as one supposing the ardent fans would go crazy and flock in droves to the theatres to catch it while personally i prefer the action films more grounded in reality there is still a young boy in me who can still find an appeal in the flashy suits and fantasy adventure it says a lot that assemble where all the big marvel comics names with the exception sadly of the punisher whose antics would probably have been too violent for a family film manages to be more of an exhilarating thrill ride than all the films from recent times that inspired itjoss whedon has crafted a colourful flashy sensory extravaganza that brings the characters to life in ways none of their first recent outings could and never manages to drag at quite a bit over two hours working together as one the gang manage to be more effective than they ever could on their lonesomes forging an unwitting chemistry together as events roll on while you can never shake the feeling theres a part of them that would still like to rip each others throats out luckily whedon never forgets to inject the script with flashes of humour at regular intervals resulting in material that never takes itself too seriously unlike maybe some of the original films which sets it on the right trackwhile the all star cast all manage to bring their respective characters to life in their own way its probably robert downey jr as tony starkiron man who steals the show firing off a wise cracking charisma through out that makes him stand out while scarlett johansson is an alluring femme fatale and hiddleston is a hissable villain meanwhile other big name stars like jeremy renner and mark ruffalo are pushed further back and occupy less screen time but casting aside the main thing here the action and special effects are appropriately spectacular and round off probably the most satisfying film ive seen in this series ,fantasy
as you probably will notice from reading the reviews here on imdb this movie is quite the hit or missi dont read the marvel comics but i have always been interested in the marvel universe the heroes the foes etc i actually like most of the movie adaptations even if theyre silly predictable and poorly written sometimesbut this one this one became my favorite marvel movie to this date why it gave me the exact thing i wanted heroes interacting with each other lots of action and an epic finaleif youre not a fan of superhero movies hate action and cant watch an old concept without whining about it being an old concept you will most likely not be entertained by thismy only complain with this movie is that it should have had at least one more nonshield hero it was kinda awkward with the whole superhero groupthing with just iron man and captain america sitting there in one scene hopefully our team gets expanded in the followup,fantasy
the is unbelievable not only is this the best comic book movie ever made but this is the best movie i have ever seen period in my opinion the was a masterpiece put together film by film starting with iron man it slowly continued to assemble as the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger camewith all of them being great movies the first hint appeared after iron man 1s credits it showed samuel l jackson as nick fury speaking to tony stark about joining initiative in that one short scene an masterpiece was dramatically buildingdirector joss whedon known for buffy the vampire slayer takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and brought forth the themselves iron mantony starkrobert downey jr captain americasteve rogerschris evans thor odinsonchris hemsworth hulkbruce bannermark ruffalo black widownatasha romanoffscarlett johansson and hawkeyeclint bartonjeremy renner as assembled by nick fury whedons scripts usually include clever banter gripping action sequences and an air of mystery and the is no exception whedon has an extreme love for comic books and he proves it in this moviethe acting is spectacular they literally bring the characters to life robert downey jr does iron man almost effortlessly delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his charisma charm and smugness to glow through downey is the definitive reallife iron man chris evans does a great captain america chris hemsworth as the god of thunder has some awesome battle scenes and delivers the funniest moments scarletts black widow has a backstory and shes far more than a pretty face shes twice as deadly as a real black widow she also plays her character very well although jeremys hawkeye has the least depth he also did a great performance now to the jolly green giant mark ruffalo by far hes the best hulk actor more so than eric bana and edward norton he does both characters perfectly and hes the actor that stands out samuel also did a fantastic job on fury clark greggs phil coulson comes backsadly for the last time and codie smulders makes her debut as maria hilland shes a welcome addition the villain is loki laufeysontom hiddleston tom plays the god of mischief masterfully and he gets the most fanbase too the story is also really welldonesorry if this spoils it for you it shows loki trying to get the cosmic cubeor the tesseract in this universe so that he can have a chitauri army as promised by the other so he can invade earth in response to this nick fury assembles the to save the world exciting isnt itthe is also wellpaced at a running time of 2 hours the acting is perfect the effects are perfect and the script is especially perfect for those that havent any of the other filmsyou need to before you get to this weve provided you just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without feeling overdone mr whedon provides far far more than just a standard comic book film but a story with extreme reason thats teamed up with incredible action and humor although the film is filled with larger than god characters none are shortchanged each character is given at least one great scene to work with and the opportunities stay fresh the films finale provides a amazingly deafening crescendo of action that is beyond breathtaking like the other films be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence which provides a surprising reveal so dont walk outi went into the with quite high expectations since theres a lot of hype and the films before this were great after viewing the initial trailers and felt interestedand slightly blown away this would be like the others it was only a matter of minutes after the film started that i was put at ease and just minutes later when the film crushed my expectations into the roofto death by the way i never wouldve imagined that it was possible to put this kind of magic onto the screen what i was watching im so happy that marvel had the sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with these characters in the manner in which they did proudly marvel studios and disney truly deserves the films praise and the 1 billion that this masterpiece made this is the movie the ultimate feature it cant get better than this see this on theaters on every showing buy this on dvd buy this on bluray do all this with every chance you got it will be entirely worth the moneyrating infinity10,fantasy

the movie i chose to write my review on is the movie i chose this movie because it is an action packed ad enter that will blow the mind of any human being who watches it initially the movie has some incredible special effects furthermore the producer of the movie did a great a outstanding job in the form that he made the movie however the movie did have one or two scenes hear and their that were not so great but later would insert scenes that made the watchers of the movie jump out of their seat at the movie theater nevertheless you can not forget the actors who did an outstanding job toinitially the movie has some outrageous special effects just like for example the scene where hulk smashes the huge snake with ugly creatures ready to fight inside of it nevertheless the scene were that me my laugh a whole lot was the scene were one of the gods from another dimension was trying to explain to hulk that he was a god and that gods should not be beaten hulk just grabbed him and slammed him on the ground a numerous amount of times additionally another special affect was where iron man shot captain america with one of his lasers that caused captain america to fly back and hit the ground in an instantsignificantly i personally liked the special effect where one of the people at the god and the ballet came back and him them in the faceultimately the producer did an outstanding job producing the movie and adding the special effects needed at the time neededfor example the scene where the god was talking to hulk he added the special effect that allowed hulk to slam the god on the god the hard groundmoreoverthe scene where thor was falling out of the sky because he was trapped in a huge glass container the producer joss whedon allowed him to break the glass on the cotainer an escape right before hitting the ground henceforth the movie director also did a great job on the scene where one of the cops would not listen to captain america so captain america destroyed a few of the creatures right in front of his eyes that made him listen to captain americahowever some people might get get some despite from the scenes were the creatures keep coming in and the keep destroying themspecifically when right after hulk destroyed one of the huge snakes with creatures in because whoever it is that is watching the movie could basically predict what is going to occur next essentially some people do like to predict what is going to occur nextnevertheless you can not forget the actors who also did an outstanding job additionally like for example chris evans who played captain america who did an excellent job acting in addition chris hemsworth did a great job playing thor and destroying creaturesfinally as the reader can see the movie is on of the best movies ever made additionally you should watch this movie because it will blow you away and will make not want to watch any other movielastlyyou will not regret watching this movie because it is an action packed adventure,fantasy
the special effects were amazing i loved the way they worked humor into the movie to have so many powerful richly developed characters come together into a single movie with a story line that gives each a fair chance to shine is an amazing achievement given that these characters first formed in my imagination as a kid when i was buying the comic books and developed over the years in various movies seeing this all come together in such a great presentation was entertainment at its best should you take your kids there was no transformer gstring  bathroom stall moments thank god there was a lot of violence but it was presented in a star wars like fashion that did the best job possible at reducing the goriness factor our kids absolutely loved this movie thank you for all who worked so hard to make such a great entertaining move,fantasy
i have to give it 1010 as from start to finish i was engrossed in this film at the cinema and have watch it many times since its release on blu ray great super hero movie and all the characters have enough screen time and no one hero takes over the film the graphics are exceptional and in 3d was truly brilliantthe one character i though might look a bit ropey was the hulk as in other films he has never looked right but here i would have to say he was probably my favorite character player very well by mark ruffaloif you love this kind of film then you wont be disappointed sit back with the popcorn and enjoy,fantasy
if you love comic books then you will love marvels the the is filled with action suspense and amazing characters the movie comes from the last 5 movies iron man iron man 2 captain america the incredible hulk and thor at the end of each movie the team for was metioned now in 2012 the have assembled and created a great moviethe story starts off with you on the edge of your seat when a previous villain returns threating the world with his brand new army its up to nick furythe leader to call on earths mightiest heros the unfourtuately this is the first meeting of each otherso things dont go so well at first after a series of events the pull it together and prepare to fight the is a movie you will want to watch over and over again the movie is now for sale still exciting and amazing anyone who knows these greatheros will be enjoying one of the greatest movies of the year,fantasy
nick fury samuel l jackson brings the together to locate and obtain the tesseract a cube of untold power that could possibly power the whole world but it is also needed by loki tom hiddleston to open a portal for his army to come through and subjugate the people of earth to his will the have their work cut out for them once they stop fighting with each other and learn to get along this is perhaps the best cgi i have ever seen along with fantastic editing i know in the past we had very good cgi with beowulf live free or die hard transformers and 2012 among some others but a true salute should go to director joss whedon and maybe an oscar as well this was truly well organized and seamless throughout the story was plausible without getting into silliness and unbelievable cartoon animation effects and effective dialogues helped make this as real as possible kudos who are the ironman robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth the black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner i was not familiar with the black widow and hawkeye i was looking for billy batson captain marvel but he was from an older time and that is the only explanation i could think of poor billy batson was probably in a oldage home and he was never referenced in this so no shazzam for us pity the thing i noticed is the storyline kind of continued a slender thread from previous ironman and thor movies thor was assured that his love interest jane natalie portman was safe from what was going to happen in this manhattan ny location i am pretty sure we saw scarlett johansson in one of the previous ironman movies but not as the black widow and am not sure what role she did play and of course there was pepper gwyneth paltrow tony starks ironman love interest yes she still looks very good but at first i thought someone else played pepper as the actress didnt at first look like paltrow but it was her maybe getting a little long in the tooth does that go figure hey it will happen to all of us bummer also we noticed that tom hiddleston also played loki in the movie thor so this was like old home week for some of this cast and for us as well very good i dont like giving oscars to bad guys or in this case bad gods but i must say hiddlestons loki was very good and may get one he was almost likable at times did i really say that all in all this is one terrific movie and the pacing is excellent and you will forget all about the snacks you brought in to see this movie as your eyes never leave the screen its mesmerizing there may be some confusion for a while when you do not understand why the are at each others throats for the longest time and you cannot figure out why hawkeye is working for loki the bad god and stepbrother of thor but stay with it and it will all work out and you will understand the acting performances all around are first rate and again not enough can be said about the cgi the editing the fights and battle scenes and the cinematography as well all were terrific kudos 1010 violence yes sex no nudity no language no,fantasy
there are nothing but good things i can say about the this has got to be the first superhero film that really gave audiences everything they wanted and morethe character development was done prior to this film so they dont need to waste time with that they just get right to it and it works fortunately we already got to know iron man thor hulk captain america and to a smaller extent agent phil colson black widow hawkeye and of course nick furythe story is excellent it moves forward at a very even pace the characters play off of each other and even have a few chicken fights here and there but not so much as to drag the story down there are enough funny parts to keep it from being too serious and it really gives each member of the team something to do this is everything ive desperately wanted for the justice league to be for years now admittedly im more of a dc man and the jla is always gonna be my favorite team its a real bummer to me that audiences who arent familiar with the comics are seeing hawkeye before the green arrow who has been around for a few decades prior oh well you cant win them allthere are just so many great moments in the film to look forward to if you are viewing it for the first time watch it until the very end of the credits you wont be disappointedi cant wait to buy this when it comes out on dvdjoss whedon delivers the goods in every sense of the word,fantasy
the is a brilliant science fiction action super hero movie wit loads of cool characters from some movies like iron man robert downey jr caption america chris evans and lots of others u will enjoy this film a lot its a cool super hero team up the the story is about when loki returns he steals a a deadly device that can destroy the world and iron man caption america thor black widow and hulk all team up to stop the threat spoiler hawk eye turns into a bad guy for a bit and then the turn him good againthe action all starts in new york its so epic also its aw fa funny at bits 2 i give the film a 1010 go see this film its okay for kids and the whole family,fantasy
the finally assembled this year and i believe as everybody does that it is awesome it in a sense is a flawless because it does everything that it is trying to and does it well its just as good as it needed to be and more however is it cinematic genius and one of the greatest films of all time no its loads and loads of fun the action scenes are great the dialog is very witty and the acting is good but thats pretty much it im not downgrading the movie at all everyone should see it and it is great but it doesnt take any risks its a safe film with nothing really unexpected asides from the dark knight it is the best superhero movie thus farstill waiting for dark knight rises but its the basic take over the world plot and theres just nothing that isnt surprising in the movie is it a good film yes its even a great film and does what its trying to do perfectly but is it the 49th best movie ever far far from it good even great but not cinematic history,fantasy
well what i found so humorous was one of my female cousin text and said did you see the mind you shes not into marvel movies at all and thought that was an excellent movie you know i had to go see it even more whats great about the you dont have to see the other marvel movies to follow the plot however it would be helpful to have a vague knowledge on each superhero the makes me want to go back to my library to review the other marvel movies i saw to put the puzzle together i was rattling my brain when i saw samuel jackson and couldnt recall which marvel flicks he was in all the superheros got a fair amount of spot light unpredictable plot tones of actions over 2 hours and excellent visual effects this will be a great introduction to marvel characters to those who arent accustomed to such genre and a great way for the ladies to impress their mates,fantasy
710 a tremendous amount of hype had been built up for this film and in midapril the reviews started pouring in there was so much raving over it saying that it was the best comic book movie ever made they even said it was better than the dark knight after i viewed it for the first time i called shenanigans on this filmit is very slow to start i felt very sleepy at times because things just seemed to drag on and on the first hour is just tedious on top of that its very clich these guys get together but they dont get along at all who couldve seen it coming another issue is the villain loki just is plain uninteresting to me he did fine in thor but im just not feeling his character in this movie i think that thanos is the best possible choice for a villain and im pretty sure hell be in the sequelnow the good thing about this is that it accomplishes something never before done outside of the animated marvel universe the have assembled it is great to finally see the best heroes marvel has to offer being showcased together on the big screen very nice however you would think with the complexity it took to get these fellas together the plot would have complexity no the idea behind the film is all too simple just another alien invasionon the whole it really isnt bad at all it just isnt anything excellent the fact that this gets compared to the dark knight is really upsetting this to me is just another average teamup flick,fantasy
ok where do i begin with this well firstly for those of you that dont know me personally i am a massive geek fanboy of comics namely marvel i have anticipated a marvel mash up of characters ever since the first xmen movie hit our screens in the late 90s to have that dream finally come true with some of my favourite comic characters captain america hulk iron man i was wetting myself just watching the promos and the lack lustre build up movies thor iron man captain america  the really dire incredible hulk not since 1999 and the release of the first xmen movie had i anticipated a super hero movie so much so obviously the hype and level of expectation i had was very high all the positive reviews  ground breaking box office takings were pointing at this movie being greatgood it is great it isnt quite there dont get me wrong i loved it easily one of the best super hero movies since xmen first class x2  the dark knight but is it really better than these in fact is it even better than the punisher which i loved by the way well i aint so sure to begin with the movie brings the ensemble cast together really nicely they all are fighting towards a common enemy there isnt much need for a backstory to any of the audience as you are assumed to have watched the individual films before watching but even if you havent its not exactly rocket science we all know bruce banner was hit with gamma rays and turns green when hes mad the story is pretty simple the earth is threatened by another world forces led by thors halfbrother  loki and back on earth nick fury leader of shield assembles the rag tagged bunch of super heroes we all know as the each avenger gets good equal screen time which is another plus of the movie even the not so super heroes like hawkeye  black widow who are just glorified normal humans get a good amount of screen time id say hawkeye more than black widow actually but the whole movie is rather predictable now i know i shouldnt complain about this and it shouldnt really count as a negative towards this movie 10 times out of 10 if you go to watch a super hero movie you know the good guys are going to prevail over the dark forces its just the route taken to defeat the enemies that got me a little annoyed first the mind control of hawkeye to trying to get the bruce to turn into the hulk on the shield sky ship all of it you could see coming a mile off and were kind of just waiting for these bits to end when would the rescue hawkeye from his mental capture when would bruce turn green if they kind of just sprung it on us instead of building up to it and spoon feeding us it couldve been better all in all an enjoyable action movie with surprisingly funny bits mainly thanks to downey junior delivering his lines to aplomb still looking forward to the sequel which should be better,fantasy
i imagined better before i watched the film but it was goodi think the main character will be hulk because hulks scenes were very funny and wittythe place where the film was made was excellentthe superheroes were made successfullythey should make second film as fast as they cani didnt watch this kind film but im used to watching this kind film and i started to like this kind filmif i had gone when it started first i would have enjoyed moreim sure a lot of people like iti still enjoyed while i was watching filmmy favorite hero is iron man,fantasy
all of your favorite superheroes together in one movieits every geeks dream and it must definitely pays off this actionpacked thrill ride never stops for air and has such great actors all together in one movie the craziness starts when thors brother wants to take over earth and shield enlists the help of an elite team of superheroes called the iron man hulk black widow thor hawkeye and captain america with all these differing personalities comes a battle of egos resulting in many battle royals which is awesome to see it all leads to one of the most thrilling endings of all time awesomeness in its purest form,fantasy
finallythe assembleit was quite a wait for the fans and trust meevery waited minute was worth itgoodstarting with cast and actingevery character has been evenly and uniformly craftedacting by whole cast is above parbut eventually iron man and hulksurprise element are the main highlightsdirecting was top notchits a difficult task to direct such a huge project with such huge stars but joss pulled it off with flying coloursspecial effects are of a grade and the humour element is just awesomein 3d or 2d well watch it in both cause this movie will never get oldbadthe villain could have been more larger than life considering so many superheroes againstbut this does not spoil the movie at all,fantasy
i saw it in 2d its a combination of the ultimates 2 comic book and the second half of transformers dark of the moon the concept is almost right out of the comic the comic is far superior and just like the transformers movie the second half is all action with otherworldly technological beings destroying the city in a battle against heroes trying to protect people and ward off the baddies at the same timeremember that scene where sam witwicky was running through all the destruction and he was jumping over cars and stuff like youve never seen him do before and wouldnt expect him to do in the first place there was a damn near identical scene with captain america doing the same damn things but you expect him to be able to do what they were showing remember how shockwave and his driller were plowing through buildings and causing total destruction the asgardian ships from lokis army did the same thing remember how starscream got damaged by sam and they made him look like a total wuss during his death scene loki got his ass handed to him and totally embarrassed by the hulk remember how they opened a portal to cybertron and things didnt quite work out same damn thing happened here with asgardthe big secret of the movie that was on my mind the whole time was who was loki getting help from after the first credits that was revealed and its a pretty big deal for longtime marvel comic readers its equivalent to the last scene in the last episode of the wolverine  the xmen cartoon unlike that where well never get a second season to continue that story 2 has the potential to be an even bigger better movie if they do it right the whole asgardearth thing has played itself out in the animated marvelverse movies and cartoons to the point of them needing to do something new and move on i never saw iron man 2 and dont ever plan on seeing it but it does help to have seen the marvel movies to have a better understanding of whats going on in this one because there are references and flashbacks the scene after the full credits is short and only meant to be humorousunlike someone i know who said to not pay for this movie id say its definitely worth paying for its a popcorn flick and high on entertainment there were only a few cuss words so kiddies might enjoy it if they have the attention span and most dont to handle the pacing of the movie in the second half there arent any overextravagant mark millar stunts and its not too technical its a fairly simple movie thats easy to follow as one can expect from a marvel comic book movie if there are any comparisons of this to the dark knight because of its box office take squash that out of your mind theres absolutely no comparison of any kind to the dc movie other than the fact that theyre both based on comic book materiali give the movie 8 out of 10 stars and i rate it that high for its entertainment value you get your moneys worth from this flick and its deserving of all of its success one thing i noticed that most people probably havent is the title when it opens and even during the rolling credits its called marvels the theyve clearly got tyler perry syndrome as if anyone is gonna mistake this for the british tv show or its film adaptation i guess they gotta cover their bases,fantasy
i hope this turns out to be next big deal i hope it gets up there with avatar hell i hope it passes it the is on the list as number seven of top selling movies in history so everyone who has said that you cant take comic book movies serious you have just been bitch slapped and had your dumb ass packin and guess what its not over wait for the dvd thats gonna be threw the roof and then we get to look forward too iron man 3 thor 2 captain america 2 and i hope they are doing a black widow movie and a hawkeye film then they need to make add new to those movies then may the 2 rise of thanos i think that would be a badass title for the movie,fantasy
as the summary says its awesome i mean it by each single letter you rarely find these awesome movies to watch these days this is one of a kind movie i have ever seen you dont get to watch all the superheroes on one screen the director got this movie a really good plot and the reality that the superheroes quarrel when work as team every scene was enjoyed by me doesnt matter if you watch movies every day or once a year this is a must if you love marvel superheroes then this is it i know that this much hype which you would get after reading this may raise your expectations so high that you may get disappointed so dont expect so much but yes it is a awesome movie depends on you thinking totally,fantasy
a valiant effort i liked it it hit a lot of great notesbut something was missingi agree movies can and should be about funim having fun when im swept away by a compelling storynot when im bombarded with visuals and the former is lackingso much of the is done wellcasting performances dialog certainly visualsthe only thing that might have done more for me is once again a plot that is executed a little better i had a hard time feeling the stakes loki is a great characteri felt his rage angst and bitterness in thor driving the antagonism thus the storya story has to sell the villains goal or we dont feel the stakes and thus dont really care about whats going onunless were so excited to see characters in live action wed be just as thrilled with seeing a 2 hr slide show of stillsill give you a perfect example batman 1989 and dark knight are essentially the same plot joker causing mayhem for kicks no specific goal no dollar amount he wants to make no prize he wants to acquirebut unlike many i did not like batman in 89 i dont like or appreciate visuals apart from a wellexecuted story im sorry its not snobbery or failure to lighten up and have fun i just dont have fun when im not watching a wellexecuted story dark knight sells it batman didnt how execution compare alfreds searing line some men arent looking for anything logical they cant be bought bargained or reasoned with some menjust want to watch the world burn with the joker in 89 so gentleman thats how it is until vinnie resurfaces im the acting president and i say that starting with this 200 year festival we run the city into the ground zzzzzzzzzzzzztheres more to it than thisthe whole film dark knight is presented in a way that sells the jokers goalsbut in bow yield kneel lokis speech you were meant to be ruled was goodi almost bought itsuperman ii sold this type of antagonism a dick donner treated zod and the villains with an almost shakespearian reverence it sold and b by the end we felt the stakes as people were actually seen getting hurt remember the woman holding her arm supermanhelp us by the end of my adrenaline should have been pumping as the city was being destroyed and i just wasnt feeling it even with its pg13 rating could have gotten away with a woman cradling her husband killed by debris imagine what someone of downey jrs talent could have done with a scene like that the rage building in his face as he looks up at the onslaught the mask closes and he rockets up toward the heavens to take on lokis assault forcetoo stereotypical in the hands of a good director i think not nothing that you and i see is wholly new anymoreits all in the execution excellence is more important than imagined originalityan example of a superhero ensemble piece that did it just a little better xmen magnetos reasons for his war on humanity were solid sold and felt from the opening scenes up through his chilling line to professor x and i will bring you hope my old friend i only ask one thing in return dont get in my way joss whedon is to be commended its hard to make a superhero piece much less an ensemble superhero piece much less one thats any good hollywood has wholly botched a good number of superhero films and with all the resources at its disposal there is really no excuse was really really good and i liked it it missed some opportunities for mejust a few,fantasy
before i review this title i want to explain why there are so many bad reviews about this film a lot of people dont know the back story of any of these superheroes hydra the tesseract also known as the cosmic cube loki or the themselves joss did not have the time to explain all of this in pretty much expected people to already know about these things that being said for the people who are avid fans and know the story you will love this movie it is obvious that joss is a fan of this series and loved making this movie everything in it screamed comic book even the stan lee inspired underlying theme of what it means to be a hero is prevalent when iron man learns that suits and power arent what makes you a hero but the willingness to act and sacrifice for others is what truly makes you a hero i think a lot of people missed this but this is what comic books are all about and that is why this film is magical as for the cgi it was amazing and necessary in order to make this film wires would not have cut it in this case no pun intended this is the movie all of us geeks have been waiting for every character was spot on except for maybe hawkeye and fury but i can overlook that the small details were amazing for example the hulk cannot lift thors hammer and captain america never kills anyone with a gun although he will use one to keep people at bay until he gets his shield back this movie is important to comic book aficionados everywhere because we finally have one that was done right thanks joss screw the mainstream this one is for us,fantasy
small spoilers im simplifying but only a little bitthis guy  on track record  should not be able to make films like thishe seems to fly in the face of convention  a man who appears to have an absolute passion for comic book nonsense yet still comes up with twists of character and manages to squeeze several massive egos in terms of character and i dare say actors onto the same film and also gets disney to pony up a mega budget to do sothis just does not happenand just to give two fingers to movie execs and critics alike  it is well written chock full of jaw dropping set pieces and well actedplease note some of the best performances are from people in tin suits and glittery halloween costumes thats how good it isit makes you suspend your disbelief and get drawn in to a very strong parallel to modern politics  who exactly are the villians anyway  whilst managing to keep cringing moments of sentiment  see any michael bay flick  pretty much at arms lengthmost notable are moments of the whedon trade mark  from firefly in particular  where he totally goes against viewer expectations with regard to conflict outcomesloki vs the hulk is particularly brilliant on that frontits a big movie its completely over the top comic book action and a small miracle it is as good as it ismy only gripe would be a few cheesy lines and the old us clich of english accent  skinny villain thing but this is one hell of an action movie and a pretty good film in its own rightand i dont even worship marvel stuff horay for fat nerds everywhere,fantasy
well i actually quite enjoyed this film but it is not exactly the type of film that one would go and watch to learn anything too deep it is sort of one of those films that has been a long time coming and quite anticipated and what is quite unusual for a film like this is that when i did get to see it i did actually quite enjoy it the movie itself is quite long and i must admit dominated a bit too much by robert downey jnr who plays iron man though the length of the movie didnt really put me off too muchi am not too sure on the workings behind the scenes but my understanding is that marvel and paramount have decided that they will become more consistent with their marvel based movies so that there is some consistency between them this is probably more important now in that they are bringing a number of superheroes from separate movies together so i guess consistency is important however one thing that i have noticed is that it appears that they have rushed a number of movies together such as captain america and thor so that they can have some more background for the major characters in this movie i do note though that while black widow makes an appearance in iron man ii hawkeye seems to be a new character for this particular filmthe pretty much takes off where iron man ii captain america and thor leave off iron man ii introduce nick fury as a major character who is the head of the initiative thor introduced loki as an antagonist and captain america introduces the tesserach the alien device that ends up causing all of the problems for earth and in particular bring loki across so that he might cause his mischief now i am not familiar with any of the comics or how loki is portrayed in the comics but with norse mythology i did not necessarily consider that loki was actually a bad guy just an annoying trickster however this film is not based on norse mythology but rather upon a series of comics based upon norse mythologyi guess one of the big problems with trying to do a film like this is working with a number of actors and deciding who is going to take the title role however i do note that the only real big name actors in this film would be rdj scarlett johanson and samual l jackson the others while they have movies to their name and do take the lead role in those movies in my mind at least do not have the huge name that the others do however i suspect it would not have been easy relegating rdj to a supporting role,fantasy
this is it this is what the nerd world has been waiting for for so long almost every marvel movie since iron man has been alluding to this film and weve all been so anxiously awaiting the first assembly of the marvels ultimate superhero alliance the unites iron man thor captain america black widow hulk and hawkeye making them a superhero team of epic proportions all brought together by nick fury the film tells the story of the forming of the as they are forced together in order to stop loki thors mischievous brother from waging an intergalactic war on earth the ensuing battle is one that strives to be of epic proportionsto say that the lived up to its hype would be giving it too much credit to say it is a letdown would be too harsh with the recent quality of superhero movies the was about as good as you could expect its a little simplistic doesnt go too deep yet it stands to be a hell of a lot of fun and theres nothing wrong with that after watching the slew of superhero movies that have come out in the last 3 or 4 years this is what we have been waiting for and it essentially doesnt let us down its what we want to see when watching all these great superheroes come together to fight the forces of evil the action is great and they dynamics between our diverse cast of heroes are excellentit is almost a requirement that you watch the previous marvel movies to fully understand the relationships developing here such as lokis significance and why exactly he is after the tesserac an artifact that can open portals to different worlds yet at the same time there is a lot of undeveloped story for some of the other characters black widow and hawkeye are the two that most come to mind black widow appeared multiple times in the iron man films and we got a feel for her there but hawkeye was only treated to about 30 seconds of screen time in thor yet in the we have to assume a lot of information about his character as we dont get to learn much about him it almost feels as if there should have been a hawkeye movie released before this onehowever this hawkeye dilemma highlights one aspect of the film that can be good for some and bad for others there is a lot going on in this film and it has to move very fast even for a two and a half hour film this is the reason the story is kept fairly simple and the bulk of the film focuses on bringing together the films ensemble and of course the action which is nothing short of awesome you can expect great explosions awesome fights and breathtaking cgi throughout the whole film and while it is nothing exceptional it makes the what it is a summer blockbuster the isnt the superhero film to end all superhero films but it is certainly a lot of fun theres no reason you shouldnt enjoy the film if you sit back and relax and watch the excitement unfold,fantasy
marvel has been spending no less than five movies setting up this movie i had my doubts but i see the payoff since theyve already established the main characters there was no need to do so again we could get right into the meat of the plotloki pops in from another dimension and is plotting to open a doorway that will let in a nasty bunch of aliens but what really works is the chemistry between the characters here nick fury breaks out his rolodex and calls the well except for thor he just kind of shows upwhat we get are some fairly effective character interaction scenes and a lot of cgi action goodness that didnt look too fake and was fairly excitingmorton downey jr is the heart of this movie and he gets all the best lines tim middelton is effective as loki matching wits with the various characters the other actors are good enough in their roles again a movie with no less than seven superheroes was more likely to be a mess and this wasnt so i give them their props,fantasy
i watched this movie at the cinema and i have no reason not to corroborate the great reviews it has generated that said joss wheldon showed a perfect understanding of each of those superheroes as he was able to find space to depict each of their individual charactersbut what made this movie a blockbuster winner in my perspective are the mesmerizing action sequences the stunning computer generated scenes and of course the plethora of an ensemble cast that is robert downey jr iron man chris hemsworth thor mark ruffalo hulk chris evans captain america samuel ljackson nick fury tom hiddleston loki gwyneth paltrow pepper potts stellan skarsgaard dr erik selvig scarlett johansson black widow and jeremy renner hawkeyemark rufallo was ordinarily effective as bruce banner albeit he will never surpass edward norton for the same role however there are some things i wouldve loved to see in the movie that i believe wouldve complemented this great flick very well i felt that the presence of jane foster was of crucial essence since loki threatened thor that he would pay her a visit hulks new face didnt dwell well with me as it looked more animated compared to the fierce looking one of the hulk reboot i so wish there were also some enchanting melancholic scenes which could have added nicely to the entertainment this movie offeredand how can bruce banner concede so easily to joining a shield led operation after the gamma radiation feud he had with general thunderbolt ross and phil coulsons death if he is dead was also untimely if not needless as he was a marvellous complement to the shield as an underground operatorbut despite my remarks this is an awesome blockbuster so if youre looking for a great entertaining flick which is not in the realms of extraordinary this ones for you my rating is 8810seka samuel gaula south africa,fantasy
wowjust wow superhero movies have come and gone and not too many are very well made hollywood eventually takes a good concept and then they add multiple villains or partners to the main hero and things do not work out was this going to happen with the how would you get multiple heroes in one movie and tell a good story what would josh whedon bring to the movie is this movie going to have the golden whedon touch that was shown in firefly or the horrible disaster known as dollhouse lets start with the story the script was well written about how the team was assembled and how they went from individuals to a team the foe was well created and produced a nice adversary for the team and the dialog was above the norm that you see in superhero moviescharacters whether you are a fan of the hulk captain america thor or iron manyou will not be disappointed each of them have adequate screen time and all of them have wonderful action sequences though black widow and hawkeye are not from the original team they became much later they fit into the movie well and add to the dimension that loki brings to the storyeverything is great about this movie the film was well paced the direction was great the acting was super for a comic book adaptation and the action was outofthisworldeasily one of the best if not the best superhero movie to date highly highly highly recommended i would suggest 3d since there are many scenes that are dazzling in the 3d format,fantasy
just sat thru a 14 or 15 hr superhero marathon ending with the at around 12 midnight it made all the previous superhero movies that came before it feel like a small tease snack leading up to the epic meal time main coarse all i can say is wow the way they actually gave almost equal screen time to the characters and yet your favorite which ever one it is feels like they got the perfect amoount of screen time to compliment the movie perfect balance and i mean perfect the length was also perfect stay after the credits priceless cant say enough about this movie id say this was better than than any superhero movie before it including the dark knight this actually has the potential of dethroning avatar as the top box office this was epic,fantasy
with the disappointment of thor and the only average hulk films i wasnt expecting much to come from this film was i wrong the work of josh whedon and his crew is truly admirable as the film not only had a great story it was also directed so perfectly having so many superheroes in the film i doubted whether there would be too much going on but it was just right every hero had a vital role robert downey jr was once again superb in his witty but sensational role as iron man the film incorporated humour at just the right times and did not go overboard and make the film a joke mark ruffalo done a great job as the hulk and completely changed my opinion of the hulk the hulk in this film was a million times better than the others he was more like the comics where he is not humongous like in the past films incredible hulk in this film he was awesome hulk smash this film kept me gripped and laughing i could not close my eyes for one second this film is on par with other great films for example the dark knight they are the only two films i have rated 10 out of 10 i have to say job well done because this was great,fantasy
this was my favorite one out of all of them so far out of all the marvel movies ive seen it twice already midnight showing then the first one in the morning and both times i jumped laughed and had a fantastic time watching it i have a few tips before you check it out tip one is is wait for after all the credits there will be less then a minute of them then something then there will be like 5 minutes of them then something again tip two make sure you either know the comics or have seen all the movies of marvel because if not you will most likely get lost only thing is i wish they would have had is spiderman in the movie not a huge deal but still who does not love him overall i would give it 10 out of 10 stars because of the action laughter and everything else that comes along with it,fantasy
now this is a movie that i will recommend to anyone it is awesome i been two times to see it in 3d already it have cost me the price of 42 already only for the tickets but it was worth every penny spent and for the cocacola and popcorn i would say i have spent about 55 only on the but i am guessing for a the avenger ii and iii etc because with robert downey jr as iron man it is a must see and waiting for the wolverine to come into the i saw iron mantony stark in the wolverine movie so there must be another coming with the wolverine also joining the and is the biggest villain we see in the end thanos it must be it is for me only thanos and loki that are the interesting villains it was also a time where jla and met together and fought villains but not all jla and characters are great the best ones we would as audience see together in a battle for good i feel is superman batman spiderman the wolverine captain america the hulk thor and the daredevil of the villains there are only some i can think of that would be supercool in a fight against evil the evilest of them all doomsday thanos loki luthor and zodi am waiting and looking forward to the next round1010 on imdbcom  this movie is one of the greatest actionadventure movies i ever seen ill buy the bluray when that gets out all of them,fantasy
look im never one for analyzing superhero movies too much they usually fail to impress although the last 2 featuring the individual namely thor and captain america were definitely cause to be hopeful then comes along a trailer of containing an impressive ensemble of superheroes thor iron man captain america hawkeye black widow and most importantly the hulkok so it can either be something or nonsense thought ibut i seriously never thought that i would come out of the theater with a smile saying that it was totally worth it i repeat the summary statement is probably the best superhero movie ever made it has the story which is although not unlike many other such movies but is treated and presented very very well well i dont know about you but at least me and a sizable few million other people loved it the action does not disappoint in the least but instead of making the audience run headlong into it it is built up slowly but surely the dialogs the pace the visuals and the story overall make this one hell of a watchseriously you will not be disappointed,fantasy
spolier alert dont read further if you feel you dont wanna get your hopes too high trust me guys the movie is so freaking awesome any superhero movie fan would be in for a treat but the least you expect from it the more you would enjoy and savor each and every 150 minute of this flickmy hands have been itching to write this review from the moment the end credits rolled on the screento start off take a bow and applaud mr joss whedon the director and writer of this movie he has done what countless movie makers couldnt achieve when they attempted to make a super hero movie with the same set of characters and actors his ensemble of superheroes has more character depth more action more story and some effervescently witty dialogues than any of the other solo movies based on the characters of this film whedon has come up with a script thats cheeky and breezy full of witty banter and sly popculture shoutouts as well as selfreferential humor one that moves with an infectious energy that almost makes you lose track of its twoandahalfhour running timethe hype has been building for years and it couldnt possibly be more deafening at this point four years ago around the same time iron man arrived in theaters and kicked off a bold longterm plan by hollywood standards at least that would see four different marvel superheroes appear in their own solo movies then unite in a single film featuring not just all of the previous films stars but many of their supporting cast toowhats unbelievable though is that despite all of the odds against it and the stratospheric expectations heaped upon it the still manages to not only live up to those expectations but to exceed them with an epic adventure thats just as impressive as its largerthanlife charactersfor a film that required so many prologues to get to this point its surprising how little upfront exposition is required to bring newcomers up to speed with the universe while the film clearly assumes some familiarity with the main characters and a few basic plot points of the preceding films iron man the incredible hulk thor iron man 2 and captain america the first avenger cowriters joss whedon and zak penn have done a great job of weaving any necessary information into the early portions of the film and making the exposition feel organicthe premise of the is this thors evil brother loki tom hiddleston has returned and he plans to use the tesseract the powerful glowing blue cube last seen in captain america to take over earth when loki proves too powerful for nick fury samuel l jackson and shield to take down on their own all of the characters from the previous marvel studios films team up to defeat loki and the alien horde helping himto be honest on the face of it the plot does seem to be taken straight out of a comic book and is laughably oldschool in its simplicity but its genius lies in how this barebones narrative foundation allows the films talented cast and creative team the room to do what they do bestits the sort of adventure that comic fans are accustomed to seeing in print but just like the best comics the truly shines in how it fills out its narrative skeleton and the area around these tropes with vibrant storytelling compelling character development and moments filled with so much heart  and humor  that the entire package stands on its ownjoss whedon has pulled off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast and giving everyone a chance to shine of balancing splashy set pieces with substantive ideology stuff gets blown up real good in beautifully detailed 3d in the  the area in and around grand central terminal for example gets obliterated beyond recognition in an exhausting climactic battle  but the film as a whole is never a mess from a narrative perspectiveread more at  httpdevlifeintechnicolorcom20120501the thebestsuperheromovieneedisaymore,fantasy
i am an unapologetic fan girl the very idea of with joss directing was enough to send me to happy land and i am happy to say he lived up to it first and foremost mark ruffalo as hulk owns that part hands down the only portrayal that has clicked on every single level all talk of norton should be left behind once and for all because as far as casting goes third time was a charm the story moves fast without sacrificing the story lines or character development loki is an awesome awesome villain in this and both black widow and hawkeyes characters were really well fleshed out and joss whedon was born to write for rdj stay for the two post credit scenes i can sum this movie up short and sweet god bless you joss whedon,fantasy

the film is perfectly crafted in every way acting storyline image and sound a real triumph what a summer blockbuster should be it sets a very high standard for upcoming superhero or comicbook movies the characters are well developed and very well acted all the cast did an amazing job in their roles each actor completely owns the character and only makes them more interesting an appealing to the audiencethe story is interesting  smart and entertaining it never gets campy or boring tons of wellplaced punchlines never forced or stupid the action sequences are amazing and perfectly placed in the plot there are no unnecessary placed fights andor specialeffectsdirecting and editing are absolutely topnotch you can see that there was flawless communication of the direction the movie wanted to take the visual and sound effects are eye and ear candy nothing short of outstanding the score really stands out it is the final addition to the team this is one happy fan thank you mr joss whedon i loved every second of this movie it had only been out for five days and id seen it three times already go see it i promise you will leave the theater wanting to see it again,fantasy
um yeah this movie sucks probably the worst superhero movie ever made bazinga im just joking its sarcasm this movie is the total package the entertainment value of this film is just through the roof from the beginning you are instantly hooked when i first watched the trailer i knew this movie would be awesome it did not fail to deliver packs an epic punch when you watch this for the record i have not seen the other hulk films because 1 he really isnt a favorite character of mine and 2 the cg look of the hulk just didnt appeal to me you watch the hulk in this film and your like whoa mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk was just pure genius each superhero gets equal screen time no one is above anyone and i actually preferred that this film is full of star power and im glad everyone got their share i am a visual effects artist and the effects for this film was just pure bred artistic masterpiece i thought that transformers 3 was just awesome in terms of the the visual effects but the is just superb the plot and character development is great everyone should see this movie even if you arent a comic book fan its pure entertainment value my rating is 1210 and im going to see this film again and again,fantasy
first i need to say i really like this type of movies super heroes scifi fantasy stuff for me this is entertainment not everyone fills the same so its important to consider this point before you can think i can be overreacting now the movie from all ive seen this was the one that really made it full you laugh you get angry and you even get sad but its only because the movie ended spiderman is also one of my favorites just now surpassed by this one the story from spiderman is more linear so here it might get a point but the thing is this is fantasy from the comics coming true on the screen like back then we were a child i couldnt have all the numbers so im not much into the accuracy i only hope this is a good start for a sequelhave fun watching this one you wont regret it if you are on the same page regarding my first statementregards,fantasy
this movie was absolutely a masterpiece of direction josh whedon literally knocks them out of the park again and again this movie has an opinion a vision and a determination to deliver on them in spades go see this movieits to marvels credit that they managed to pulled off the long windup of movies presenting each of the individual characters as well as they did even if its taken them a few tries on the hulk there choices of directors has been relatively spot on both for pulling off the individual movies but also to deliver enough stylistic continuity across all the movies such that they could eventually all come together in the the joe johnston ang lee louis leterrier jon favreau and even kenneth branagh almost unbelievably all did standup work setting the stage for this film of the bunch i personally think jon favreau really hit the nail on the head and set the tone for this movie with his stellar work on iron man and iron man 2kudos to the marvel team for sticking with it all and delivering a home run at the end of the series sidebar oh and hunger games was a complete and utter creative failure in both vision and execution compared to this movie in fact its quite a shame it was put out at all as it has now set such an amazingly low bar for what should have been the real deal  like this movie is ,fantasy
i took the whole family and the consensus was great movie the first 30 minutes or so seemed a bit slow to me and dark as in pass me the remote i want to adjust the brightness im a dyedinthewool downeyironman fan so the other characters left me a bit cold but the excellent oneliners and sfx kept me interested scarlett johanssen was impressive eye candy and her black widow persona grew on me neat little things the brief appearances of the new honda nsx and stan lee who i thought showed up at the end of the movie and said something like super heroes in new york city  ridiculous can anyone confirm it was him,fantasy
a for and a for amazing you may think this is an another one of those action movies  yes it is and one of the best and thats not it as it turns out the movie got more hits for its humor rather than its actionadventure combination yes a movie with a heart  fantastic work by the director and the writer for a concept as good as this every character is introduced with a background so it works out for the people who havent watched the other superhero movies a great job done by the writer who also gives a real emotional touch to the movie with hilarious dialogs which are also worth a round of applause  excellent job done by the acting team too hats off to robert downey and the animator of hulk  take a bow the real surprise package was cobie smulders who pulled of her role beautifully too overall im really proud i did not miss out on a movie like this  a funfrolic experience through out 1010 cheers,fantasy

while theres already literally hundreds on reviews of marvels the available on the web heres a spoiler free review for the thousands of us viewers yet to see the moviefor me may is month i bought my first marvel comic 76 in may 1970 and it was may 2010 that i was lucky enough to get my photo in 1 so although the movie opened here in new zealand on april 25 i waited until may 1 before seeing the movie with most of my family i tried to get in with my id the cashier thought it was cool but i still had to pay and i dont begrudge a single cent of the 1050 entry feethe premise of the as a team of fictional heroes is that the team is greater than the sum of its parts and this movie is a rare example where the same is true of the cast and crew with this movie everyone the director writers actors special effects designers have all hit their mark with hawkeye precision producing a new benchmark in action and comic book based entertainmentkevin fiege joss whedon and the rest of the crew have expertly delivered an tale for today that still respectfully pays homage to the 1960 comicbook origins of earths mightiest heroes while mixing with the best elements of the ultimate universe version of the heroesfor those who think they know the story from all trailers and tv spots think again there are still surprises aplenty from the very first scene through to the end and there is not a single wasted line of dialog in the whole 142 minutes contrary to the speculation that there would be no room for character development with so many big name stars and characters in the room at the same time there are many introspective conversations that progress the story and the characters reprising his tony stark  iron man character robert downey jr is clearly steals the show and his interactions with pepper cap thor loki and bruce banner include many laughoutloud moments tim hiddlestons loki is even more likable as a villain than he was in thor samuel l jackson gets the opportunity for more onscreen time and we learn more about his motivations and methods it was very pleasing to see chris hemsworth thor chris evans cap clarke gregg agent coulson and stellan skarsgard erik selvig all behave incharacter with their earlier appearances in the cannon of movies that culminates in the and it was like picking up the next issue of an epic limited series as an aside marvel has released a limited series prelude furys big week that helps tie the movies together and provides some background informationmark ruffulos portrayal of bruce banner differs from eric bana and edward norton but it is in a way that adds to the dynamics newcomer agent maria hill played by cobie smulders has a bigger role than expected and again adds to the contemporary relationship with the in the printed medium the battle scenes are well choreographed with a sense of panelbypanel progress and the thor  iron man  captain america conflict pays obvious homage to the big three and elicit memories of standoff and primein fact every character has their chance to shine in solo action pitted against each other and eventually against the common foe that no single superhero could withstand scarlett johanssons black widow character comes out from the shadow of the bigguns and she and jeremy renners hawkeye earn their place on the team theres plenty of visual humor too especially from the hulk and the collective gasp from the audience at the unexpected death scene is evidence of the emotional bond between characters and viewers im sure there some diehard fans that are lamenting the lack of hank pym but i cannot honestly think of anything that would have made this movie better than what it was in short this is the movie equivalent of the kreeskrull war that no marvel or fan should miss truly outstanding  cannot wait for the bluray for christmasand then theres the midcredit trailer  roll on 2,fantasy
one word amazing period joss whedon has done a wonderful job the effort he and his crew put into the movie is overwhelming and evident ive never seen a superheroes movie being so hilarious uncanny intelligent all together this has bettered all the previous incarnations of each character notably the hulk thor and captain america the script is one of the finest that ive seen in a superheroes movie and so are the screenplay and dialogs the one liners are the best especially the ones from tony stark and oh how i totally loved watching the hulk literally smash everything to pulp you know what this is just bs go watch the movie seriously no amount of words can take you to the level of awesomeness that the set go watch it i am for the third time this week,fantasy
since everyone has talked about the good pts quite lengthily already let me share my thoughts on why it still fell short of my expectationsdidnt get what loki was up to with the whole alien invasion plan i mean whats his endgame assuming they win when it seems the aliens are in it for themselvesspeaking of the aliens theyre just too inept and posed almost no threat at all other than the sheer size of their army even black widow thrashed a number of them when i was expecting the skill level and strength of these invaders would at least be capt america level capt america now theres a character who was just embarrassingly poorly used i felt like he was being bossed around by everyone when in the comics he is the true leader the scene where all of sudden he was giving orders to everyone was just trite i mean where was this even coming from never showed any true leadership qualities for a good 2 hrs of the movie and now hes calling the shots couldve been better developedand the team after fighting and arguing the whole time i just didnt see a good enough plot device for them to get their act together for the big alien battle it was just too abrupt for me wo any clear progression from individual issues to being integral members of a team and the death of the agent as a trigger cmon thats just lame there was no emotional investment for anyone on the team to decide on what happened next other than widow and hawkeye who barely worked with the guy the rest just didnt have anything much to do with guy even ironman for that matter i think what im driving at is the transition how these superheroes should have evolved from individuals to being members of the team begged for improvementminor gripe though ruffalo did pretty well i think the part wasnt as well written hulkbanner character was just confusing he attacks widow  thor and next thing you know he develops compassion camaraderie and heroic tendencies plus this banner is completely diff from the norton banner in terms of how he was written cant imagine norton referring to hulk simply as the other guy and in that manner was just so out of character for medont get me wrong i did enjoy the movie great action scenes just wasnt too thrilled with the plot and story they could have taken a page from the animated movie ultimate now that was tight story that the live movie could have been even wo giant man  wasp,fantasy
as a kid whos grown up reading everything about the and collecting their posters comics the head gears i had very high expectations from this movie and this movie stood up to its reputation brilliantly made excellent direction the graphics cant be described the best part is you cannot judge which actor was better because all them gave their best and since there are arent any references to the past so anyone who hasnt seen the earlier movies would still be able to understand every detail i dont really have words to describe how the movie was because it literally blew my mind ive already seen it twice in the same day the movie has all the elements of fun and is a total package but from my side i would have to say tony stark and bruce banner were the stars of the movie must watch movie people will regret it if they dont see it,fantasy
the by many people called the movie of the year the epic combination of all the creatures and superheros who have had their own movies during the last decade one thing is for sure the film has visual effects quite a lot of them and by a lot i mean a lot in almost every scene theres some cgi whether its a gigantic hulk or a flying ironman two and a half hours of thrilling action stunts huge floating ships creatures from another world and more so i think i speak for everyone who has seen this movie that visually this is one of the best movies ever made its a great movie to watch on the big screen in 3d with a bag of popcorn on you side the people who created the world of the have done an outstanding job its really overwhelmingbut theres so many so many fights so many stunts so many creatures al packed into one movie if you erase all the effects and the action theres nothing left the dialog is lame and cheesy the characters are flat and boring the plot is simple and predictable it doesnt leave you thinking and its certainly not surprising and intuitive i only cared about the characters because i knew them from previous movies theres no real character development because the action is the most important aspect of the movie yes the movie has its funny and shocking moments but really emotional or deep it never goes it remains flat and focused on events and action until the by the way epic conclusioneverything considered i would say that if you loved the previous superhero movies and want to see how they come together and love visual effects you certainly dont want to skip this one but dont except a masterpiece smart dialog and deep emotional scenes just lean back and maybe get another drink,fantasy
this film is one of the most distinctly average film i have seen in a number of years the action and comedy good as it was was there to simply gloss over a basic strong line normally i like my simple action films but just lacked a little somethingspoilers what i liked  the comedy throughout the film was pretty good myself and the audience laughed throughout  the opening might have gone on a little too long but it did well to set up the film  action sequences apart from the end which i will go into further details nextwhat i didnt like  story should have been better a bit more depth was needed in the whole story and characters bruce banner hulk was reluctant to join the mission but there was nothing that really showed it effecting him  last action sequence lacked magic i never felt myself really caring about the or what happened also the end when iron man was hurt all hulk had to do was make him jump i felt thor shocking him again would have been betterit is a decent film for a sunday evening but as an actual spectacle it was a small let down,fantasy
the unites iron man downey jr thor hemsworth cap america evans and bruce banner aka hulk ruffalo along with black widow johansson and hawkeye renner to stop loki hiddlestonthe good effects are good there are a couple of actually funny jokesthe bad characters are flat and just spend time joking or arguing rather then actually developingaction sequences are tedious monotonous and unexcitingmost jokes are cringeworthy one even made me consider walking out i didnt but i wish i hadby the end it feels like it didnt really do much of anythingi dont understand how the has such high ratingsthumbs down,fantasy

i want to try to keep this brief because i feel there is need for three separate reviews for this movie so without further adokids  youll love itnow leave the room and let me talk to the adultsnext comic book geeks  why am i even sharing this with you you saw the movie over half a year before i did but then what if you were like me and wanted the hype to die down first or your expectations were feeling a little strainedwell in case you havent seen this movie the dances provocatively between two different marvel universe molds namely 616 and the ultimate universe no reason just because somebody said sam jackson could totally be the black nick furyin all without having everybody dressed as they should be  in their original respective battle uniforms  everybody pretty much is as they should be but the three characters youre going to appreciate the most are iron man thor and hulkbanner theyre just so much better portrayed and their parts are so much more intriguing than fury black widow and hawkeye who in recent years has actually been one of the more interesting characters no matter what universe were talkingyou will get to see your favourite characters kick ass and interact the way they most likely would and there are a hell of a lot of injokes and references to appreciatenow please leave the roomokay movie fans and fellow snobs if youre anything like me too much noise and activity makes you sleepy rather than lively especially when they try to make superheroes act and fight as humanly realistically as possible before just deciding aaah feck it and turning them into mortal kombat character animationsin fact you know what feck itpros1 joss whedon directed marvellously and gave us his best 2 character interplay is at many times very fun to watch 3 the film does not rush from scene to scene like phantom menace trying to pretend right in front of your eyes that it is not in fact happening 4 the backing cast is superb 5 there is a hell of a lot of bang for your buck and it is mostly excellently executedcons1 hawkeye fury and black widow seem largely useless 2 you can tell the actors know it 3 captain america comes across as a bloody weakling and spends more time doing acrobatics and being depressed than he does take charge and kick ass 4 the population of new york city are mindless sheep with no presence heart or meaning and therefore have no reason for us to care that the are rescuing them from an alien invasion 5 the alien invaders didnt have enough time to prove how big a threat they really were before started stomping them wholesale this kind of defeats the object of them being a threatthis film however has the potential and i know that joss whedon is a perfectionist that will improve with every sequel i look forward to the next filmps  mark ruffalo best actor and best portrayal of banner there has ever been,fantasy
like allot of people in the world and i mean allot disneymarvel did a great prequel for this movie with the movies hulk thor iron man iron man 2 captain america so off cures everyone wanted to see them all in one movie even it thoughts characters would just stand in 1 frame holding carrots it would be an awesome movie but this movie doesnt stay there it really is an amazing movie by itself loki thor brother is leading an army of really bad alien creature thingys  i dont know exactly who are they ok   against earth and then all of earth mightiest heroes suppose to work together to fight them  ok so its not the best story they could think of ill give them that but i mean  each and every charechter in this movie is interesting enough to hold a movie by itself and seeing them all together is brilliant the soundtrack is fantastic its not just another soundtrack but a real afford was put into it to be focused for this movie if it wasnt clear by now the acting is really cool i personally think thor is really convincing as  well as thor from the comics but really theyre all great there was allot of acton as expected from this movie maybe i would take the movie a bit more seriously i mean doing more epic things in it but really its just a tiny thing in a great movie by far the best movie i saw in 2012 yea even better then batman i could talk about it for days but really if you still didnt watch it then run to the cinema and see it its a must ,fantasy
take that transformers thats how you show a city under attack with heart action pacing special effects fun excitement characters to root for humans to empathize with and most of all legitimate comprehensivenesscrossover films are rare but im a fan of them freddy vs jason did a great job of bringing two of my childhood favorites together in 2003 nine years later the didnt really bring together my favorites but it sure as hell put very good characters in a fantastic actionadventure superhero filmaside from some secondact pacing problems and an insipid villain with extremely questionable and blurry motives the movie worked extremely well with huge unique and deafening explosions some of the best 3d ive seen  and im hugely critical of that format large action sets fairly good score and cinematography deep characters and a whole lot of humor further everyone with the exception of hulk had equal sharing time on screen sadly hulk had only two scenes albeit they were worth it they blew whatever the previous two entire movies based on his character out of the watervery nicely you wouldnt have had to see the previous six or so marvelavenger movies  they were extremely crafty reintroducing them and their individual backdrops with swiftness but if you had see the other films like i have they included everyone you loved from before including a cameo from someone i prayed would be in this hint initials ppduring a secretagency shield experiment with a mysterious blue box of the gods evil and jealous brother of god thor loki strolls into our realm and is hellbent on ruling earth i guess its time to assemble earths mightiest heroes for the avenger initiativeof course like creator stan lees brilliance displayed over the decades these arent your normal superheroes they have depth and typically are individuals not playing well with others hence a good portion of this film is a boxing match naturally there are reasons behind this as well furthering the overall depth of the epicwill the avenge earth i dont want to spoil it but youd really have to be blind not to know i can definitely say they each uniquely kick ass in their respect rolesprobably thanks to or in conjunction with good direction these actors knew their roles and had them down pat with the exception of newto the seriesmark ruffalo as dr bruce banner each one of them again with 80 equal sharing time were pitchperfecti always love robert downey jr and especially in his iron man role and if you did too youll be laughing and marveling at his performance all over again same with chris evans who was great as captain america and really had his character pegged chris hemsworth as thor and samuel l jackson as nick fury were good and even though jackson had to tone down to the pg13 he was still badass scarlett johansson was awesome and still gorgeous and jeremy renner was a lot of fun to watch again recently he was wonderful in mission impossible  ghost protocol and hopefully hell continue the trend in the fourth bourne film later this summerfinally mark ruffalo has always been an actor ive admired and i think he did fine here and oodles better than edward norton the last dr bruce banner actor but i still think moviewise that is eric bana has been my favorite bruce note i said bruce because bill bixby will always be the best dr banner everexcluding lokis horned and silly godoutfit i actually bought their costumes and this is saying a lot for a movie that i previously scuffed at the sight of the funny blue captain america uniform and when he donned them in the film i feel right into it i believe thats thanks to evans who was so great that it never occurred to me for him to have anything else oni believe the overall movie elevated itself higher than what couldve happened with a premise of assembling multiple superheroes and story lines that said the special effects were about 90 fantastic with the remaining percentage devoted to the awful outofworld and in space aliens surrounding the hohum and dull villain they had the same problem with the original thor movie and on the dcside green lanterni wanted to rank and rate this movie higher especially since i had an absolute blast laughing my ass off and was captivated with the action fun but in addition to what i previously wrote second act pacing problems laughable aliens and bad villain it also had the clichd goto idiotic idea in the very climax i downgraded it a bit still i awarded it 45 stars and cannot wait to see it again preferably on imax againsee it  even if youre not a fan of the superhero franchisesnow bring on what i really want to see the justice league movie,fantasy
this movie was lot of fun to watch i never seen the captain america or thor movies before so there sowhat knew to mei liked the fact we had some time with each different superheros before come together i really liked how the movie flowed  it not nostop action all way thoughtthere were calmer scenes in this movie that i found interesting and they didnt drag on to long to make boring but action sequencing was outstandingfirst time i have actually liked new hulk i was huge huge fan of old hulk i have never given this hulk a chance not fan thor thought i cant seem to be warn i may need to see his movie next see more his back story same for captain americathose actions were edge of your seat stuff and lots of stuff going on at the same time i hoping for better ending then this movie got they all go on there separate way for the own sequels lol i looking forward to sequel i wonder if they add other superheros in the mix 810,fantasy
the assemble in uk and ireland pits together the protagonists of marvels properties iron man downey jr captain america evans thor hemsworth and the hulk ruffalo in an optimistic neverbeforeseen or attempted ensemble the reasoning behind this get together the god of mischief hiddleston has set his sights on earth with an extraterrestrial army at his disposal and earths peacekeeping organisation shield simply cant contain the situation without major help why did it take 50 years for this film to be madethe film starts with the threat loki gathering his army from an unknown benefactor and readying himself to once and for all take his brother down oh and to conquer our little blue planet nick fury jackson doesnt like this not one bit important side note the interesting thing about the and part of the reason its so successful is that its part of a much bigger story this is correctly referred to as the marvel cinematic universe it has five yes five prequels that lead up to the this has made us love the characters before weve even seen the in a group dynamic back on track being the director of the worlds most secretive and powerful organisation he has contacts each of these being superpowered well not all of them heroes that come in all shapes and sizes being a huge comic book fan just seeing these guys in the same room gave me goose bumps shields top agents black widow johansson and hawkeye rennercome along to join the fight to only for one of them to be turned into a bad guy kill loads of his colleagues and give the bad guy the object he was earlier hiding from the forces of evil delaying the assembley starks selfishness and arrogance annoys and pushes apart everyone maybe even more than loki does caps goody goody oldfashionedness doesnt impress anyone except coulson gregg thors sleeveless pointbreak appearance is nowhere near as impressive as it is in his own film black widow and hawkeyes vague yet uninteresting relationship bores the hell out of you and the hulk the hulk is the best thing about this film when i heard that mark ruffalo was cast as bruce banner i was a little skeptical to say the least the incredible hulk was okay and i do quite like edward norton however i seemed to like norton a lot more when i heard ruffalo got the handmedown part lets just say i was prepared for the worst another recasting however his performance was absolutely perfect as the nervous as for a good reason brilliant scientist bruce banner you can see that the hulk has turned him into a ever so slightly bitter man especially when you have tony stark poking you with sharp objects trying to get you to hulkout as banner you cant help but feel for him but as the hulk you cant help but laugh at his humour other actors whose performance deserves a mention tom hiddleston a cold calculating and interesting villain clark gregg fan favourite coulson robert downey jr oh he does play well with others who knew the chemistry of these fine actors is bliss to watch when they finally come together the story is great the vision of geekfavourite director joss whedon is a pleasure to witness this is what i say to those who said this film is too overcrowdedits not crowded enough with 6 future films announced and well underway this optimistic yet fascinating story is no where near ending and being a comic book fan im hugely proud to be a part of it the is a brilliant flick for everyone now im off to watch it again pros the tonybruce bromance the natural feel of the group dynamic the little easter eggs for those who were really watching hulksmashcons not once did anyone say assemble thors helmet looked awesome in his solo movie where is it same for caps uniform the first combatinfluenced outfit is miles better the way all the chitauri died phantom menace style banners sudden control over his anger although it was a sweet scenerecommendations for further enjoyment watch all of the mcu films in order research all of their easter eggs if you cant find the all and then finally watch again i guarantee youll enjoy it even more the second time,fantasy
hi readersi would recommend to stop wasting your time here reading this review and buy this movie right away i could not catch the movie when it was in the cinemas and honestly i regret it the movie is not only superb but is one of the best movies i have ever seen it will not be wrong if people call it the best super hero movie of the recent time featuring all the marvel comic heroes this one is a marvel in itselfcaptain america and stark iron man look amazing in their suits while hulk is much more balanced and thor is his usual self although the archer guy i still dont know his name   was new to me and i have not seen him before in any movie but loved his characteroverall a great entertainer which you cannot afford to miss,fantasy
not since the original superman in 1978 or even batman in 1990 or spiderman in 2000 has there been a comic book movie that so exploded like this one maybe it takes tenyear interims to produce blockbuster superhero movies i dont know there has never been a movie that picked up on the characters of several movies at once least of all from the comic booksuperhero genre loki ends up on earth after thor and discovers the tesseract cosmic cube from captain america he decides to uses it to conquer the planet but nick fury from iron man uses it to rally the hulk and the rest of earths mightiest heroes into protecting the planet it has more violence than the dirty dozen more wrecked cars than the blues brothers and more damage than any of the james bond films insurance rates in the comic book universe must be astronomical on manhattan its exactly like watching what you would expect from a comic book brought to life or of you could get into the world of the marvel universe except without the expanded universe characters like the shehulk and antman the movie never gave me a moment to catch my breath or tear myself away it is just that compelling filled with numerous memorable scenes thor battling iron man hulk batting thor tony getting his suit in midair hulk smacking loki around and numerous quotes ive got an army  yeah well weve got a hulk the movie and plot charge forward and never slows down its augmented by numerous strong performances given by an obscenely talented and gifted cast downeys swagger and gift for wry humor carries the incredible film as does tom hiddlestons machiavellian role as loki one of the most complicated personalities of the marvel universe mark ruffalo succeeds as bruce banner and the hulk where his predecessors could not there is not a bad performance in the entire movie not even from stan lee in his hitchcockian traditional cameo or jeremy renner in this his first comic book film its had to believe hes the same guy who played a slacker obsessed with drugs and alcohol in national lampoons senior trip the really deserves to be called the greatest comic book movie ever the only thing that could possibly have made this movie anymore awesome would be including cameos of the cast of the fantastic four although justin timberlake would have to be the new johnny storm tobey mcguire as spiderman ben affleck as daredevil and hugh jackman as wolverine and maybe dean cain michael keaton and charisma carpenter as superman batman and wonder woman the only bad thing about the movie is that the dvd is totally lacking in decent bonus features all of which are unfortunately held hostage on the bluray whats up with that why am i being coerced to buy stuff i dont want,fantasy

i usually try not to read or hear too many reviews about a movie before i actually get to see it on screen but i must admit that it was really hard for me not to sneak a peek in advance at a few comments both on this website and on magazines most comments went from good to excellent in my opinion this movie is excellent the most commendable achievement is the fluid way the cast of superheroes were assembledthe way they were first individually introduced into the plot and then the funny dynamics they were eventually thrown into each character kept their peculiar aspects but at the same time none of them ended up prevailing on the others take stark witty fellow who cracks jokes every now and then add rogerslaw abiding soldier thor the god of thunder who is thorn between his will to protect the earth and his affection to brother loki who is plotting more than ever a way to enslave our planet take also a new version of bannerhulk brilliantly played by mark ruffaloand two characters black widow and hawkeyewho although only superficially introduced in the previous chapters of the franchise manage to add freshness and continuity at the same time to the original group the result is an absorbing and entertaining piece of work another aspect worth mentioning is the fact that the main focus on this movie were neither the cgi nor the sentimental statuses of the characters but the heroes themselves and the story involving them everything was clearcut and incisive 2 hours and a half just flew by and in the end i felt like i could have watched even more the acting in my opinion was great except for mediocre johansson imo worth mentioning are ruffalos and hiddlestons performances the first one because he managed to be a new bannerhulk by keeping the characters main aspects on focus the second one because well hiddleston is just a great actor downey jr evans hemsworth renner were also great in conclusion i vividly suggest watching this movie your money will not go wasted,fantasy
marvels the is a movie like nothing else its a movie that play a role as the finale from 5 different movies iron man 2008 the incredible hulk 2008 iron man 2 2010 captain america the first avenger 2011 and thor 2011 its a movie where you can see some of the finest and most popular superheroes of american comic packed together in actionheavy sequences for more than 2 hoursbut just like the other marvel studios movies the is simply a scifi action that purpose only to entertain the watchers with its flashy special effect and outrageous actionjoss whedon buffy the vampire slayer did a good job directing this movie every superhero get the same amount of role and enough background story although it might not necessary since 4 of em have their own movie so no one feel left behind the story is pretty standard with thor brother loki try to rule the earth by borrowing chitauris army which hell bring to earth using the power of tesseract hidden in earth the director of shield nick fury decide to run the initiative to collect the earths mightiest soldiers including iron man captain america hulk and black widow to fight against the global threat of course thor join the force later because you know he have responsibility for his naughty little brothermost of the movie contain heavy action sequences but one thing that i really like is the filmmaker try to show us that collecting these superheroes and force them to fight together is not always gonna work right they are however just humans with their own personality and ego the problem is when they finally settle their problems nothing more interesting happens in the movie i like action movie but maybe because theres too many superheroes movie out there and every one of em always using heavy special effects to destroy a major city of usa the action become bland and sometimes boring theres no jawdropping moments no tense no thrill its just the same america getting attack by the alien again movierobert downy jr of course steal most of the attention here hes the freakin tony stark mark ruffalo as bruce banner also act remarkably the rest of the cast is pretty standard yep including the badass academy awward winner samuel l jackson tom hiddleton as loki is good but seriously why the writers decide to make loki look very very weak hes far from threatening he can be easily defeated hes the main bad guy but he post no serious threat to the he even become part of the joke in many sequenceits hard not to compare marvels the with another big superhero movie coming out this year the dark knight rises but looking at how the come out i have no doubt that nolans the dark knight rises will kick the ass,fantasy
well the movie was as i expected full of action  i found this movie much entertaining when i put this movie in action movie categories of the movies ive seenbut when it comes where you expect the complete movie with a good script nice direction nice action and everything a good movie needsat somewhere in the movie you will feel like something like this was seen in some old movies and thats what i hate about this movie ie the script of this movie is not feels like a freshly new written scripti am giving it 710 just because of mind blowing action  and for the punch that hulk hits to thor ,fantasy
when an unexpected enemy emerges that threatens global safety and security nick fury director of the international peacekeeping agency known as shield finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster spanning the globe a daring recruitment effort begins  c marvelthe is good not great the film does its job in entertaining the audience but not much more it has some great action scenes some truly funny moments and some drama but overall it cannot be compared to the top superhero films which includes the incredibles the dark knight and spiderman 2 for me its a popcorn flick and if thats what youre expecting then youll be satisfied as a joss whedon fan i expected much more from the film than it just being entertainingi felt the whole dysfunctional family aspect could have been executed better and expanded to be a more significant portion in the film there was only one scene where the tension between the superheros can be felt but thats about it the film also could have used a bit more heart as i felt the whole team working aspect to be lacking in the emotion area additionally the story seems to be overdone by now villain wants power and tries to take over the world maybe something different would have been more engaginghowever apart from those flaws the is a good film the key success is due to the superheros themselves and how effectively whedon manages to balance each of the characters without having one overshadow the other out of all of them the hulk played by the talented mark ruffalo is my favorite he seriously has some of the most memorable moments in the film robert downey jr is great as well as of now downey pretty much nails his role as the egotistical yet charming tony stark black widow played by scarlett johansson also gets some great moments in here which is good since shes the standout female character in the film however i felt they could have done more with captain america and thor additionally although hes utilized better in this film than in thor i wanted a different villain than lokioverall the is a fun popcorn flick that starts the summer season but not with a big bang as i hoped for the film could have used a bit more external conflict between the superheros as well as more emotion however the film doesnt take itself too seriously and the 25 hour running time really flies past you before you know it think of it like a better version of transformers 3,fantasy
this film is overrated critics are calling this the best comic book based movie ever and im just not feeling it to use an analogy from the film is an ant batman nolans version is a bootthe positives of the movie are the humor lots of lmao moments the action scenes and i just love seeing these heroes on screenthe big negative was the plot particularly the plan and motives of the antagonist it didnt make sense why loki needed an army from another realm to conquer earth when he seemed to be doing fine on his own with that staff of his and manipulating people while loki seems to have no problem traveling back and forth to earth and other realms why cant the space army use the same worm hole he uses the rules of the game are unclear why is it that loki can blast captain americas shield and knock him off his can but when thor strikes caps shield it seems to have less impact on cap than lokis blast how is thors hammer able to hold down the hulk but when the hammer is laying inside shields ship it doesnt drag the whole ship down or fall through the ship when thor is trapped inside that room falling toward earth why cant he use lightening to open it up how does thor when he is supposed to be cut off from earth after the events in thor know that loki took the cube and just happens to drop in on the ship where lokis held captive how is it that nick fury can touch the cube in the beginning of the film yet we see in captain america the first avenger the red skull opens up the cube by touching it in fact why is loki going through all this trouble to open up the cube when skull seemed to do it effortlessly while the rag doll scene was funny how is it that a god with all these magical powers can be slammed around by an earthly creature and affected by iron mans blast yeah the government has this brilliant idea of using nukes to protect the rest of the world without even thinking about firing nukes inside the worm hole where the threat is coming fromthis film is good if you turn your brain off i found it funny enjoyable and exciting to watch although i was glued to my seat and will probably get it when it comes out on bluray i am not eager to see this movie in a theater againso this is far from the best comic book movie ever made i saw nolans movies multiple times in theaters it lacks any depth and originality to claim that title maybe it would at least be arguable had they plugged all the plot holes in the script batman is the boot that steps on the avenger ant theres the dark knight batman begins and then everything else,fantasy
there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people so when we needed them they could fight the battles that we never could nick furywith all the blasts and bullets of the theres enough humanity and humor to win over even this jaded film critic although im tired of american cinemas pervasive graphics and violence six heroes saving the world from an alien invasion in this outstanding scifi are as satisfactorily flawed in character as they are superior in strengthdirector joss whedon masterfully balances the egos not least of which is samuel l jacksons nick fury the sheild leader whose long leather coat is second only to his awkward eye patch loki tom hiddleston returns from asgard to fight his half brother viking god thor chris hemsworth of the lightening and hammer and five other super heroes for control of earth everyone is smart in a way and weak in another for example if genius scientist dr bruce banner mark ruffalo gets angry enough he becomes a giant green monster hulk and a swell job ruffalo does at that tony starkiron man robert downey jr with the very metal suit is dangerously loose with his toys and his women but his banter is firstratemartialarts maven black widow scarlett johansson joins as well as hawkeye jeremy renner whose archery skill is matched only by katniss in the hunger games black widow and hawkeye probably were added to the group for sex appeal and comicbook accuracy they all end up fighting for the freedom loki denigrates in the beginning of the film the battle of the box office they already won with almost 200 million in european receipts before opening in the states who said crime doesnt paythere is no throne there is no version of this where you come out on top maybe your army will come maybe its too much for us but its all on you because if we cant protect the earth you can be damn sure well avenge it tony stark to loki,fantasy
first i rated this movie a 10 back in 2017 as during that time i was still brainwashed under the mcu i thought they were prefect ill keep 1 as 1010 instead of giving it a 610back in 2012 i was mcu hyped and practically worshiped the mcu and praised movies like 1 at the time in 2012 1 i felt was the greatest thing evernow in 2019 after my views on 1 and the mcu has changed completely mcu is not that great and 1 even for a first take was pretty generic where it still has unanswered plot holes 1 is good but its overrated to a point only little kids brainwashed fans like i was and fanboys would be ignorant to the flaws and worship a movie like 1 and other mcu filmsmcu and the 1 ruins its self with lack of characterstory development under used villains weak heroes and pointless jokesrecommendation watch this movie for fun while drinking a beer or some food with a lot of sugar otherwise you may get brainwashed like i was in addition if your will power is weak dont watch this movie or any mcu movie,fantasy
i watched twice times  first time 2 years ago  may 2012  and second time 4 days ago  november 22nd 2014   the point that i dont like is almost characters talk too much in only nick furys center  where is too lonely and too boring  make me sleep right now but i still try to watch  but the perfect point that i love is the battle between thor and iron man  hulk and thor and captain   and the final battle with full team  the most important point is i can know a personality of each characters and the friendship between heroes  so  the maximum mark i can get for this film is 70  i hope  age of ultron will be better than this film   i am vietnamese so my english is bad  i hope you sympathize for me ,fantasy
the is a brilliant take on the marvel comic series that were made in 1964 the is worth watching i can say money well spenta war breaks out on earth and its good vs evil as the battle for the fate of the earththe is a epic film which is one of the if not the best comic book movieit made records taking in 623279547 beating harry potter and the deathly hallowsit was shocking that the did so well as it was partly a disney film and people thought it wouldnt do wellthe was one of the blockbusters of 2012 beating others like the dark knight rises and the amazing spider manthe is overall a brilliant film and i recommend that everyone should watch it,fantasy
many people give the bad reviews because it has too many superheroes but heres what they need to realize  you dont walk into a theater to watch the a movie thats supposed to have multiple superheroes without realizing its supposed to anywaythis movie had a lot of action good humor and great acting what are people thinking giving this movie bad reviews just because one thing was hokey  how loki got out of that place he was stuck in maybe if they saw the postcredits scene to thor they wouldnt mind as muchwhatever is running through the heads of the people who rant on this one i can think of something that will turn their argument around if not turn it around at least make the argument a tie was a great movie bottom line,fantasy
on may 4 2012 many marvel fans were on the edge of their seats and i was one of those fans i can say that our expectancy for the new movie the was through the roof and we would not be happy with anything under five stars marvel had promised the initiative would return and from that point on it had been a waiting game however combining all of the super heroes into one great team yet each holding their old attitudes had to take time the wait was well worth it though marvel really dished it out they produced a movie that i could watch over and over again and never be bored the cast was wonderful and i cant say that there was a single actor that did not play their part perfectly the movie was full of action and there was never a dull moment in the humor however if you have not seen the other movies leading up to it you may find yourself lost in some parts the plot was phenomenal and was accompanied by visual effects that put you inside the movie itself i would highly recommend this movie to everyone it is entertaining humorous and overall a blast to watch some of the characters showed their true colors in this movie more than in their own productions one of my favorite quotes in the movie being captain americas thoughts on thor when he says there is only one god and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that aside from my thoughts one actor that really deserves a round of applause is mark ruffalo as the hulk through the movie he acts seamlessly from the doctor straight into the hulk and back if you want an action packed movie with an all around amazing experience i would definitely recommend the to you,fantasy
im gonna say this to every hater and naysayer who calls this film overratedi love this movienothing will ever change thateverything in this film worked for me the characters are all greatlove the visuals the best ive seen since the original star wars filmsa solid storygreat villainand the best experience ive had in the theater in a long timei literally jumped out of my seat with every action sequence in this moviewhen the finally assembled i geeked outit was a great momenthulk definitely steals the show at the endi enjoyed the dark knight rises but it cant compare to this filma fast pace and well worth the waitmy 4th favorite movie of all timeby the way iron man is my favorite avengeran excellent superhero movie with so much rewatchability,fantasy
the best comic book movie yet very well done in linking the single hero story lines together for this ensemble even at a run time of over two hours i felt there was no down time in story progression or action the characters are well layered and performed and their interactions are greatly displayedrobert downey jr by far carries this film with great sarcasm and intelligence his inner conflicts would make him a great antihero but the character relies on his logic to see the greater good one of my favorite events is the death of agent coulson only because you can feel the loss from all characters and nick fury being the opportunistic leader he is uses that hurt to motivate a team that might not have exited without the tragedyoverall the movie is very well done and lived up to all my expectationslook forward to the sequel,fantasy
its a great movie but lack drama or more deep in the history you feel like you are missing somethingrobert downey jr is the best super hero actor spoilerthe good guys are very strong for loki they had to include another villain loki is very weak the last battle is very impressive but looks like the was indestructible spoilergreat audio great graphics effects great fun in this film do not see the in 3d see the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies,fantasy
simple eye candy where all matters of cgi are displayed on film sure it is the difference this time is that there is a real story albeit farfetched this film has the distinction to bring together many superheroes that have graced the big screen in recent years to pool their resources and talents to save the world from a terrifying menace that would reduce humanity to nothing more than an ant hill its the classic good vs evil battle guess who wins to its merit the film underlines the character flaws of these larger than life beings can one be complete sane when omnipotent the question had to be raised not my usual kind of film but effective it is noteworthy that robert downey jrs usual amusing presence raises the quality of the whole,fantasy
i had expected more from joss whedan but the aka marvels aka marvel assemble and various other permutations of this terrible title is just another superhero movie dull and hackneyed plot poor characterisation lots of fighting it provides plenty for its preteenearlyteenage male target audience  great special effects no romance and a very lengthy battle sequence at the end  but doesnt offer enough to adults to sustain interest for its 140minute length it is only saved from mediocrity by two factors the humour in the script and robert downeys performance i also credit tom hiddlestons performance as loki but the of the cast generally fail to shine even samuel l jackson cannot make a real character out of the bizarre administratorsoldier hybrid that is nick fury,fantasy
70 you say yep at best this was decent saturday morning cartoon fare high schoolers and college kids will love itand have in huge numbers but as a guy frozen in a 60s time warp much like austin powers i can simply say its just not my thing babythe movie is carried by the personality of robert downey jr as tony stark aka the iron man this is no surprise downey is naturally funny and amazingly quirky while still being attractive by contrast chris evans comes off a bit like chris mintzplasse showing up at your fraternity rugby partythe best acting award goes to powers boothe he has done other notable work but i always harken way back to 1980 and the guyana tragedy the story of jim jones no one else in this film acted much in the real sense of the concept they more or less played themselvesif you saw thor 2011 iron man ii 2010 or captain america the first avenger 2011 you have pretty much already seen the it was all the film they had left on the cutting room floor just taped back together along with some elements of the incredible hulk 2008 reincarnated ruffalonian style that is pretty much it this film is a bit like going back through your favorite scrapbooks it is nice to reminisce and relive the past but you are not going to see anything new,fantasy
for fans of the comic books its a dream come true for diehard action fans it something you have never been prepared for the sheer specialeffects and solid script work effortlessly and make this film work two characters i feel carry this film iron man  captain america the two have male ego problems conflict of moralities and this can be seen in the filmi have given a rating of 10 for special effects and script there are some actors that would have sunk this film if not for the majority of decent acting by both robert downey jr chris evans and samuel jackson for once in his life chris hemsworth does not fck it upthe liabilities in this film are jeremy renner scarlett johansson mark ruffalo but they just merely cause a dent in the armour nothing morebefore you see this film you should already have seen iron man 1  2 the hulk  the incredible hulk captain america the first avenger and thor this will give you a background into these charactersplot nick fury is director of shield an international peace keeping agency the agency is a whos who of marvel super heroes with iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow when global security is threatened by loki and his cohorts nick fury and his team will need all their powers to save the world from disaster other superhero theme movies the flash the flash ii revenge of the trickster the meteor man 1993 iman 1986 robocop trilogy the vindicator revenge of the radioactive reporter,fantasy
so if your wanting an awesome movie for the summer this is so far the number one to go see it starts off with a bang and doesnt ever leave you wanting much more even if you have never seen any of the solouperhero films in the past 2 yearsmovies it doesnt matter starts off with awesome plot and builds the entire time until the climax of the film happens and you will not even know when its going to start or finish if you like the other super hero movies this one will not let you down unless of course you see it after you watch the only other movie worth seeing this summer the dark knight rises only seen teasers for it but know it will be the number one movie because easily topping its predecessor the dark knight i suggest only two movies to watch in theaters this summer are the and the dark knight rises mr nolan will absolutely kill the competition with the best batman movies to dateexcept jack nickolson as the joker strong 8 out of 10 just because its a must see film this summer only film i have ever given a 10 out of 10 is true romance because it gives you exactly what you want from a film in every way you could think of,fantasy
the is an absolute must see movie with the amazing storyline and action packed heroes it is a top quality movie like no other the cast from the is the best actors for the characters what so ever and of course there can be no ironman without robert downey jr and chris evans is just right for the part as our favorite patriot captain america if i should mention one more actor who i believe did an outstanding job it would has to be a mix between tom hiddleston as loki and chris hemsworth as thor those two work so perfectly together and play the characters of the norsenordic gods better than i could imagine anyone ever will be able to if you have not seen the yet you should do your self a favor and buy it right now it is that kind of movie that you cannot live without having watched,fantasy
the unite to save the day in marvels newest action adventure film the this superhero group is made up of iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner nick fury samuel l jackson puts all of these super humans together when loki tom hiddleston thors brother tries to take over earth loki plans on achieving this goal by using the tesseract an energyfilled cube which was discovered in the ocean in captain america to bring alien invaders to earth in order to destroy the planet loki even casts a spell on one of the making him assist loki in any way possibleall of the unique superheroes are supposed to work together however many of their egos clash leading to several disagreements that hinder their progress with the task at hand it is especially difficult for bruce banner under these circumstances to keep calm and not transform into a giant green monsterthe special affects are quite impressive but the main plot is noncreative it was clever to incorporate iron man captain america the hulk etc into one movie yet why would their job be to protect manhattan from an alien invasion like in so many other contemporary movies in addition even thought the script has classic superhero clichs it gets to be extremely cheesy i found myself laughing at many of the foolish linesmy initial reaction to this film was not a good one i actually couldnt wait to get out of the theater i was so bored and unimpressed after hearing all the hype about this epic movie and being let down after asking around ive heard mixed reactions ive done some research and reevaluating and now i give the a 7 out of 10,fantasy
this gets off to a slow start but it does end well,fantasy
the first movie is good and fun but to me is over rated i think nostalgia or something clouds this movie for them loki is a villain between good and eh for me iron man and coulsin are my favorite characters in the movie the 3rd act is good but the 1st and 2nd are a little slow at times fun movie but not as good as the other movies,fantasy
the movie was such a huge box office success that i tried really hard to like it i just couldnt just to be certain i gave it a second viewing and disliked it just as much the second time aroundfirstly if you havent seen thor iron man captain america or the incredible hulk youll have no idea who the characters are and what theyre all about there havent been films about black widow or hawkeye so they dont really matter anyway the film played like a medley of all of these super hero movies and didnt really offer anything we havent seen in these movies also due to way too many protagonists for one film none of them were given the opportunity to develop in fact i found all the characters incredibly shallow and didnt like any of them my favorite character in the film is probably hulkeverything about this film was so overblown and overdone to the level where nothing was believable  within the context of the genre off course the was so cgi heavy that it was difficult to have fun with it the film also had so many plot flaws and credibility issues everything was simply done for effect at the disposal of an interesting plot iron man is just as annoying as in his own franchise although he is the deepest character of all so a mere mortal in a suit tony stark iron man can actually outwit a god like thor wow not much hope for gods the same goes for the powerful god loki who is outwitted and outsmarted so easilythe action in dragon wars and transformers was a lot more realistic and more enjoyable than this ive seen it twice and thats more than enough thanks,fantasy
a nearly perfect popcorn movie who cares what it plays because its so fun characterized characters glamorous stars endless jokes intense and stimulating rhythm shocking audiovisual effects and clearcut plot arrangement each superhero has his own personality and story they are busy fighting each other and bullying cute girls together why do these actors so loveable,fantasy
really did not like this movie not sure why its getting good reviews meant to tug at the heart strings and to a degree that works but takes two incredible characters thor and hulk and completely misses the mark portraying thor as a lazy slovenlythis film was a wretched excess too many things going on too long more characters just means you have less time for the characters you live in my opinion you can lose chris pratt antman and give more time to spidey,fantasy
completely shocked at how bad this is thought marvel did a great job with infinity war with character development and tying the story all togetherendgame is the exact opposite back to the cliche terrible jokes no character development focus on the worst actors almost no screen time for all the most talented members of the new marvel castback to the drawing board required for next moviei think anybody giving this a 1010 must either be 4 years old or a bot paid for disney to automatically give 1010 genuinely awful film so disappointed,fantasy
the movie is kinda boring and feels 2 long if you watch it againloki is an overated villan the movie was way 2 longhulk was the best thing about the movie,fantasy
have seen this so many times now but what a movie its a test of a good movie that late at night if your flicking through the channels you find yourself watching it even if you have seen it so many times beforei am a proper comic book fan so to see my comic heroes transform into blockbuster movies is just something else prior to this i had been somewhat disappointed iron man was ok but captain america was a kind of fun but boring and thor was perfectly cast but quite poor hulk was well hulk and a shambles the tho was a wow great action great interaction between cast a new awesome hulk and what a villain in tom hiddlestons loki the final 45 minute manhattan battle was simply superb this movie really did re energise the franchise got phase 2 loved it,fantasy
as superhero movies go its a good not great but good movie but the hawkeye character boring with no personnality jeremy renner looks like a guy in tights going to a halloween party hes fat out of shape and marvel uses a double for the arm sequences so we might think hes muscular fail like could he disappear and never come back like never see him again in a movie i dont know like send him on an island with noah ringer,fantasy
 1 is a movie with a meh art style and sometimes it feels to slow the characters are good but actually are stereotypes of themselfiron man the plaboy arrogant inconsequentcaptain america the man who always remembers that hes from 20th centurythorthe ignorant manseeing the heroes is action is awesome the story is solid and the villain is the best part tha action is wonderful and the cgi holds up well and is even better then most of the marvel superheroes moviesand characters really evolve as a team,fantasy
faced with an existential threat posed by asgardian renegade loki tom hiddleston nick fury samuel l jackson assembles a team of earths mightiest heroes including ironman thor the hulk captain america black widow and hawkeye robert downey jr chris hemsworth mark ruffalo  cgi chris evans scarlett johansson jeremy renner respectively lokis plan revolves around possession of the tesseract the same glowing blue macguffin that plagued captain america in his debut solo film captain america the first avenger 2001 the disparate team of egos and alter egos meets squabbles reconciles and finally cooperates as the skies open and lokis chitauri army attacks the big apple all of the heroes super and otherwise are well played and fun and tom hiddleston is excellent as the conniving loki the overall story is entertaining and the film especially the climactic battle very well made all in all a good start to the complex story arc at the core of the popular and profitable franchise,fantasy
the assembling of the comes together almost flawlessly,fantasy
they had this great idea of making a movie about probably every marvel charactersuperhero from the comics and until the came out they presented quite a few just to name some iron man robert downey jr hulk mark ruffalo captain america chris evans and thor chris hemsworth  they all are part of the ensemble in the gettogether thewith estimated 220000000 of budget you get to see how far the cgi department has come its insane insanely goodabout the plot its decent the villain is decentand there are so many more marvel movies to come after this one what a franchise,fantasy
this is the first mcu movie i ever saw and this one got me invested it was a little longer than i expected but it was really entertaining there were a lot of elements taken from the other movies that help string all the movies together i did have a few issues this was longer than it needed to be and the first half was a bit too informationdense the second half though more than made up for it the action sequence and the visual effects were amazing all the characters were assets to this film the humor the bonds between the characters make the movie special this was deeply enjoyable,fantasy
marvels the is a memorable movie for marvel studios and through the world unlike dceu justice league 2017 film i like when the heroes gather together as one and successfully save the day,fantasy
i never thought i could become even more of a fan of joss whedon but he managed to do just that he and the fantastic cast successfully gave life to all my marvel heroes filled childhood dreams well played,fantasy
a repost from an old imdb reviewim happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way its not that anyone needs to see those other avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development this also allows them to probe deeper into the characters personalities this heightens the tension so often missing from comicbook movies and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing the result is a film thats just flat out exceptionalof course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly what i loved is that marvel did it again with their main villain loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie spurned loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption he always keep people guessing and again thats just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief he has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity you have somebody whos capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and tom hiddleston plays it like the master he has become this is oscar worthy villain performance goodthe performances in this movie are as good as any ive ever seen in an adventure film the great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis the rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other each of these great actors have such specific talents that its fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie i think whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths its just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event,fantasy
i like the movie okay and i thought id review it since i will be reviewing infinity war later the first movie had its moments but i do have some issues with the movie the main problem i have with the movie is the beginning the beginning of the movie is very slow and very boring in my opinion there is a lot of talking about things that dont interest me i did not care about the scenes with loki showing up on earth and attacking security guards and mind controlling people i honestly found that lame and uninteresting this movie just seemed to have no impact when it came to the action except near the end the movie does have some good action near the end during the last 45 minutes which i enjoyed however i was so bored with the first one hour and fifteen minutes of the movie that the last half barely makes up for it in other words if the action at the end had not been so good i probably would have not liked the movie if none of that great action had been in the movie then i definitely wouldnt have liked itso yes i think its an okay movie but it could have been so much better if the first hour and fifteen minutes of the movie had not been so boring and slow to be honest i didnt even care about black widow meeting the hulk scene i thought i would like that scene but i really didnt im not saying there is no action near the start of the film there is but they are small bits that last maybe two minutes tops and im sorry but thats not nearly enough action considering this movies status i expected a lot more than a couple of lame twominute fights with black widow and these men who i dont remember that just goes to show you how impressive those villains were i dont even remember them im guessing im alone in that of course people probably love that scene im sorry but i definitely didnt im surprised that this movie gets a higher score than age of ultron which is the superior movie in my opinion im sorry folks but more things happen in age of ultron that movie has a better story and better effects and better action scenes even the fight scenes with the smaller robots were great that movie was shot very well and everything worked perfectly for me with that movie even the ending was better and far more entertainingthe first movie on the other hand was not as good as the second the first one suffers from very bad pacing and uninteresting character moments that could have been better dont get me wrong i liked all of the characters i thought the six heroes were very likeable which is one of the positives of the movie they also make a great team and work well together the only problem i had with them was their humour i did not find them that funny they had a couple of funny moments but most of their jokes were hit or miss for memost people seem to like the scene on the shield ship when all the characters were standing around talking im sorry but i didnt like that scene i thought that was one of the most boring parts of the movie in fact i remember watching that scene and feeling very bored and tired i nearly fell asleep too in fact i feel tired just writing this review because it was definitely boring at times loki being on the shield ship did not make the movie more interesting either the man who plays loki is a great actor and his performance in the movie was very good however even his good acting didnt stop me from being bored and thats mainly because by this part of the movie one hour has gone by with nothing happening the twominute fight with black widow doesnt count that was nothing also the start of the film with the agents chasing loki was nothing either it was a lame threeminute scene that went nowhere and ended in a crappy waythe only other action scene i can think of that happened before the boring ship scene would be lokis lame speech at the party scene after giving a longwinded and boring speech about wanting to rule the humans he gets into a lame scuffle with captain america which was nothing special either captain america got his ass kicked and had to be saved by iron man who shoots a laser beam at him which leads to loki surrendering and the taking him to their ship which then leads to more scenes of nothing special if people think the standing around arguing on the ship is entertaining they can be my guest i just disagree i would rather watch age of ultron instead which has 100 times more action than this movie ultron is also a better villain than loki in my opinionthere is a scene on the ship where captain america walks off by himself and tries to fix the ship and i must say that scene is very boring that scene goes on way too long and it was totally pointless and a waste of running time if you took that scene out of the movie it would be ten minutes shorter and faster paced and more fun because of it you also have a lame scene where this guy or guys i dont remember because it was so boring were firing bullets at captain america and he hardly even puts up a fight he just hides around a corner and uses a piece of metal to try and block the bullets that scene was laughable and very lame captain america pretty much spends that whole scene hiding and everyone is okay with that for some reason sigh and people call ultron lame im sorry but ultron is not lame captain america on the other hand was very lame in that sceneyes i know i have probably pied people off by saying that but im sorry its true there was nothing special about that scene captain america put up a better fight against ultron then he did against this nobody guy who i dont remember and ultron was a machine captain america put up a great fight against ultron but for some reason he struggles to fight a nobody guy that is 100 times weaker than him why i have no idea once again sigh and ultron is supposedly lame i think the people that call him that must be high on crack or something because they make absolutely no sense ultron was a great villain that the struggled to fight against and they only managed to beat him in the end because they all fought him together it was about 10 against 1 which isnt exactly fair so of course they are going to beat him that does not make him lame i think people are forgetting he nearly destroyed the worldgetting back to this movie which is the weaker movie its a very slow one that did not impress me that much most of the movie is all talk and no action when we finally get to the fight scene with thor vs the hulk about an hour had gone by which is way too long dont get me wrong i liked the fight i thought thor vs hulk was entertaining and the fight was pretty evenly matched the scene was also well shot with good effects so yes the movie does have action im not saying it doesnt have action but the problem is it just takes too long to get to the action pieces thats one of the many reasons why 2 is miles better because that movie moves faster and it is not sluggish like the first movienow getting to the good points of the first movie 1 the acting the acting is very good and everyone gives good performances especially tom hiddleston who plays loki he does a great job not only acting but playing a good and believable villain i can totally understand why people like him i like him too i just dont think hes the number one villain thats allmy personal top three best marvel movie villains would be 1 thanos 2 ultron 3 loki thats just my opinion and i know im probably alone in that sorry but i had to be honest getting back to what i was saying the acting was great by tom and there were a few times that his acting was so good he came across as intimidating especially during the scene where he talks with black widow2 another thing i liked were the effects now im not saying they were all great some were just okay but others were very good and i was impressed i personally liked the cgi that was used for the aliens they looked pretty real to me3 the characters yes despite my moaning earlier about the boring scenes the movie does have a lot of likeable characters the main ones being our heroes i just wished our heroes could have done more at the beginning of the movie instead of standing around talking or arguing with each other however when they are not arguing and they are getting along they are actually very likeable people and i grew to like them pretty fast i also liked their teamwork and how they worked together at the end of the movie4 now getting to the best point for me personally the action during the last 45 minutes of the movie the last part of the movie was very good the moment loki and his army of aliens come along and start attacking the city thats when it gets very fun and entertaining there is a lot of action and a lot of chaos buildings fall people run away screaming and we get to see our heroes kick the aliens asses we even get to see thor fight loki again which was cool the entire last part of the movie is good my main issue with this movie is the first hour and fifteen minutes being boring and slowif people praised this movie only for the last 45 minutes then i could understand the praise it gets but i dont understand the praise for the whole movie i did not enjoy the whole movie but i did like some short moments near the beginning those moments being too short was the problem i also enjoyed thor vs hulk and the best part of the movie the fighting an alien army which i enjoyed the mostoverall the movie is just okay to me i have seen many other marvel movies that i have enjoyed more i only liked the movie okay and its worth one watch for the action at the end but this is not a movie that i would watch many times considering the pacing problems it has,fantasy
marvel has proven itself they made people care about thor iron man and captain america they built up this massive interconnected universe which is all leading to one massive movie the entire future of this franchise laid in the hands of this movie did it payoff obviously it did but why why did joss whedons blockbuster become the 3rd highest grossing movie of all timemarvel and whedon had a lot to prove with this movie they had to prove this massive gamble they took with a connected universe was worth it and they didthe cast played a big part in this seeing iron man meet the hulk and thor fight captain america was awesome their personalities all played off each other excellently with rdj leading the charisma meter hulk was recast for this movie with mark ruffalo a worthy replacement for norton he makes the character his own this is the first movie i really started liking black widow johansson gives a great performance and her writing is great jermey renner does good for what hes given which isnt little but he shines in the next movie tom hiddleston does great as loki with his few comedic moments being highlights samuel l jackson is great as fury and clark gregg really shines as coulson the cast is great not a single person is miscastthe writing is good with quips galore it sets up the epic battle at the end excellently and the character interactions make the movie a few characters feel wasted though evans and hemsworth both do amazing but they feel underused hawkeye is famously shoved to the side and thats a real shame the opening twenty minutes are pretty boring but the movie picks up after that but i think its still very well writtenthe effects are all great they finally got the hulk right he looks like banner just ripped and green caps suit sucks though iron mans suit looks life like the alien army looks good everything looks greati love this movie ill never forget watching this movie for the first time and being utterly astounded marvel had crafted a masterpiece in my opinion and i thought this was it if only i knew how truly epic this series would get910,fantasy
the is a science fiction film that on the one hand tries to create an environment for the world of superheroes metanthropes and mutant and on the other tries to transmit indirect messages to the audience no one can deny the fact that people have worked so hard to do this but poor direction and bad editing montage etc have created a bottomup result but of course the actors interpreted the roles they gave them and thats why they deserve congratulations,fantasy
the is a movie i really like and i think it a good filmi mean it,fantasy
this is a very good movie it has a great story line it also has great acting it also has great special effects the age of ultron is better but still this is a great movie i give it 9 out 10,fantasy
the main thing to say about the film is that it is its lighthearted touch and robert downey jr and others delivering fasttalking one liners which break just at the right time some of the humour comes from the battle for screen supremacy among thethat said while the visual effects and stunts keep up viewer engagement imagination does tend to lag behind  the fighting is repetitive cgi is used well but some of the cartoonish manouevres made by the hulk character in a film trying to keep some semblance of scientific plausibility are frankly implausible compared to the other tom hiddlestone gives good menace with wide piercing eyes and an almost sibilant line delivery but he plays second fiddle to the prime villainy who are featureless,fantasy
in order to appease the gods from his planet loki tom hiddleston steals something known as tessercat from a company called shield in the right hands tessercat can be used in a good way for the good of mankind but lokis plans are much more sinister and he intends to create a gateway from another dimension to earth and plans to take over the world nick fury samuel l jackson is the director of shield who finds himself having to call upon the best superheroes in the business collectively known as the to put a stop to loki and his devastating planas someone who is a general fan of superhero films the assemble was always something that appealed to me and gods knows why its taken me so long to get round to seeing it i have to admit that with a 5 star rating and the big draw of seeing several superheroes together my expectations were high and whilst the film didnt quite deliver as i expected it to it is still a very good filmit cuts to the chase very quickly and wastes precious little time before it gets to the high octane action sequences which is fine by me and carries on in this manner for a good 45 minutes or so the initial setup shows us being introduced to the characters but the introductions are generally met with either frantic fight sequences or cheeky banter  sometimes superhero films can introduce characters in a lengthy and dull way but it doesnt play out in this manner here and for the most part the film is often exciting fun and enjoyablewhere the film does suffer slightly is in the middle of the picture specifically where loki is caught and imprisoned whilst i get that this section of the story ultimately served a purpose it does feel like it has been tortuously stretched out and feels out of place with what was otherwise a fastpaced and exciting filmas is to be expected in a big film with lots of superhero characters the acting performances prove to be rather mixed tom hiddleston does a reasonably good job but i didnt find him all that intimating and his attempts at being threatening were at times somewhat laughable hemsworth is a good physical presence but doesnt give much of an acting performance i havent seen any of the thor films yet so will reserve my judgement on him till i seen those films johansson is ok but doesnt have a lot to work with evans acting is generally ok but he finds himself playing the straightman to downey jr which doesnt really work that well i much preferred evans as the goofball character in the fantastic four the true standout performance for me was mark ruffalo he managed to give banner a real human quality and sold it so well that i still saw a human being beneath the gruff green exterior  i thought that the hulk was actually the best superhero character here but his introduction is laborious and as a result of this he is a little underuseddespite some of my objections i have to give credit to joss whedon because to all intents and purposes the film has plenty of fight sequences occasional moments of amusing banter and for the most part it is lively and fastpaced yes it isnt perfect and its 5 star rating on sky movies and its current 81 rating on imdb seem a little out of kilter with reality but the assemble did entertain me big time and thats what truly matters when all is said and done,fantasy
easy to understand infinity war as a new x x oven people only pay attention to the ostentatious luxurious expensive and commemorative aspects of it that forget the inherent weaknesses and this is just a tool to pull the purse of the audience to the following products to revive what it deathto make it easy to understand the marvel blockbuster is just a movie with a watch for fun factor when a series of superheroes die will be resurrected and the event is considered as never happened if this time you do not know the 4 is the sequel and revolve around the time to revive the members the error you do not read the newspaper onlyinstead of bringing a big battle like what the trailer promotes the work is a long patchy story that lasts more than two hours the russo brothers decided to split the superhero into a series of small groups that made the plot fragment and destroy all previous productswhy not just last year marvel spent 130 minutes and  180 million for thor ragnarok so that thunder chris hemsworth can control the power without hammer odin anthony hopkins also asked a sarcastic comment are you thor boy or thor thunder that thor then spent more than half the amount of time in the infinity war just to find the new hammer and never use lightning once and groot vin diesel hugged the phone boringly throughout the movie just to make a hammer for the audience to shout and forget that the storyline or even this character is no problem nothing,fantasy
the is an entertaining and satisfying film i was worried that with so many characters the story would be messy or rushed but everyone seemed to get equal time and the plot flowed smoothly this movie mixes pulsepounding action with sharpwitted humor and it does it well  but who would have expected less with joss whedon at the helm,fantasy
thisthis movie here is by far one of the most memorable movies to date the battle of new york was a whole event i could look away from now that got me the most attention,fantasy
 is an awesome superhero film and every adjective loud brash kickass applies all the actors gathered do a good job either against one another or against a blue screen the action is top notch and you might get a bit woozy even with all the stuff that happens on the screen this is a movie event and it should not be missed under any circumstances must watch superhero extravaganza,fantasy
id watched some of the films preceding this one and enjoyed most of them captain america thor iron man and even hulk and was curious about the next installment plus joss whedon of firefly was directing this is easily my favorite of the films and its one of the best superhero films on the marvel side the xmen films were decent but they couldnt come close to this id say the are my favorite superhero alliance when it comes to marvel comics iron man and captain america really stole the show with iron man being the most realistic superhero since batmanbruce wayne plus that aerial aircraft carrier youll see what i mean when you watch go for it,fantasy
the movie reviewthe is a beautifully made fantastic film with great direction writing solid acting and performances the film is an epic masterpiece in the genre of comic book superhero films the visual cinematic style of the film is absorbing and the story telling is top notch the film immerses the movie goer in the adventures of the and it captures superheros in all of its glorythe tone and style of the movie is intense gripping futuristic and imaginative the visual effects of the film are spectacular and dazzling action sequences are highly creative artistic and breathtaking the humour and emotions in the film feels compelling convincing and genuinely realistic there are some very interesting character moments the character designs of the film are very fascinating and quiet innovative the star cast is great and the performance are strong the characters are very well developed and have emotional depth and intensity the musical score of the film is amazingmark ruffalo totally nailed it as hulk he is freaking awesome as hulk robert downey jr as iron man is amazing and charismatic as always and tom hiddleston as villainous loki is fantastic and outstandingsome of the best dialogues of the film is delivered by robert downey jr as iron man sometimes films lacks proper pacing and feels little rushed at certain points and looses momentum in some sequences but all over its one hell of a superhero ride i had watched the in cinemas and had a great experience for me watching the all our favourite superheroes get together for first time on screen is a an unique and very memorable emotional moment the is one of the great superhero film by marvel and a fine addition to already growing marvel cinematic universe the is definitely one of my most favourite superhero film of all timeplease note that this review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film and does not represent others thank you,fantasy
when a revolutionary power source known as the tesseract is brought into operation something goes wrong it is meant to bring unlimited energy from outer space but instead it is used by the evil loki to teleport himself to earth using his powers he steals the tesseract and takes control of scientist dr erik selvig and shield agent clint barton he intends to give the tesseract to the other in exchange for an army to conquer earth first he will have to gain certain items to open a large enough portal for his army meanwhile shield director nick fury assembles the worlds superheroes to battle loki they arent natural team players and are soon bickering and fighting amongst themselves loki is captured with surprising ease almost as if being captured was part of his planif you are a fan of the superhero genre then im sure this will be a must see if like me you arent exactly a fan of the genre but do enjoy the occasional superhero film then this is one that is worth watching the fact that it includes several varied superheroes is rather fun having only seen the iron man films and the old 70s hulk tv series i wasnt familiar with most of them but that didnt really matter as it soon becomes apparent what powers each of them have and the reason for those powers isnt really important there is lots of action throughout this is all pretty exciting and the technology they use looks great i particularly liked the helicarrier a flying aircraft character reminiscent of the cloud base in captain scarlet only this one is introduced to us when it is in the water even on a fairly small scene the climactic scenes look good but would recommend watching on the largest screen you can to get the full effect the cast does a fine job making their unbelievable characters believable overall id say this is a fine example of the genre that is suitable for all but younger children,fantasy
everything that the marvel cinematic universe was culminating to leads up to this and it certainly doesnt disappoint except storywisewhat made the previous marvel films compelling was how they managed to write a unique and realistic story that became the primary focus of the films rather than the overused herovillain structure watching tony stark grow from arrogant billionaire to humbled hero torn by war watching bruce banner suffer with his internal jekyllhyde in a modern society watching thor odinson learn from earth and become humbled and finally seeing captain america use his sense of duty to the us to cope with his new superhuman powers the mcu films most attractive feature in my opinion was the storylinei felt marvels the strayed from the characterdriven storyline the main conflict and growth in the film is getting the heroes to adjust their agendas as a team but a majority of the film is also dedicated to the action the oneline jokes and the special effects spectacles that take up at least a third of the film with the we get a fun movie that diminishes the realistic take on heroes that the previous mcu films employed and puts more emphasis on the comedy and epic spectacle that is the film theres much less room for the typical character development and storyline that we came to love through the mcu while its amazing to see these heroes finally come together on the same screen and work as a beautiful team the story falls flat to a basic heroesfightvillain structure,fantasy
one of the most entertaining blockbusters of all time the may not have the perfection of the holy grail of comicbook adaptations ie the dark knight trilogy or logan but its significant emphasis on perfect balance of humour  action throughout its runtime makes up for a highly rewarding experience that is far greater than what most films of its genre ever manage to come close tosix marvel superheroes in one movie same savetheworld bullshit that we have seen  been disappointed with countless number of times and yet the works in an unexpected but very effective manner and is bigger better  far more amusing plus enjoyable than all the previous films of the marvel cinematic universe combined and succeeds in surpassing all hype  expectations with surprising but stunning easeas for the plot summary when the tesseract suddenly activates at the shield research facility and opens up a portal allowing loki brother of thor to reach the earth  begin his mission of enslaving the whole planet nick fury director of shield reactivates the initiative thus bringing natasha romanoff dr bruce banner tony stark  steve rogers together who are later joined by thor  clint barton to stop loki from succeeding with his planthe direction is extremely good as joss whedon has crafted an impressive piece of eyepopping action extravaganza and to make sure that the film is not overloaded  tiring filled it up with loads of humour the screenplay is witty plus the comic timing is brilliantly executed cinematography  editing is carried out amazingly well and the original score by alan silvestri is a major plus as it strikes the right chord from start to finish thus enriching the whole experiencecoming to the performances its robert downey jr who delivers the strongest performance amongst all as tony starkiron man and thanks to the amazing wit charisma  charm this amazing actor always brings to the screen with finesse its almost impossible to not like him yet the one who manages to steal the show in the end is none other than mark ruffalos terrific rendition of the hulk for he was absolutely merciless  unstoppable and even tom hiddleston as loki manage to impress with his chilling performanceon an overall scale the is an ambitious adventure for the masses containing all the right ingredients of a genuine blockbuster material and the best thing about it is that nothing gets overdone as every element is present in its right dose be it action humour drama etc an astonishingly great initiative that will satisfy the majority of its viewers with its wildly entertaining funfilled roller coaster ride this is the perfect popcorn entertainer for all ages,fantasy
so back when the marvel cinematic universe started up every preceding film was leading up to this moment the assembling every character had been fleshed out already save for the fact that hawkeye and black widow were only supporting characters in some of the films and the hulk had been recast and the stage had been setthe tesseract from the first captain america film is the mcguffin of the film desired by loki who is portrayed brilliantly by tom hiddleston once againin terms of the story its nothing groundbreaking or original but its still entertaining this ragtag group of heroes must band together and save the world from extraterrestrial threat while trying to remain civil with one anotherfor the most part this film is an absolute spectacle comic book fans had been dreaming for a film like this where these iconic heroes team up and save the dayjoss whedon succeeds in giving us a memorable superhero film of course there are references in the film that will inevitably build up to future sequels which in a sense gets a little tiringother than that this film really is a testament to the effort of those involved in the mcu,fantasy
and remarkably brilliant the action is dazzling the whole movie through and the story escapes somehow to the usual plot of this kind of movies all goes around the tesseract an energy source and who has got it or is trying to loki an exiled norse god takes it and tries to use it to control or even destroy earth with the help of and extraterrestrial army of evil soldiers the only solution shield an agency aiming at earth protection envisages is to put together a team of legendary heroes to fight that threat but these heroes captain america the incredible hulk thor and the iron man are not exactly at the beginning very friendly to each other so their conflicts must be first appeased before they enter in action as the to fight earths enemy then the action develops itself in overwhelming fights collective and individual of astonishing and appalling quality until the final defeat of the bad ones chiefly the final scenes are excellent indeed this is one of the best movies of this kind ever made,fantasy
there are movies that surprise the audience and get a smashing success so unexpected even up to its makers especially the budget not so generous studio and names in the cast who supposedly would not be able to attract a large audience there are however cases of productions that since there is the news that will come out of the role of expectation are surrounded by everything around him big stars big budget and with an almost certain success at the box office it is this second option that fits the a complex project that had the responsibility to unite all the worlds own superheroes of marvel gathered at the same time and same place making the characters interact with all their differences and similaritieswhedon and zak penn may perhaps be placed as the true heroes of this great gathering of superheroes the script is developed in exact measure knowing incorporate various elements references characteristics and situations of comic characters as antagonistic in a precise dose of action humor and technology if you think about it the task of the writers was nothing simple gather all the big superhero films presented in their soil in previous years to fight a villain with potential to wipe out life on earth would even join a norse god who lives in another dimension a monster irrational and powerful a billionaire egomaniac a super soldier dormant for decades a skilled archer and a spy fatal and deadly all these characters living in the same space and time having to deal with different personalities motivations and skills towards a greater good as if that were not enough the villain would have to represent a real threat large scale and immediate to justify the gathering of notable fightersone of the factors that help in the design of the plot is that there is no need to introduce the characters since the task of establishing the characters in the films was made of individual heroes thus the action is played on the screen directly from the first minutes divided into several large sequences of all kinds heroes vs villains heroes v heroes heroes vs chitauri in addition to the struggles between the components of the the joss whedon film has great action sequence blocks idealized in different places in the first few minutes we see loki coming to earth and a large following of escape from the labs of shield entitled to chase through the streets through a tunnel and a helicopter and culminating in a huge explosion at the base of the agency in the soil soon later we have to pass in germany and even a huge sequence that goes on in the shield ship occupies large space in the film forcing the heroes to understand after a discussion to save everyone on the ship of a large and devastating onslaught of enemies led by loki until finally the worst happens and the must face the chitauri to invade earth after a portal is opened in space just this last sequence occupied almost the last 40 minutes of the film the best is the domain whedon conducting the action scenes while maintaining the interaction and dynamics between all the heroes making the story move forward as the action scenes were being shown everything was getting bigger and better both in the duration of the fights and in its technical complexityin a film of such monumental scale is essential in the preparation of flawless harmony effects made by industrial light  magic which earned the film a well deserved nominee on the oscar for best visual effects with an estimated budget is  150 million and filmed almost entire green screen highlight the meticulous construction of the nave of shield and the other ships that attacked her in airspace creating impressive 3d features and more human than hulk the creation of stark tower the construction of an entire city with hundreds of buildings skyscrapers and moving cars which incidentally is also all created by computer creating detailed chitauri and giant space monsters that also pass the portal plus countless explosions shattered glass dust and objects flying through space the certainly used what is most modern in the area of visual effects in a complex in the extreme importantly working together with the formidable team of sound mixing we can hear the sound of arrows explosions glass shattering and the impacts of the objects on the floor with a clarity and realism detachablejoss whedon manages to merge with uniformity plenty of action humor through dialogues fast and truly entertaining and manages very well a huge amount of characters in the scene simultaneously the director with his influence television planning frameworks with very many closeups and planes closed open but knowing the right moments with beautiful and exciting plans long sequence especially in the final battle against the chitauri he also looks for references in movies soil of the protagonists the is without a doubt one undisputed success of critically and commercially becoming the third highest grossing film of all time surpassed only by titanic 1997 and avatar 2009 both by james cameron the production received positive reviews from critics the review aggregate website rotten tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93 with an average rating of 8110 based on an aggregation of 267 opinions on metacritic the film got an average rating of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews signifying generally favorable reviews an adventure filled with elements of the essence of the comics without worrying too much about the realism presented focusing on a simple plot and the best a popcorn movie has to offer,fantasy
this a movie i quite enjoyedit hits all the right buttonsintense action sequencescheckfunny one linerscheckgood actingcheckthere wee a number of moments through where the audience cheered and clapped loudlymost of your favourite marvel superheroes are herethere are too many characters to list herethe hulkmark ruffalo is one of my favourite characters in this filmhe gets some great scenesthere is some fun interplay between hulkbruce banner and iron mantony starkrobert downey jr which i found very funnythe action is off the chartsthe acting is really goodas wellone thing i really like about the films in the marvel cinematic universthere is almost always a scene after the end credits start rollingfor methe is a 810,fantasy
back in 2008 before nick fury told tony stark that he wanted to talk about the initiative during the postcredits scene in iron man no one had ever expected that marvel studios would be able to do a film adaptation of the nothing like it had ever been done before and yet they made it work they took their time establishing its heroes in solo films in order for them to become endearing characters and then they came together for a superhero epic unlike any other at the time joss whedons thewhedon known for his snappy dialogue and credibility in geek culture gives this film so much in terms of humor and epic character moments that feel like they came straight out of the comics it may be a large cast but whedon gives each member of the main team yes even hawkeye enough to do within the context of the story they work off each other extremely well which results in some truly epic and in some cases hilarious moments eg when hulk completely decimates lokinow sure admittedly the plot for this film is pretty darn basic a bad guy tries to take over the world and the team up to stop him it really isnt much more than that and yet in this case thats not that big of an issue the still stands as one of the most important films in the superhero genre not only was it a film that very much lived up to the hype that came from all of the buildup in previous films but it was pretty much the one that truly established marvel studios as the kings of the superhero genre,fantasy
marvels the flat out brings the fun back into comic book films dont get me wrong i love the nolanverses darkness and depth and iron mans introspection but those movies arent fun in the basic sense of the word the beauty of the in contrast is that it doesnt take itself too seriously and despite the large cast the characters somehow gives them their due individual justicein this league of heroes seeking justice poor choice of words i want to highlight captain america and black widow in particular the latter fits surprisingly well in the 21st century and cracks quite a few good jokes as any 90 year old would black widow with her increased screen time compared to iron man 2 comes across with more agency of her own instead of pure sex appeal though that is surely there too i can also note that while i enjoyed edward norton as the incredible hulk i prefer mark ruffalos humor and think he deserves an film of his ownloki in his first appearance since his debut in thor provides a wellbalanced and somewhat empathetic villain who i think he will be a mainstay in the mcu for as long as it continues finally you can see some of the reallife issues of accountability that become the basis for future films in the seriesthe deserves 4 out of 4 shawarmas,fantasy
so marvel finally decided to bring all its superheroes together something that i had been waiting for from a long time until now there were only independent stories for each of the superheroesthe directed by joss whedon is the very first movie from marvel that unites all the heroes into one great action packed movie the movie brings iron man robert downey jr dr bruce banner aka hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson together to save the earth from the actions of the norse god loki tom hiddleston the story is similar to other superhero movies with the general save the earth from danger plot even though it may have a simple plot however it does have some amazing action sequences and impressive special effects like the much more realistic hulk who through motion capture technology finally looks like the actor playing him the interaction between the superheroes as the movie progressed was also something to watch out for it had great performances by all the actors good humor and many others which i will leave as a mystery is a general scifi superhero movie but it sets the stage for more eyecatching sequels to followaccording to me what whedon and marvel have created here is one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet this movie is a must watch for the marvel fans out there i would give it a rating of 910,fantasy
this was a long anticipated movie that teams up multiple superheroes for the first time and confirms mcu completely the last five mcu movies have all be leading up to this and its here now so is it goodi like it that they tried making a comic book cinematic universe and teaming up all those superheroes in fact i love that idea and it got very good ratings and i liked the movie it was fun it was well done the dialogues were well written and it was so cool to see all these heroes working together and also alan silvestris score is very good and its one of the best superhero movie themes ive ever heard but the story the similar problem i had before just wasnt big or epic enough it felt like a special longer tv episode with huge budget the plot was just too simple for such an epic idea and most of the main plot happens in one day its not messy at all but thats because of the thin plot and even when there are in danger there are still humorous parts so when there are some emotional moments they dont really fit in there is a death of a side character somewhere in the middle and everyone is so sad about it but i could barely remember his name so it did nothing for me but its not about the actors the acting is great and everyone shines in their roles but i still liked tom hiddleston as loki the most also there is a recast of one character hulk hes played by mark ruffalo and i think hes also pretty good in his own way ruffalo is closer to the comics but nortons grounded approach was very good and it shows us how badly affected he is with his gift and one more flaw enemies were to easily defeated in my opinion aside from lokis plan and all the fights between them in the first half the never really faced anything that was a really big threat and they got out of every danger too easilyvery fun very well done movie and the first superhero team up movie and thats way it gets so much points from me but i was just slightly disappointed because of the lack of challenge to the heroes and the weak plot,fantasy
im writing this because my profile checklist needs this sorry good movie by the way full of humour thrills and a great cast of characters all of which impel this visual effectsdriven spectacle whilst i had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly what i loved is that marvel did it again with their main villain loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie spurned loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption he always keep people guessing and again another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie ,fantasy
good incredible special effects action sequences and just a thrilling ride throughout robert downey jr is a great actor with lots of charisma and i dont even like iron man captain america has a lot of appeal as well banner is good too what this movie lacks in serious depth it makes up in acting and aestheticsbad as usual of marvel films the humor is misplaced and at times excessive it makes the film lose its seriousness and the sequences are no longer gripping and that scene where hulk randomly smacks thor is that supposed to be humorous it makes no sense whatsoever and adds nothing to the plotverdict i would definitely recommend it its just a enjoyable film to watch,fantasy
the story is very entertaining and truly gripping however you have to see the story of each superhero beforehand to understand better the plot itself the movie is really actionpacked and very cool to watch what makes the movie even better is probably the fantastic cast i was happy to see that most of the heroes were played by the same actors it was a kind of old boys reunion the characters were true to themselves it was easy to recognize them and they also kept their sense of humor the acting was totally convincing the action scenes and the visual effects were absolutely mindblowing ive never thought that it was digital characters for one second even if i knew it all the digital tricks dont look obvious if youre absorbed by the movie you forget them very fast so to conclude the movie is worth seeing and if you love superheroes youll never be bored,fantasy
words can not describe how much i love this movie over the course of his career joss has always exceeded my expect ions from buffy the vampire slayer to firefly to dollhouse and cabin in the woods each of these films and tv shows carry so much depth the was nothing less then that it had comedy loki and the hulk it had tender moments the death of one of their own a little mystery but most of all it had a compelling story line one that never was dull or over the top you really wanted these heroes to succeed you felt for them which if so difficult to accomplish with so many big named stars with big named characters are all in a movie together yet i always felt that each person got the right amount of equal screen time except ironman he had the most time but he is also the greatest comic character of all time so bravo to you joss for succeeding in another brilliant production i cant wait to see what he does with the second movie,fantasy
the elders say that two is company anything more is just a crowd shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas with an ensemble star cast a fast witty script thrilling action sequences and masterful direction it is the perfect superhero movie one which will charm not only the nerdy fans but also the uninitiatedthe project began over 10 years back when marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first each of them were characterized by action humour and a certain degree of insaneness the movies generated big bucks at the box office but i always felt marvel was holding back something whether the grandness of plot or the scale of action this is what it was saving for no holding back for the 220 million mother of all actioners 6 superheroes one mental norse god a full scale alien invasion this one has got it allthe story picks up plot strands from the previous movies loki steals the tesserect a cube like artifact which is a source of great power which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade earth post credit scenes in the older marvel movies show that nick fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day where the earth will be hilariously out gunned and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team to form an unbeatable squad each superhero gets something to the table hulk brings the muscle captain america brings strategy ironman brings style and technology thor brings emotion along with godlike fury hawkeye brings steely sincerity and black widow brings smokinghot sexiness but before they can take on loki and his minions they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team much of the films uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes the climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last years transformers dark of the moon but is infinitely more enjoyable each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team each sequence bettering the previous one the movies biggest strength is its star cast robert downey as ironman continues from where he left off in ironman 2 billionaire playboy genius philanthropist he calls himself as he lends sarcastic humour to an oh so serious group chris evans as captain america might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity chris hemsworth as thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil while jeremy renner and scarlett johansson as hawkeye and black widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the ateam however the scene stealers were mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk and hiddlestons loki ruffalo is probably the best hulk to grace the silver screen and while edward norton and eric bana played the role with intensity ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humour trust me with or without pants the hulk will keep you in splits but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the hulk delivers the coup de grace to loki lokis expression immediately after priceless  speaking of whom the star of the movie is loki a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain think joker in the dark knight or doc ock in spiderman 2 and in hiddleston plays loki in a manner that man to man he stands head and shoulders above the heroes this loki like most super villains has a sinister single point agenda to rule the world and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him in of all places germany notsolongago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world when loki is captured and held in a glass cell he gives a little bit of the hannibal lecter treatment to scarlettyou do a far better job if you love what you do and director joss whedon is a certified geek having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series the biggest input that joss whedon brings is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it hold on he seems to say the solution is just round the corner it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously unlike the dc comic adaptations is a celebrity jamboree of sorts and yet whedon manages to give each star his place each character his due weighs in at 146 minutes but to his credit whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout whenever things begin to sag jokes punchlines and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong to sum up is a superlative effort mixing fantasy science fiction imagination colourfully dressed hemen this is the film marvel fans have been waiting for ages they took their time but they delivered on all counts this is a no holds barred effects driven mass appeal blockbuster par excellence absurdly entertaining these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in asgard for geeks such as me and will sure extend its magic to the non fans there are so many characters yet it never felt too many production values are solid the script engaging with loads and loads of nonstop action geeking out has never been so much fun,fantasy
after a superhero thors evil brother loki gains control of the tesseract he becomes a threat to earth the director of shield nick fury organizes the superhero group known as the to stop himthe was produced by joss whedon the movie came out in 2012 the is a very exciting movie with really good fighting scenes in it the movie is about loki and his army fighting against the for the tesseract in new york city the tesseract is an unlimited energy power source shield found the tesseract deep in the ocean at the same time when they found captain america in the ocean loki having the tesseract would be very dangerous to earth so nick fury got the together to stop him the consist of iron man captain america hulk thor black widow and hulk eyein the movie i liked all of the special effects the backgrounds music and sound effects were also good the graphics in the movie were also very good and made the movie bettera major theme in this movie is heroism through out the movie the members were trying to protect every one on earth since the movie takes place in new york city there were many people who lived in new york city who could have been hurt but many of them werent injured at all because the protected them overall this movie is very good ive seen this movie many of times and i never get tired of watching it if you like action movies then i suggest you watch this movie you will love the 910,fantasy
when i rate movies and yes this review contain spoilers i usually have 4 main criteria visuals acting plotstory and entertainment each with around 25p each equal 10p in totalthe visuals and cinematic feel of this movie is very good this is great entertainment and visually great i give this a 2p the acting is top mostly and the chemistry between the characters is great also they give a good credence to the movie despite a week premise i give the acting a 20pthe storyplot is where this movie fails too many plot holes and i cannot wrap my head around lokes scheme what the hell is his plan anyway why get captured why not just open the hole and surprise everyone would be a much better plan i give this a 14pentertainmentwise this is one of the best made in recent memory there is always something going onusually with a great sense of humor and the movie feels very short because of it a 2pin total a strong 7 or a week 8 despite above i rate the movie on a 7 mainly because it lack a lot comes to storyplot this is very good entertainment and great fun and the freshness of getting the avangers together has an amazingly wowfactor but at the end of the day not so much of a movie as an actionsuperhero film this is great as film in general pretty average,fantasy
this film bought together some really good actors who really played their characters and got each ones message across although one issue that did seem to be apparent was the over all story arcit still followed the tried and tested method of villain comes in hatches an evil plan causes chaos that puts the heroes into disarray and just when it seems like all is lost the heroes manage to pull them selves together just in time to ruin the evil plans and save the world not really a spoiler but does kind of give you the theme of thingscredit should also be given to those that created the vfx for those familiar with how iron man gets in and out of his suit the on screen animation is amazing to watch and undoubtedly took ages to work out,fantasy
the good  one of my favorite comic book movies of all time it has amazing action scenes the one take shot that shows what each hero is doing during the battle of new york still makes me want to cheer great ensemble chemistry and a sense of fun that is supported by some dramatic tension it captures the spirit perfectly and builds upon characters that were introduced in the previous mcu movies hard to believe that the only major character that was given any kind of introduction in this movie was maria hillthe great  ruffalo pulls off the best bruce banner ever to hit the screen perfect blend of smart ass smart scientist and asshole and the hulk was wildly fun as wellthe surprising  of all the movies i have rewatched in this series this one seems to have been most impacted negatively by the future mcu stories mild spoilers ahead the death of a major figure loses some of its impact as you know he will be coming back and it undercuts some of the darkness and drama that my original watchings conveyedsummary  still amazingly fun and by far the best liveaction comic book ensemble movie ever made and worth watching again and again the has dc desperate to catch up and create their own dccu but i am not convinced batman vs superman will ever live up to this joss whedon created an experience that was an amazing way to end phase 1 and set us up for phase 2,fantasy
at first i was very surprised at how they made all the characters intertwine i really enjoyed it from start to finish leaving you with wanting to see more i believe this set the film and the following self titled films for success the cgi was right on top as i would expect from a film like this that relies heavily on it since going on dvd it was nice to rewatch it over and over to see things i missed the first time around the cast is spot on for each of the characters and makes me want more i really like the dialogue between the characters since this is the first time meeting them all at once i think it was well written introducing each and their roles a nice set up for the sequel,fantasy
this is the perfect superhero film you will not find much in the way of social comment one bit about loki  nazis is a bit clunky you will not find a great deal backstory or exploration of the depths of the characters but this film doesnt need those it is awesome and it is fun striking the perfect balance between dark and light in the pain vs fun sense no time is wasted on introducing the heroes or the villains it is assumed you know them already and of course you doand the pacing is perfect the action sequences are well done and pure comic book there is no slacking in the pacing but you do not get a lot of the whatthehelljsthappened too fast to follow action  that is the essence of it a comic brought to life in a way that you dont question the balance of the characters is right too starks smartass humour counterpoints captain americas straight guy perfectly and the swaggering thor goes well sided with the mild banner and brutal hulk hulk especially is someone who worries everyone in this unpredictable yet necessary he is a presence even when he isnt big and green sure there are some unbelievable bits if i had taken even a fraction of the punishment black widow does whilst fighting the bad guys i would wind up dead or very injured at best and the consequence of actions taken is not always carried through but hey this is marvel not tolstoy and it delivers the goods as they fit within that universe,fantasy
i watch this film multiply times since it came out i couldnt stop watching it and i kept watching over and over again when i see this film today i just realized it has some good moments and very well acted action scenes i felt at the second act of the film slowed down the whole film and i felt there was a rock on top of the and they are all just dragging it as it slowly goes on because has good scenes but the film goes from action and back to drama and goes right back to the action with no sudden reasons that once it goes back to the drama scenes it really does really drags on until the next action scene happens has good and funny moments between the characters i just feel that the pacing is very slow when transition to the next action scene to the next lucky age of ultron done the pacing a bit better but still has some scenes that drags the movie from continuing forward,fantasy
the is easily the best marvel cinematic universe film to date i would even go as far as to say that it is the best marvel film to date it was an amazing movie filled with great special effects and an amazing castthe movie opens and a voice is describing a powerful object known as the tesseract we later learn that this is an infinity stone one of the most powerful items in the universe we then see nick fury and dr erik selvig talking about how the tesseract is misbehaving which is not a good sign they believe that it is a portal to the other side of space and think that someone is messing with the portal on the other end which was suggested by hawkeye a shield agent out of nowhere the notorious loki appears through the portal and kills multiple agents he then takes selvig and hawkeye as mind slaves and escapes with the tesseract a few people try to stop him but they are unsuccessful he escapes and the title of the movie is announced after this sequence the movie goes on to nick fury assembling a team entitled the and they must learn a way to work together in order to thwart lokis scheme and save the world from an alien race called the chitaurithis movie is amazing it includes one of the biggest casts in cinematic history and mind blowing visuals just to give an idea of how big the cast is let me give you a list robert downey jr as iron man chris evans as captain america mark ruffalo as hulk scarlett johansson as black widow chris hemsworth as thor jeremy renner as hawkeye tom hiddleston as loki gwyneth paltrow as pepper stellan skarsgard as dr erik selvig and samuel l jackson as nick furyyeah thats a lot now anyways this movie has many ups and few downs to start the visuals are amazing in the film there isnt a moment where you might say fake all of it looks completely real these visuals are at their peak in the final battle known as the battle of new york in said scene earth is being attacked by a species of alien called the chitauri through a portal the portal is positioned in the sky directly above stark tower there are giant monsters flying out of the portal and superheroes clashing with them this scene looks completely real i felt as if i was in new york and was being attacked by aliens thats just how good and immersive the film wasthe second topic id like to hit would be the castacting the acting was amazing as listed above the movie has a huge star cast all of them being great actorsactresses the script also allowed for the characters to act different than from what they normally do ie captain america antagonizes others hulk doesnt like to get involved in fights etc these varieties of personalities are executed perfectly by the castnow that i have covered the main positives lets go over some negatives the main problem i had with this movie is the time spent getting the to bewellthe i feel that if marvel wanted a more accurate title they should have called it assembling the throughout most of the film nick fury and phil coulson are trying to get the to work together as a team they finally do agree to work together but only after phil coulson also know as the glue of the mcu gets killed by loki before the final battle goes down at that point we are an hour and thirty minutes into the movie and have been ready for some good action for awhile despite there have already been an epic fight between iron man and thorother than that however there werent any negatives this movie obviously has more yess than nos overall i would give this movie an a or a 10 out of 10,fantasy
now this is how you do a summer blockbuster the is a movie that not only throws you full blown special effects action and laughter but actually a little emotion too and that makes all the difference the story sees well the assemble bad things are coming toward the security of the globe and so shield gather together superheroes and the like to come to try and come to the rescue it may not sound like the best film through my explanation but believe me this is pretty epic as movies like this go the film only goes to show that superhero movies can be great and that special effects dont always ruin a movie every timejoss whedon directs this and writes this and hey does he do a good job not only does he make it thrilling and fast he also manages to let the movie never take itself completely seriously the jokes here and there and fantastic whedon also manages as mentioned to create a film that has these impossible things on show and yet they dont just look stupid i felt at first glance that this would look too over the top in the scifi department but really they actually work very well all the gadgets etc the action quota is thoroughly taken care of as well and yet again the fighting scenes have a little tinge of humour in there making this movie a whole host of thingsof course with such a big film comes a big cast and this movie throws stars at you left right and centre including such names as robert downey jr scarlett johansson and samuel l jackson to any person who has seen marvel movies beforehand then you will know a lot of the cast this movie is of course many other movies meeting on the same path as the acting goes it is hard to really spot who stands out above the rest everyone does a good job and no one lets the team down i particularly liked downey jr as tony starkiron man as he just breathes a lot of humour into this i was never overly sure on the role of shield in this and some of the cast who are in the organisation dont get the best lines exactly whedon does though manage to get agent coulson clark gregg to be pretty cool at timesi think the special effects here are pretty nice i mean come on the films budget is huge but its the way in which it looks that makes it feel different to other big blockbusters not only do we have movies coming together as one but we also see a film that uses effects on a huge scale and then also although having to use them a hell of a lot still the movies does not suffer so badly films will never look quite right using effects but the goes a long way in making a movie that is huge on them and yet does not make it look ugly or something to condone as badall in all the film is great and i mean it great fun great acting and just some great thrills to be had marvel do seem to pump out movies everywhere and i am glad that the has not been lost in the massive whirlpool that is marvel movies it stands out because its so big and epic and is definitely a memorable one i would say this is one for the fans but i have no idea in truth although i will say that i dont think many people can find a whole host of problems with this its a film that has been cared for and made in a way that is not just a little escapism and that is it its something you can watch again,fantasy

i did like the idea of a movie that brought a bunch of familiar superheroes together and to be fair they did a pretty good job of thisiron man hawkeye the hulk thor loki captain america and black widow all get their fair share of screen time and theyre all excellent and theres some great moments of interaction the fight between thor and the hulk was my personal favouritebut unfortunately the story was second rate a bad guy brings an army to destroy the earth and the can only stop him if they wait for it work as a teamboringworst of all loki was the bad guy this is the trickster of the norse gods a character who is just perfect for a complex whichsideisheon storyline packed with plot twists and instead they just make him head of an army of demons its a missed opportunity assemble is plenty of fun to watch but its not the great movie it might have been,fantasy
to describe this in one word it would be incredibly difficult but if i had to i would choose superb the acting in this movie is phenomenal the characters are amazing and full of depth and this is absolutely stunning in addition to that the story progression is amazing from seeing all of the heroes in disagreement in the beginning to bringing them all together in an epic conclusion to save the world from loki i just am without words it is everything you could ever want from a super hero movie from the perfect blend of screen time for every character to so many great on liners and humorous moments i left the theater jumping with joy and the puny god moment had everyone in the theaters rolling along with just about every time robert downey jr opened his mouth this is just gold oh and back to the alien fight at the end joss whedons choice of slowly panning around the battlefield showing every single hero fighting through the seemingly unbeatable threat made me feel like i was truly watching a comic book from the interactions to the cgi love i give this a 10 out o 10 there is no throne there is no version of this where you come out on top maybe your army will come maybe its too much for us but its all on you because if we cant protect the earth you can be damn sure well avenge it tony stark,fantasy
in a way it felt like most of marvels superhero films up until 2012 with the exception of iron man were in part a buildup to an eventual film this mainly being down to little details or minor plot points spread throughout the films so with all this buildup a lot was riding on assemble providing what was expected id say that assemble succeeds on star power alone when youve waited for so long to see so many icon heroes all on screen together and when you have such an entertaining cast pulling the strings its hard not to get carried away with enjoyment it certainly has its problems but as far as sheer entertainment is concerned it prospersstory norse god loki returns to earth and steals a tesseract from shield which he plans to use to open a portal and bring an alien army to take over the world head of shield nick fury initiates a plan to form a superhero team made up of those hes previously contacted and they become the only hope in stopping the invasion as far as the plot is concerned it is equally absurd and predictable theres no big twists and a lot of it does stick to some already wellworn clichs with that said it is a blast to see all the heroes together at last there squabbles are frequently very funny and seeing them fighting side by side always is excitingheroes the film manages to balance out all the big personalities rather well yet there are two standouts robert downey jr is once again a magnetic and hilarious screen presence offering many brilliant lines and that well placed sardonic attitude mark ruffalo is simply fantastic as an awkward and edgy bruce banner balancing out all aspects of the character excellently and as the hulk he manages to get some unexpected laughs though both underused chris evans is solid as the stern captain america and chris hemsworth gets enough to do as a slightly more conflicted thorvillains tom hiddleston returns as loki and brings more energy to the role than previously loki certainly seems more weary and ruthless than before which works well in making him seem like a major threat while hiddleston manages to makes the character even more volatile and his delivery makes each line imposingsupport black widow and hawkeye act more as backup to the team with both being decent enough scarlett johansson looks fantastic in the part and convinces as an all action heroine but she struggles with some of the weightier dialogue jeremy renner is simply okay as expert archer hawkeye and he does look the part but he is given little development and comes off as a bit boring samuel l jackson is great as usual with more to do this time around as fury always believable as a commanding presence and giving the dialogue a sparkaction the action sequences are all very entertaining in a larger than life kind of way the physically fight amongst themselves with the fights between the hulk and thor being as well as the hulk and iron man being a lot of fun the large scale fight on the aircraft carrier is exciting as well as varied and its nice to see all the in battle the climax is as extravagant as you would expect with lots of immense action set pieces and it is thrilling to see all the characters work together though it definitely drags on a little too much and at times feels like action overloadmusic alan silvestri provides an effective and suitably upbeat score the main theme itself is simply superb in managing to create a sense of importance and excitement elsewhere silvestri gives the action scenes a pounding backdrop and crafts some good melodiesproduction on a certain level joss whedon does a successful job given the amount of work he had to do fitting in all the characters and making it work he knows how to keep the action gripping and when to simply give the actors some room to breathe while the visuals are injected with enough style and energy to make it work on the other hand i dont think the dialogue is that great unless its downey jr saying it or its used for comedic purposes most of the important lines feel forced simplified or just clichd which is credit to the actors for making it plausible i think that most of the problems lie with the story in that its too straightforward as to whats going to happen and how thing will pan out of course this lets the characters drive the plot a bit more yet many of them just arent given sufficient things to do there is definitely an overreliance on cgi here as well though youd expect that given the massive action scenes and most of it looks good it does take you out of the film and that is very apparent during the climax conclusion on a purely entertainment based scale assemble succeeds thanks to sheer excitement big thrills and funny interactions between our heroes the lighter tone works greatly in the films favour while we also have plenty of cool fight scenes an enjoyable villain and good performances especially those of downey jr and ruffalo however once you start thinking about the plot its the predictability that harms the film and id have enjoyed more risks even if they werent fully realised whilst there is too much action on the whole so at a surface level assemble is easy to enjoy and have fun watching just dont think about it for too long,fantasy
the is an action scifi supernatural movie that mainly about a group of super heroes fight to protect the city it happen when lokithors brother come to planet earth in other to destroy the whole planet but the bunch of heroes have fight against lokis plan and sent loki back to his planet this movie have combine many famous superheroes such as thor iron man hulk captain america and other the character the movie have a good story line and have an awesome action scene the whole story is good from the start to the end the best thing of this movie is the producer make the story based on character from comic book and it is a great success the movie began when the loki come down to earth and thor too have come to earth to chase loki and then thor join the shield the shield have gather the superheroes from all the area and make a force to fight against loki loki have open a portal to allow chautari come to earth but the in the end the have success defeat loki and close the portal back finally thor have sent loki back to his planet the director has make the ending look really cool it make me think that the are really exist and it make me feel satisfy about the movie over all this is a great movie that fill will amazing action and i have to said that this a mustwatch movie,fantasy
i still remember when i used to dream about seeing a group of super heroes teamed up against evil destroying the earth well i guess it didnt take that long to see it realizedthe are here and i must say its a wild ride into the fantastic world maybe the team is not made out of my favorite super heroes but they do just fine supported by amazing special effects that like so many turn the impossible into reality at least on the big screen this movie is a lot of fun especially if you like action its a rollercoaster from beginning till the end and the story is not too shabby either but i do believe tony stark delves more and more into that selfabsorbing personality of his driving me a bit nuts as for the others they care for the action as much and i must admit i did enjoy the journey check it out,fantasy
like a true avenger this movies greatest strength is also its weakness its lighthearted and playful tone makes for some fun moments but they also rob this film of any real depth emotion or suspense while marvel movies are good at being fun to watch with their bright action sequences and lively banter between characters even during what is supposed to be heated battle at a certain point it gets old throughout the film there is no doubt the will defeat ultron so the interest then lies in how they will defeat him and the answer is a disappointing they simply over power him if you enjoy this marvel series where the villains emerge with no real interesting motive and are beaten at the drop of a hat then of course this movie is a must see im just holding out hope that marvel takes more risks in their future films,fantasy
movie review theif youre a fan of epic adventure movies then here your dreams come true the is a movie based on the marvels comic book it is like continuation of marvels previous movies like iron man thor hulk captain america and assembling the different superheroes in one megablockbuster extravaganza the script is well written the characters are fantastic along with their action oneliners and jokes are hilarious action is the best part designed and given by the marvel loki at the end of the thor movie will fall into somewhere and meet one ally promises them for a deal in return for favor of becoming king of asgard shield leader nick fury and the various superheroes included in his initiative fury manages to gather captain america iron man dr bruce banner and super spies black widow and hawkeye and after it they try to save the world togetherthe is one of the best block busters of all time and one of the most fun marvel films,fantasy
hello that review is specially for the people who arent fans of superheroes films im not a superheroes films fan specially on marvel films the best was spiderman i prefer dc comics but in that time i enjoy the film the film was great whit a good history and good special effects too if you want to see a superheroes film but realistic that isnt your film maybe you go to see a dc comics film because marvel had a crazy unrealistic ideas but if you like superpowers and the magician that your film i like specially this film because appears many different heroes whit different powers and different attitude before i saw that film i think that it cant be a good film but now ive a different opinion maybe you when finish the film your opinion change too pd thats my first review and im not from a english country maybe ive grammatical mistakes,fantasy
okay ill break it down into pros and conspros 1 the characters are true to themselves 2 it has an easytofollow plot 3 there are lots of good oneliners 4 theres good chemistry between the heroes 5 the action and special effects are pretty cool 6 it has good pacing the movie continues to build momentum towards a satisfying ending 7 it develops a nice sense of fun and excitementaverage 1 the acting and music were fine but nothing specialcons 1 loki is an underwhelming villain although often amusing 2 the movie starts slow 3 some of the dialogue is pretty hokey especially furys 4 it lacks emotional impact or deeper meaning 5 there are some dodgy plot holes 6 its not very originalsimilarities to transformers 3 speaking of not very original 1 there are giant alien metal monsters smashing through buildings 2 a portal is opened to another world from a tall building 3 an alien army swarms in through this portal 4 the good guys desperately try to close this portal 5 there are evil flying shooting futuristic things 6 a good guy steals one of these evil flying shooting futuristic things and uses it for good 7 we see new york in a mess cars upside down or on fire dust and shrapnel everywhere people screaming and runningin summary the is impressive in the way it manages to hold itself together usually this many characters would be a guarantee of an awful movie but here somehow all the heroes are given their chance to shine and it works pretty well but far out michael bay should probably be filing a lawsuit,fantasy
director fury pulled finally together some heroic egos to face the threat of alien invasion there were a lot of high octane scenes the legendary had to fight themselves before defeating the enemy interavenger fights resolved into mutual respect new york city got destructively made over during the final scene agent romanov and iron man made the most consistent protagonists captain america was torn between taking orders and trusting his thor played along after some physical persuasion from iron man and captain america to deliver asgardian justice against the evil loki tony stark and bruce banner started becoming a good team though thor had to save agent romanov from the hulks confused rage persistence and selflessness finally prevailed over alien corruption and paralytic human fear,fantasy
firstly i have been reading through the reviews and seen a lot of 110we are all allowed our own opinion thats right but seriously attacking those who liked this and in their valid opinion gave it a 1010 makes you look like you are some sort of film god whose opinion is the only that mattersi have given this a 10 because i think it is thats all that matters really if you think its a  fair enough  just dont attack othersso why is it a 10 for me because i have waited for the comic genre to finally be made to the highest level using the technology which allows the universe created on paper to become reality the depth of story or character doesnt matter  its a romp and an adventure and just as my dad enjoyed saturday morning episode cinema because it was escapismso is thisthe 10 comes from the way it makes me feel  like a kid again without the issues that impact life and make you stressed this isnt a comparison with the godfather or shawshank etc its a mark which reflects the personal opinion i have about how impressed i was and how much i enjoyed my 2 12 hours of pure escapism,fantasy
what can be said about the that cant be summed up by the poster in case youve been living in another dimension the past or with the gods you must have noticed that all the most recent marvel films have been running side by side setting the scene from something bigger and this is itthe sees superheroes iron man thor captain america the hulk hawkeye black widow and nick fury come together to fight thors nasty brother  fellow god lokijust check the poster and promotional art out to see whether you think youll like it its big its bold its explosive its special effectsladen and everything youve come to expect from a summer blockbuster apart from the fact that most summer blockbusters are simply special effects and a costly cinema admission the is actually pretty damn goodthe was released in the same years as batman the dark knight rises and many people wondered whether there would be enough room for two such giant superhero movies i would say yes largely down to them being such different types of film the dark knight iswell much darker its not so brash and loud as the perhaps the dark knight is the thinking mans superhero movie either way if you want dark moody and deep christopher nolens batman will probably fit the bill however if you just want some pretty wicked action great setpieces and a bunch of people with superpowers knocking lumps out of each other in silly suits then delivering a witty quip or two then the should keep you entertained for a couple of hourspeople have argued that the superheroes dont receive equal screen time well they nearly do but you have to expect that robert downey jr gets a little more screen time than his counterparts due to him being the biggest star in the film but that should be a minor gripebottom line if you liked any of the previous marvel superhero movies that this film is based on then you will probably like this onebut like i mentioned in the title im guessing it will appeal mainly to young boys or men like me who are still young boys at heart  and it has nothing to do with scarlett johannson in her catsuit honest,fantasy
i enjoyed watching i liked the hulk that came on the 2008 film better than the he looked more real and lean hulk looked more bulking being in the gym as a weightlifter and a runner i know how a runners physique looks like hulk runscrushes jumps and does a lot of running his physical ability to me does not fit with a bulky look i hope your future movies get more thought before putting on film can not wait to see your future films i hope you keep the same actors for these films actor that played in was more appealing to me than the 2008 film i like your films when its 5050 on solving the problem and action,fantasy
this is one of the bleakest films i have seen in a long time all characters are unhappy souls surviving in a grim world unable to improve their lot prone to an almost genetically determined urge to mess things up they have egos and the big guns arent used to working with other people or playing by the rules talking about you thor the cinematography is stark and bare with only the soundtrack adding some effect the acting is very effective its an amazing work and everything i had hoped for from an artistic standpoint there were some plot elements and character developments i didnt think were totally needed they do however drive the story which seemed to be their purpose so i can accept them,fantasy

marvels the broke boxoffice records in the summer of 2012 with the highest grossing opening weekend of all time and the third highest grossing payout in its movietheater career just behind avatar and titanic this major hollywood blockbuster made cinematic history by bringing together the earths mightiest heroes marvel comicbook characters created by stan leestanley martin lieber and finally giving them their bigscreen breakthe great thing about the is that there is no single leading character each of the characters captain america iron man the incredible hulk hawkeye and black widow equally share screen time having already been sufficiently established in their previous standalone filmsthe antagonist in this filmloki is portrayed by actor tom hiddleston loki in the marvel comics is actually the stepbrother of thor one of the primary he uses his cunning sly and deliciouslydevious character to steal the power of the tesseract a cosmic power source and bring a chitauri army of aliens to take control of the earthmarvels the was directed by joss whedon who is currently directing the highly anticipated sequel age of ultron a few of his other works include buffy the vampire slayer cabin in the woods much ado about nothing and toy story all reasonably known projectsalthough i can hardly imagine an audience that would disapprove of this film i must give a warning out to moviegoers who are not keen to specialeffects action sequences and some intense scenes as these are largely found in theas made evident by the tone of my review you can probably tell that i deeply enjoyed this movie i greatly recommend it for all to view as there is something in it for everyone and will be remembered for decades to come,fantasy
marvels the or commonly known as the is an action packed film based on a combination of a series of superhero movies that were all produced by marvels the are an assembly of heroes including ironman played by robert downey jr thor played by chris hemsworth the incredible hulk played by mark ruffalo and captain america played by chris evans after an unexpected enemy begins to threaten the security of the world nick fury played by samuel l jackson and his partner played by scarlett johansson gathers these heroes in order to try to provide peace from the enemy and save the world from crumbling though this movie was slow to develop and seemed to drag on at parts through the introduction the action picks up as the movie proceeds with a welldeveloped cohesion of parts by the conclusion of the filmthe introduction to this movie developed at a seemingly never ending pace i did not agree with how it seemed to drag out but i sympathize with the director this had to be done though in order to portray the plot of uniting these heroes and showing the initial skirmishes of the heroes as they met each other as the heroes began to get along and unite as a team the development of the film began to become more tightly knit the characters grew together starting as people who barely knew each other to fighting side by side against their enemy with the combination of all the wellknown actors in this movie no one seemed to steal the show or become power hungry for the leading role in the movie as the film developed all of the actors sunk into their roles and adapted to their part and the other parts around them gracefully the cohesion of the film was as welldeveloped and original as it could be the ironman series captain america hulk and thor have already been produced as films by marvel and in comic books in previous years this led to a unique and different production by taking all those different films and seamlessly integrated them into one piece this made for an action based film with the right amount of humor to make it amusing and appealing to the audiencethe cinematography and the setting in the film also added to the cohesion of the piece as a whole the setting was based out of cleveland but was made to represent new york with starks tower set up to be in the center of the new york city skyline the real credit should be given to the cinematography of the film which made the film come alive we as the audience feel like we are right there fighting side by side with the heroes helping to take down the enemy at hand in its entirety this piece really captured my attention and left me waiting for more after every scene although this film seemed to drag on at the beginning it ended up being well developed and action packed which kept me wanting more along with the cohesion of this piece came a quite original development as the director meshed the different parts and characters together this allowed them to fight alongside each other to try to save the world from destruction you will have to watch to find out what happens as the fate of the world is left up to the new team of,fantasy
i had a friend describe this movie to me like that before i saw it and i have to agree this is rdjs show and its not surprising given his exceptional charisma and fan base this also explains why hes easily the highest paid in this moviestill the rest of the supporting actors are pretty good the story is good as well and thank goodness theres some awesome loki business going onits entertaining the production value is high and its just a good action flick it doesnt fall victim mostly to a lot of stereotypical stuff that can make an otherwise good action movie fall flatoverall recommend it,fantasy
its rare that a movie is able to not only live up to its hype but actually exceed it matches the hype surrounded by it and then blows it away this huge scale superhero movie set the bar astronomically high for all other action movies none of which have come close to attaining that height sincethe pulled together arguably the greatest cast ever to share the screen not only was this an incredible feat based on the actors and actresses but the characters themselves many worried how the movie would stay balanced and give each character their dues but director joss whedon proved it was possiblei wont get into the plot much as its been explained numerous times and honestly you should watch regardless of what the plot is but with that said the movie centers around a group of superheros brought together to stop an evil force loki and his evil plans the movie explores the dynamics of all the characters working as a team and how they pull together to extinguish lokis catastrophic planthe most intriguing part of the movie aside from the fight scenes are the character dynamics joss whedon does such a good job making the banter and interactions between these superheros feel real the snide remarks and off comments felt genuine complement to all the actors involved who took this dialog and delivered the movie is endlessly quotable and everyone will find a character than can truly enjoyspeaking of the fight scenes they were absolutely fantastic the battles were large scale fought between numerous superheros and armys of bad guys there was carnage throughout and it was a sight to behold there are even times when there is a little in fighting amongst the and its quite a treatthe was a case of every single person doing their job and doing it at the highest standard whedon with his direction downey jr with his cocky demeanor and hemmsworth with his goldiness even mark ruffalo stepped in a filled in the hulks shoes nicely i could go on and on about each actors brilliance but just trust me when i say everyone was excellentif you havent seen the avenegers what are you waiting for,fantasy
the 3d effects in the movie were second to none but the story consisted of mainly just conflict after conflict there was nothing truly intelligent about the plot or any of the twists it is worth watching to see the effects especially iron man flying around they did a great job of making you feel like you were in the actionim disappointed with the imdb rating and feel that the studios are now finding ways to game the ratings system by adding a bunch of paid propaganda imdb used to be my go to site but with how high this movie is rated i feel i need to find another site that is more accurate imdb used to be spot on but obviously they are selling out for ad revenue,fantasy
now the problem with a film such as the aka assemble aka marvels spectacular spectacle is that it can only be compared to its predecessors and can not be a pure fresh story it does indeed have cracks in its foundations with the decent iron man and captain america and mediocre iron man 2 and thor but the is as great as it could be the main factors that makes it stand above those rushed charmless creations is its genuine heart pumped in by joss whedonit has a genuine tension something that was dramatically lacking in the other films based on the mere concept that they were setup films for this blockbuster therefore the protagonists nor throwaway side characters simply could not be in any meaningful peril despite that being what the action films were about in the the characters or egos can barely stand to be in the same room with each other for too long without the chemistry exploding as it has multi protagonist stories it opens the opportunity for there to be a real chance of one of the characters being in mortal danger without being contrived and that is pretty much expected from whedons trademarksthe heart of the film lies mostly in tony stark and bruce banner as it develops stark as a human being in very brief sequences though of course his classic punchlines are a particular highlight but the paints the hulk as the secret ultimate weapon which is a difficult task as the terrible hulk 2003 and equally awful the incredible hulk 2008 struggled to portray the scale of his power he certainly steals the scenes that stark doesnt i saw in in 3d so it was a particularly intimate experience  there are some amazing goosebump worthy shots of the superheroes all together  but it made it sometimes confusing as the effect doesnt work well with closeups of action especially as it distracted from the science jargon thrown around by stark and banner rendering some of the scenes hard to follow but it didnt matter in the endits still astounding in how whedon crammed everything in despite the 142 minute running time of which it had a comparable pace to the dark knight in the scale of the sequences it was incredibly satisfying and creative by the end however the series may struggle as they dont have the benefit of having equally famous villains as batman and spiderman have i dont think i have the patience to watch the sequels to the rest of the avenger films just to keep up with the characters but it really does depend on the writer and director as i didnt like thor and loki in their own films but enjoyed their relationship here nevertheless the is the perfect summer blockbuster intelligent witty and actionpacked and i wanna see it again alreadyupdate i did and it lost most of the shine that charmed me still entertaining but just not the same710,fantasy
i expected the worst for this movie i really didi expected just a bunch of special effects and no storyi was pleasantly surprised that this movie is actually very very good and yes i was right about the special effects but this movie does have a heart and a story i liked the way they brought all of the characters together i even liked the soundtracki highly recommend this movie i think it ranks as perhaps the best comic book superhero movie ever made and ive seen them all i used to think that the 1978 supermanthe movie and 1981 superman ii couldnt be surpassed in 2002 the first spiderman movie came close to being as good as the first two superman movies but i still believed the superman movies still tops until this movie this is the comic book movie that finally dethroned the first two superman movies in my humble opinion yes i think it is that good,fantasy
im a long time marvel comic reader and know the superheroes in the quite extensively hulk being my number one read and the in my top 10 this movie was well made with loads of entertainment possibly to capture all audience members who have very little to no knowledge of marvel comics if i was to walk into this movie without knowing anything about marvel comics i would have been thoroughly entertained the computer generation was fantastic visual effects were stunning weve come along way since superman with christopher reeve the actors skills were superb especially robert downey jr i loved all the humour chucked in these light moments were well placed at the proper scenes that being said to add just a couple complaints as a die hard marvel fan here is how marvel could have made this a better movie and future movies 1 loki there could have been a more original villain regurgitating an old foe from the thor film was lame there is so many choices that could have been used 2 thus speaking of thor this is not the real thor i didnt like the thor film and i certainly would not give it the votes i give the thor in the comic book was much bigger and possessed more power and abilities i think marvel should have used cgi technologywith thors character instead of using a real life actor they did a great job with hulk so why not make thor with a awesome physique and structure another little thing to notice actually my wife did is scarlett johansson the scenes where she is running is hilarious i think she should have practised those scenes better because she looks like she just discovered her legs and their movement other than that it was an excellent movie since i am a huge hulk fan im glad they gave the spotlight to him with a multitude of scenes,fantasy
this film was expected since 2008 with the movie hulk movie more or less since marvel has promised the film the the famous group of super heroes basically the justice league marvel then came the movies iron man 2008great iron man 2 2009good thor 2010good captain america 2011very good and finally in 2012 came the expected and exceeded all expectationsa film that brought together four powerful super heroes and 2 that appeared in the movie iron man 2 and thor with all the elements of a superhero film and who directs it all joss weedon nerddirector best direction for a superhero film there its not except for nolan the dark knight he took the heroes and their bds took manhattan the stage of all superhero movies and with a little touch of realism and pum  the bornmanaged to put together a fantastic action die laughing humor and even a bit of emotion and the most impressive are the heroes all were perfect in their roles and each had their moment in the film it didnt had a main character all leading heroes in the film are for example when iron man appears it is all about him when hulk appears everything it is about him and thats with all the characters but to understand the story better its kind of mandatory watch the other films that i mentioned earlier but you can see the same movie and love it completelyafter the dark knight trilogy the is the best superhero film ever made,fantasy
there is plenty of action to be seen when you watch the after watching all the stories of how the other comic book heroes became who they are it is unbelievable to see that they all came together to become a team even though they did not agree with each other at first it is like a dream come true to all those people that had high hopes of all the characters combining their powers to stop one great yet evil mind loki the tall thin and brunette tom hiddleston also brother of thor the brute blonde played by chris hemsworth joss whedon did a great job directing the movie and even though i did not read the comics the storyline was spot on showing that there is no i in team orit was pretty interesting watching all the heroes clash before they became a team because it reminded me of a fighting game where you pick your fighters and choose the map they battle on while time was wasting they finally became a team tony stark or ironman played by none other than robert downey jr and doctor bruce banner or incredible hulk played by mark ruffalo which could have been played better by the original edward norton or lou ferrigno have to locate the tesseract the crystal loki needed to get revenge on thor by letting the chitauri distract the so he could take over asgard i thought it was interesting how they used the different characters to acquire different information i believe this was showing that even though you have your differences there are other things out there to worry about than seeing who is betterjoss whedon gave all the characters a specific role in the movie which was good because nobody was really left out of course ironman thought he was better than everyone else and believed that everything revolved around his smarts and his work he smartly remarked to captain america in the previews that even without the suit he was a billionaire philanthropist and that chris evans was just an old experiment that was frozen for 70 years black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to me were like spies in the movie even though hawkeye was possessed half the film the roles played out great and the movie had its dramatic momentsi was hoping that this movie was going to better than what i was imagining which it was i figured maybe it was going to be cheesy even though the previews had me chuckling but at the same time i was left with suspense i really hate when they leave hints throughout the movie as to what to look forward to in the sequels but that is how media makes their money the was a great movie,fantasy
team of a lifetime the is not just a film it is a well thought out story however the background of thor captain america and iron man 2 are almost mandatory prior to watching or the will make no sense and possibly bore you to death the combination of five different films introducing us to different characters and stories turns this movie into reality throughout the different marvel films there was question to whether the writerdirector joss whedon was going to follow through with his previous productions and deliver a film that lives up to the fans expectationsthe is without a doubt classified as a science fiction movie filled with countless amounts of action and comic book references the is made up of an assortment of intense music ambitious characters fastpaced plotting special effects rivalry between the hero and villain and suspense according to marvel fans this movie by far sky rockets their expectationsthe complex movie begins with iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow all teaming up and creating the super hero team of a lifetime when an unexpected enemy emerges and threatens global safety and security nick fury the director of the peacekeeping organization shield finds himself in need of a phenomenal team to save the world from disaster therefore a daring span of recruitment begins however once brought together the struggle to trust each other and work as a team meanwhile in previous movies the super heroes were forced to work individually therefore the films theme arises when the outsiders start to realize that by using their outstanding super powers and working as a team they are capable of becoming something great and in this case capable of saving the world from thors adopted brother loki loki has characterizes of each superhero he is facing therefore it takes the teamwork of each superhero to defeat the lokiit would be unfair to focus solely on the positives when negatives do exist in the it seems as though joss whedon focused more on the battles and special effects in the movie then on the actual background and explanation of defining the characters without the additional background of the prior films the seems to be confusing the two and a half hour movie almost needed to be stretched out to a three hour movie in order to include all of the important background information to get the movie off to a better start and to make more sense to viewers who have not seen the background films besides with the lack of character explanation the film has a rushed feeling and can become rather confusing,fantasy
getting to know themarvels brings together many big names in the comic book world six gifted protagonists  iron man robert downey jr dr bruce banner aka hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson set out to battle one sole antagonist loki tom hiddleston and his alien army the movie gives each character their shining moments keeping it from focusing solely on a certain character it is your typical action packed family movie that everyone can enjoyfor someone who hasnt seen every marvel movie that has come out in the last couple years the movie makes it a little difficult to recognize all of the characters like black widow and hawkeye however without knowing all of the characters the plot remains easy to follow loki is the villain and sheild isnt going down without a fight sheild is briefly mentioned in some of the previous movies and is usually denied by the heroes each of heroes has to fight internal battles they each have to get over working alone and try to work together its a very typical of the characters to not get along at first and then come together as a great teamfor almost the whole movie the heroes keep you laughing like a typical family movie keeping the humor even in some of the more action packed parts of the movie can keep many of the noncomic fans interested in the movie however one huge weakness that the movie had was the comment that thor made about loki being adopted it sets a negative light on adopted children labeling him a tyrant because of it another weakness i felt the movie has is that the were so easily manipulated by loki in their team they have two of the greatest minds of their generation working together and they still didnt get that loki was using them for his personal gain how does one villain manage to overtake six highly talented and well trained super heroesi hadnt seen thor or the hulk when i first watched the i had no clue what i was really going to be stepping into when i purchased my movie ticket i was worried i wouldnt know half the heroes and i definitely didnt know the villain thankfully the plot was easy to follow and light was shined enough on each of the characters to give me at least a light grasp on who the heroes werethis movie was really fun to watch for the first time it was a little long but it kept my attention throughout the whole film i feel like more of the heroes personalities could have been shown more but in that case the movie would have been too long iron mans witty banter was hilarious as always as well as lokis the is a film worth watching at least once as long as you have seen the other marvel movies,fantasy
i do not follow the marvel comic empires characters all that much but i really enjoyed this movie it seemed a little over the top until i remembered it is all nothing but movie make believe the stealth cloaked vtol air ship was kind of cool and the special effects were what can i say special i was a little put off with the samuel jackson portrayal of nick fury his character was cold standoffish and a using manipulative boss the manipulation he used to bring the together with the death of the nerd was necessary but theatrical of course it would work because it was in the script  the over all acting was very good if basic i tend to think we see a large part of the real robert downey jr in his role of ironman while he is a gifted actor when he tries i do think he is a bit of an egomaniac and the stark character fits him well,fantasy

i know that the one billion dollar and a half income causes dizziness even for me  but who said that the highestgrossing movies of all times should be the best movies ever made  no doubt that marvel studios has done it with the right ambition order and budget in 5 years plan the release of 5 movies the incredible hulk 2008 iron man 2008 iron man 2 2010 thor 2011 captain america the first avenger 2011 and a calculated connection between all of them they made a good foreword for this dramatic climax which turned into a financial climax for marvel itself their plan and the superhero movie in general but was it that good its good as a huge scifi action joss whedons love for the marvel world did marvel as a scriptwriter  director he interweaved the heroes story lines well filled the movie with the ultimate action he could get and made fair time on screen actually the movie is made of fun robert downey jr as iron man stole the show not merely because his power as an actor but originally because his starpower which guaranteed him the bigger role the best oneliners and the heroic situation at the climax captain america was the weakest in powers amongst the rest but that was compensated finely by making him the planner wise brain of the bunchi loved the formula of hot action always followed by funny oneliner what i loved more was writing a motive for the movies evil guy lokis speech about wanting desperately to be a king did satisfy something i used since my childhood to not see it satisfied in 99 999  of the american action movies  the visual  sonic extravaganza was wellmade all the explosions sound effects etc dazzled perfectly and kudos to the editors of this movie they managed brilliantly to cut the material reasonably and enjoyably the movie didnt turn into crazy hurlyburly at any time thats a big victory to be proud of putting in mind the majority of the action flicks we get from hollywood latelyand the cameo of stan lee is welcomed as ever for one reason hes funny and ironically used and for another its loyal and honorary to have him around age lengthened with the 90 year old marvel comics writer to witness his creation as movies and yet be part of it too but on the other hand certain characters werent up to the rest and yes i mean scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff and jeremy renner as clint barton  hawkeye they could have been fit for another movie instead a regular spy movie for the first still the shot in which the camera rolls around all the while the ends fight makes me laugh especially when i see natasha holding her little gun as if a peer to the superpowers and super dangers around her the plot permits some bugging questions to be asked for instance what was lokis plan while being on shields flying aircraft carrier he didnt use the hulks anger as he intended to do  the problem of the hulk wasnt clearly explored i couldnt understand what was the matter of the point is im always angry  and why he got blindly furious on the carrier then hello hes fighting for the good side at the end  lokis army wasnt that threatening only some bizarre looking goons to be killed with no particularity the way dr erik selvig and hawkeye awake of lokis charm is truly laughable just a good hit on the head  pacewise i thought that between the end of the second act lokis escape from shield and the start of the third act lokis attack on new york city there was something missing like some events were rushed yet the main shortcoming has to be the matter of lacking the inner motives i know that earth is at risk and agent phil coulson is killed but the lead characters didnt have personal issues to overstep which didnt add any dramatic deepness to the mixthis is marvells promised ritzy festival and it works gathering all the audiences of the previous 5 movies and the readers of the original comics behind them i love it as fun summer blockbuster with no thoughts allowed i even long for part 2 and 3 but to tell you the truth while movies like avatar titanic the harry potter and the deathly hallows  part 2 and transformers dark of the moon are on the top of the highestgrossing movies of all time right now i long to the day where not a summer blockbuster will join the list and  why not  be its number 1 i believe that someday the people will get enough of the summer blockbusters and go on a pilgrimage to something else something more serious and less flawed something that talks to the mind and the heart more than the ear and the eye ahh when will the ordinary people become better than the superheroes ,fantasy
josh whedons the is by far the best super hero movie ever two and a half hours of this action packed thriller will leave you wanting even more the heros need no build up they have all been introduced in the previous marvel films and we are able to jump right into the main story personally the part that makes this film the best of its genre is that unlike all the movies that came before it takes place during the day in bright and vibrant locations the cgi does an amazing job and we are no longer stuck in night time brawlswe are thrust right into the action with thors brother loki in a strange realm hosted by the dark leader of the chitauri who promises him the aid of an alien army in exchange for securing the tesseract armed with a new weapon that can fire energy and take over your mind loki heads to earth with earth helpless the must be formed a team of super heros ready to save the day its great that all the heroes have been introduced and we are left wondering how all these huge personalities will mesh together weve gotten to know tony stark the outdated captain america mighty thor provoking black widow the perfectionist hawk eye and the whole monstrosity that is the hulk does a great job in showing how all these heroes befriend one another because of their interactions but before earths new team of heroes can find their balance loki is in their heads causing anger and conflictsfor all of the crazy battles and action the best moments are the slower scenes that develop the characters bonds from the hulk giving a pat on the back of thor or tony stark and dr banner talking in scientific terms that nobody else understands it gives this sense that the interactions are true and lets us relate to them even if or not a fan of the series not to mention the unexpected humor in the best of times giving us as viewers a kind of relief from the nonstop actionnow for the downsides though only few the story is very predictable in terms of its plot and youre really never left wondering whats next but just whens the next explosion also the film seems like more of a tv show then a movie but overall this movie is the best of the best when it comes to super hero movies,fantasy
now im no expert on criticizing the film industry but if i do say so myself the was an excellent movie i have not been one known to read comic books so i have no experience to judge whether the film stays true to the graphic novels there are many factors that i consider when reviewing a movie i look at the acting quality how it compares to similar movies in the same genre the plot line and also the special effects quality in my opinion the acting quality was superb each character had their own unique qualities about them and i believe that the actors portrayed those characteristics to the best of their abilities robert downy jr played tony starkiron man and his character was very intelligent but also very conceited and egotistical robert downy jr gave his character a sense of humor which kept our hearts at ease at the most dramatic moments i believe mr stark was the comic relief in this movie and kept the movie alive with comedy chris evans plays steve rogerscaptain america who is a man from a different era his confusion but loyalty to america reminds us of the patriotism we should feel as americans although his confusion is a fault for himself it always is another comic relief for the audience mark ruffalo plays bruce bannerthe hulk his ability to stay calm and relaxed is inspiring to the viewers but when he loses the ability it creates an intense moment that keeps the audience members on the edge of their seats there are many other characters in the movie but that was just to name a few next i would like to take a look at how this film compares to the other films in this genre in comparison to the other marvel movies i do believe this was the best not only was it jampacked with action and thrills but it also included many other the other marvel characters i like how this movie intertwined the characters from the different movies and formed them into one the way the director joss whedon explained how important teamwork is and how its valued is inspiring to people of all ages also in comparison to other movies outside of the marvel company star trek might have some competition when it comes to the although the two films have similar qualities i feel that the takes the cake on this one in favor of star trek the film had a romance aspect that is more appealing to the female population and the avenger did not entirely portray a love plot line in the film i was very impressed with the special effects quality of the the way they presented the superpowers of each hero was unbelievable also the fight scene towards the end of the movie and how the aliens were entering the portal through the sky was astonishing the special effects in this film looked and felt so real to the audience which makes this film more enjoyable because it showed something that we could imagine being real all in all this film had excellent qualities that defined is as a must see i am anxiously and impatiently waiting for the sequel,fantasy
since iron man and the postcredits scene of the incredible hulk we were infatuated with the idea of earths mightiest heros assembling onto the big screen as more marvel movies featuring the members of the as main characters in their own selftitled movies were released more hints towards an movie came out foreshadowing events such as agent phil coulsen talking to pepper potts about shield or captain america being found in the ice after the events of captain america the first avenger such hints kept people in suspense until it was finally announced that there would be a marvels the moviethe choice of joss whedon as director could not have been a better fit half of this movie is centered on the character interaction and anybody who has followed shows such as firefly or buffy the vampire slayer knows that whedon can exploit the dynamics of a team as well as the volatile components that come with putting a group of people together with different attitudes and viewpoints scenes such as the arguments that members of the get into aboard the shield helicarrier are just as entertaining as when they are on the streets of new york fighting loki and the chitauripart of the reason i feel that this movie was so successful is that joss whedon did not try and tie a stupid love story into it other than the established relationship between black widow and hawkeye there is no mushy love dynamic to the plot this helps give more screentime for things such as intercolleague fighting like that of thor vs the hulk the only flaws with this movie is the inevitable under use of a character in this case it is hawkeye with a film like this the only way to keep it from being four hours long is to cut out some scenes with some characters looks like jeremy renner drew the short straw on this one after only making a cameo appearance in thor also the plot of the movie is pretty cutanddry loki wants to take over earth and the must stop him there isnt really much else to ithowever i find that the amount of awesomeness packed into the battle scenes of this movie more than make up for this from the two on one fight of captain america and iron man vs thor which levels part of a forest to the hulk thrashing loki around the room the action in this movie keeps a grin on your face whedon knew which fights could be epic and he made them epic he also demonstrates some of the more subtle abilities of the such as hulk catching the pilot trying to bail out of his jet a nod to the hulks super reflexes or captain america using his gymnastic skills to move across the damaged helicarrierjoss whedon has set the standard for the following marvel movies and the sequel hinted to at postcredits with thanos and his evil grin the bar is set high and with movies such as antman and captain america 2 coming out it will be interesting to see where they take each members stories and set them up for the following movie,fantasy
joss whedons marvels the is a wonderfully crafted and delightfully surprising detour from the prevalent super hero blockbuster film formula there has been constant chatter about an film for years among super hero fans even long before the film was announced ever since spiderman opened the door for film adaptations of the sizeable marvel super hero roster if the marvel universe was going to be put to the screen an film was an obvious choice for a finale of sorts there will almost certainly be sequels to the film buffs and comic book gurus alike expressed growing uncertainty at the prospect somewhere around the time of the disappointing spiderman 3 and thor films though captain america and the iron man movies were almost unanimously well received the hesitation was mostly due to the way recent super hero movies have been produced too often we were forced to acknowledge awkward pacing convoluted and ineffective plot lines excessive reliance on special effects flat dialogue and questionable camera work to name a few complaints from a very long list when it was announced that whedon would be at the helm many were reassured and anticipation grewit would seem whedon was the perfect choice for this film its easy to see how poorly it could have been executed by a more pedestrian writer and director the film plays to expectations and winks to fandom without being exhausting or pandering while avoiding the clichs that drain the energy from other marvel film outings whedon expertly avoids the grim trend yet does not venture into camp or goofiness his tightrope act between genres and conventions is equally impressive as it is beneficial to the film in a vague way he seems to capture the spirit of the comic book story arcs themselves this is certainly not super heroes shoehorned into an action flickthe large cast of characters is executed about as perfectly as possible there is a fantastic on screen chemistry particularly throughout the childish feuds between iron man captain america and thor the sharp contrasts in their personal beliefs about their powers and society are highlighted and displayed in a thoughtprovoking manner whedons experience is evident with the plot driving the characters rather than a mechanical rationing of camera time between each hero a great example of this is how he utilizes the incredible hulk a character that has been the bane of more than one director knowing we havent seen the hulk in action in a few years and that we would be eager to see how he is managed in this new and more mature setting whedon doesnt reveal bruces maniacal alterego until roughly twothirds into the film and when he does the pay off makes the buildup strategy a clearly superior choice the villainous loki is a fine nemesis in concept and is rendered successfully as dastardly and detestable whedon opted for a more light hearted and entertaining overall feel with none of the heavy handed forced philosophy though there is a wellplayed theme of the need for cooperation the theme carries over well and does justice to the concept of the americas greatest minds and forces with vastly different abilities and personalities setting aside their differences and squabbles to save the world,fantasy
marvel has taken over the movie industry with their movies the hulk iron man 1 and 2 captain america thor and its most recent and greatest film the despite the being one of the greatest films i have ever seen it fails to establish a sense of character development on the other hand the has the greatest special effects of the century and does a great job of capturing a comic book feel while implementing real world issuesif you havent seen the prior marvel movies you are a bit behind in the joss whedon expects you to know who the characters are its as if he expected comic book junkies to be the only ones watching this movie granted the is a sequel to the prior movies but that is no excuse for having certain characters appear in prior marvel movies and this one and not telling us anything about them if you havent seen the prior movies you would know more about the disappearance of natalie holloway then you would the characters in this movie i have seen the prior movies and i would have just as good a chance at passing a foreign language exam as i would at telling you three or more facts about the black widow and hawkeye if you do know the characters or you can get over not knowing them the is a very good movie the special effects in the are the best of the century director joss whedon took all of the available technology and used it to his advantage all of the effects are completely believable which is tough to do considering they had to be able to do special effects for multiple characters a prime example of special effects is the hulk and his ability to smash things and kill people if you have seen the prior hulk movies you realize that they found the special effects to be very difficult in the prior movie made in the early 2000s the special effects look as if they were from the early 90s the special effects werent the only way that the managed to recreate the comic book feel most of the dialog and actions of the characters were very comic book like by this i mean short and straight to the point this is good for the movie because it brings it back to its original roots the comic book and if youre not a comic book fan the is full of real world issues that provide a sense of connectivity to the people who arent avid comic book fans first we see the issue of the military constantly trying to upgrade their weapons system the american military thought the tesseract could help them upgrade their systems which is why they had it in the first place second the battle a foreign war takes place in new york this seems to be a common battleground in movies and in real life in the movie they are not fighting iraq or korea they are fighting foreign creatures from another realm despite them not fighting another country the idea of foreign war is still there to build on this we see the destruction of new york which also happens to be the last city destroyed in real life last but not least is the idea of superheroes winning a war in the movie and every other superhero movie for that matter we see the superheroes solve the minor problems such as war we never see superheroes solve the big picture problems such as world hunger overall the is a must see try to get past the poor character development and see that the special effects are amazing and that the movie although not directly relates to real world issues if you do this you will be thoroughly impressed with whedons work,fantasy
the is an action packed film that was well made and has wonderful graphics and special effects the plot was easy to follow and the story was not too complex it was a very easy movie to relax and watch along with all the action in this film there was also a sense of humor in the way of the interactions between characters however i was not personally a fan of this film in order to understand the characters and relations among characters the viewer has to have background knowledge of superheroes and past superhero films i have never seen any sort of superhero movie before so watching this film was not an enjoyable experience while i enjoyed the graphics and action in this movie it was very hard to follow and understandthe main goal in this film was to protect and keep the tesseract a main source of power safe near the beginning of the film the tessearct was taken by a villain named loki and his army throughout the film the team of superheroes comprised of iron man captain america thor hulk hawkeye and black widow work together to get the tesseract back in their hands to prevent a disaster if the tesseract fell into the wrong hands it could cause great damage because of the amount of power it holds involving global security the main plot of the story revolves around the superheroes working to get the tesseract back from loki loki and his army came from a different world in order to retrieve the tesseract from the the knew how important it was to keep the tesseract in this world because of its immense power various conflicts occur throughout the film between the and loki and his army as the story comes to an end there is a very large battle between lokis army and the at the end of the film one of the sides ends up defeating the other and earns the tesseract it was very hard to understand the relations among these characters and how they worked together based on their past because of the lack of character development without knowledge of these superheroes and their relationships it was near to impossible to understand how they interacted with each other i was very confused during one of the conflicts because thor and the hulk began to fight each other i did not know that these two superheroes do not get along so i was very confused as to why they were fighting each other instead of trying to win the tesseract back if the characters were more developed and explained in the rising action of the movie i believe i would have enjoyed it much more this movie is a wonderful choice for a viewer that is keen on their knowledge of different superheroes but if the viewer does not know much about superheroes i would not recommend this movie,fantasy
the was a highly anticipated film something as epic as an allstar team of superheroes would be nothing less many including myself were doubtful that it could ever meet the high expectations still millions of people perched in front of the big screen to watch it for the first time and to many viewers surprise it surpassed expectationsthe is a glance in the bright direction that marvel is walking this film strings captain america thor the incredible hulk and iron man together along with several sequels a fresh breathe from generic remakes and love stories this film includes several witty remarks by selfacclaimed genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark and the occasional physical humor that so many films attempt to do but the blows out of the watermarvels wide array of characters makes it hard not to relate to one they range from the egotistical genius and the modest genius with a serious anger issue to the oldfashioned war hero and godalien although the last one may not quite fall into the category relatable it displays the creativity and thought put into these charactersthe casting in this movie simply couldnt have been done better one may think that robert downey jr was made to play iron man but many will say iron man was made to play robert downey jr if that doesnt say enough itself the hard headed nick fury is played by the always brilliant samuel l jackson chris evans may make you believe he is actually a wwii veteran mark ruffalo plays a mean hulk even in comparison to edward norton and thats only three the list certainly goes onthe storyline is hard to complain about a battle between some of our favorite superheroes and an army of aliens is pretty exciting to say the least selfish intentions and lack of teamwork override the team until they are provided motivation through a though loss and they rally together the seemingly perfect squad reveals its insecurities throughout the film making them all the more relatable to the audience the ending battle is incredible first time watchers are probably going to be wideeyed for the entire scene a heated battle with flickers of comedy and adrenaline pumping fight scenes could not have been made any more awesomeif i had to make one complaint of this film i would have to say the lines from the films are hits and misses meaning sometimes they can be quite cheesy it is a superhero movie and that may be expected but we need a plan of attack i have a plan attack made me chuckle and not necessarily in a good way another example resides in the same scene where captain america says theres only one god maam and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that an additional complaint that can be made is the astonishing way that the black widow who has no super powers can jump off a spacecraft flying at high speeds and land safely while stopping in a space of maybe 5 feet but i suppose realism is not really the most desirable factor in a movie regarding a superheroalien battle with gods and a flying aircraft carrierthe is a classic film i would never think the dark knight would have a film of its genre even come close for quite some time for some this film may surpass it the promises to keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline and laughter flowing through your body,fantasy
 marvel at its bestthe movie that came out this past summer was one of the best movies that has come out in the past few years it was the much awaited superhero movie that would combine the movies of iron man hulk captain american and thor although the was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time it was not perfect the problem with most if not all superhero movies is that there are so many different stories or universes it is hard to pick which one to make the movie about the movie proves this point by having different characters other than the ones that were in the original comic which this movie is suppose to be about the first team members of the consisted of the hulk iron man thor and one that was not in the movie ant man the first comic was issued on september 10 1963 captain america does not even join the until the comic 4 issued in march of 1964 the plot of the movie was great it does a good job of blending the new age of comics with the old the movie kept the same plot as the first comic book with loki being the main villain the one difference is the time period of which the battle takes place in the comic it takes place in the 1960s which makes sense since that was the time period it was written in while the movie took place in modern time joss whedon did a great job in converting the old out dated form of the into the new time period he did this by adding modern military weapons like the f35 as well as adapting the whole story to modern times by adding in space travel gps and better computers just to name a few the actors that played in the movie by joss whedon each played their character very well the one actor that really played his part well was robert downey jr he played the part of tony stark extremely well his character is self centered has an extremely large ego and to top it off he looks almost exactly like the comic book character another character that i thought did great job in this movie was mark ruffalo who played the hulk as well as bruce banner the hulk has been in two other movies other than the and both movies have had different actors portray the hulk and bruce banner the one in the was by far the best one they have had the way ruffalo played banner was extremely close to way he is portrayed in the comic books banner is a confident scientist who is not only looking for a cure but is also using his knowledge to help society unlike the other movies that portrayed banner as being a scared and work obsessed scientist who is only focused on curing himself in conclusion the movie was an amazing culmination of all of the marvel movies they have made up to this point the way the director interlocked the stories and different movies gave everyone who watched them background information on the various heroes as well as the villains although the time period that the movie took place was different than the comics the director did a great job in carrying over the key aspects of the comic i would by far recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies superheroes movies as well as comics,fantasy
joss wheldons the is a fusion of recent marvel movies like iron man thor the hulk and captain america whether or not you have seen the movies parts wont make sense unless youre a marvel fanatic its an action comedy scifi movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat but laughing at the same time if youre anything like me the movie will irritate you throughout knowing that its a bunch of movies mixed in i began to question myself if some characters i didnt recognize are in other movies like the black guy with the eye patch or the girl spy that seemed a little to porn star and her partner if you were comic book reader you would know they were black widow hawkeye and nick fury loki is thors adopted brother who tries to take over the world and become the leader i feel like lokis thought that we have to much freedom is inaccurate in america we are lucky but a lot of the world isnt as fortunate lokis idea to rule the world because of this is not thought through the are sent out to stop him and his invading army the production quality was successful after watching the movie i was curious as to what was actually real in the movie and what was special affects the distinction was seamless unlike the production of alien which is what these aliens remind me of i would recommend watching it at night because it is so dark at times its almost impossible to see on the other hand the acting in this movie was outstanding when it comes to the plot the creativity was good the characters have the same personality as in their own movies but are mixed in with jointly in such a way that the characters play off each other it involves examples of real life human emotions rationality and faults but is done in a premature way i feel like the conflicts between the team are silly and felt unreal this movie has many clichs in it for example why does the epidemic always seem to happen in nyc why do our leaders feel the need to bomb every place that they cant deal with why do the characters always have to argue and then make up at the end why does the hulk never talk until the end in conclusion the movie was an overall success the production quality was amazing along with the acting the movie was very entertaining and well done along with almost every movie there is something that everyone doesnt like,fantasy
third highest grossing movie of alltime is none other than the now the is the ultimate popcorn get all your buddies friday night kind of movie each character had a distinctive personality and i liked seeing them clash with one another youre not going to see this as oh im captain america oh im the incredible hulk im thor hey we just met each other lets go fight evil together no their personalities clash and you really see the characters building relations arguing and overall interactions amongst each otherthe is a great adaption of marvels famous comic books starring robert downey jr as tony starkiron man chris evans as steve rodgerscaptain america mark garofolo as bruce bannerthe hulk chris hemsworth as thor scarlet johansson as natasha romanovblack widow jeremy renner as agent clint bartonhawkeye samuel l jackson as nick fury tom hiddleston as loki clark gregg as agent phil colston stellan skarsgard as dr erick selvic and i think ive hit all of the high notes those are the most important people in the movie at any rate robert downey jr iron man you knew exactly what to expect from him and his character due to his starring roles in the two previous iron man movies he still delivers captain americatony starkchris evans again you can kind of know what to expect from his previous film but there are some changes to his character because he is now a man 70 years out of his time this dude is suffering from the worst case of culture shock ever and he manages to get that across i was actually fairly impressed with that he is moodier than he was from the first captain america movie which is to be expected because everything he knows is just gone chris hemsworth as thor again you kind of know what to expect as there has been a thor movie he did manage to portray the changes in thors character because honestly this guy has suffered some pretty hard blows in the last couple years and hes more thoughtful more introspective not nearly as arrogant just as reckless still just goes charging in with the hammer with that said they didnt do a complete rewrite of thor which is good all in all he did a good job as expected which is great its what you want anyways same goes to say for all the other characters they deliveri actually didnt care for the opening sequence too much loki showing up and having the scene devolve to a car chase felt odd to me throughout the film everyone is a smart ass at the expense of genuine dialogue its funny the first couple of times but really grates on repeat viewings another thing is if you havent sat down and watched the previous marvel movies such as iron man incredible hulk thor and captain america you will not enjoy the movie anywhere near as much as the contrary that is not to the detriment of the though really its what allows the to be as good as it is as it can get right into the action all of the character development the other stuff that has taken place origin stories explanations of characters whos doing what to whom back story and all of that stuff has already been taken of prior to the so you can come into this as a viewer and see these heroes doing what they do best frequently throughout the duration of the filmgreat actor portrayals and staying true to the franchise is what makes this film such a hit the is that kind of big hollywood blockbuster that you dont get to often the gets a high score in my book and it is probably one of the best movies marvel has ever made,fantasy

the story goes that back in 1961 martin goodman the owner of a struggling comic book company played a round of golf with one of the owners of dc comics the man was doing a bit of boasting of their recent success with their justice league comic a revival of the allstar team concept of the justice society of the 40s goodman went back to his editor and asked for something like it that editor stan leeput his head together with the companys best artist jack kirby and they conceived the fantastic four the stakes were high as the company was close to going under it paid off and the marvel age of comics as lee liked to call it had arrived this hit would spawn more eventually leading to a true rival for the concept of the justice league a team of marvel allstars and the were born throughout the years the would be a book of visual flair action and epic tales in various hands the book would feature not just a group of stars but a real teamnow almost 50 years later marvel studios has done the same frustrated with the lack of control over their cinematic adaptations even when things worked out well marvel formed their own production company they did not have an easy job as their biggest name characters had long ago been sewn up by fox and sony they would have to start with characters who werent as well known outside of the comic world they began with iron man the film proved a hit both with the casual audience and the fans who followed the comic over the years it was well written well cast well acted and well executed marvel didnt rest and progressed with their plan to introduce a new movie in close succession to the previous one much like the comics paths crossed and old heroes welcomed new one by one the members of the came forward it all came to a head with the moviethe film is first rate with a great cast and excellent visuals the previous films established the characters so time didnt need to be wasted reintroducing the characters much like james bond we start with action and stop only to plan for the next event the scope is epic enough to warrant a team of people rather than an episode any single member could handle a common fault in many justice league stories where superman dominated all joss whedon a fan with strong credentials in the comic world hits the notes right he introduces the threat then begins assembling the team however teams in the marvel world rarely work harmoniously at the beginning they test each other argue trade barbs but when it counts they get down to business this truly felt like the comic brought to life much as richard donners superman had before and christopher nolans batman had more recentlyits not a perfect film though there are a few to many convenient moments like the scientist unconsciously building a failsafe into the dimensional gateway hawkeye and black widow are still underdeveloped as they had little more than cameos in the previous films dialogue suggests a history but they are still mostly cyphers to nonfans many character moments ended up on the cutting room floor due to time constraints so we dont really get to experience captain america struggling with an unfamiliar world in a related note cap never really sounds like someone from the 40s hopefully sequels will be able to explore these things more and the film series can mature beyond just an action spectacle as the comics did whedon and the cast  crew certainly gave a foundation on which to buildthere are many moments to enjoy from whedons trademark wisecracking dialogue to tom hiddlestons layered villain to the revelation of shield as more than just a glorified marvel fbi there are some excellent quiet moments in all of the thunder and we see the human costs of the battle which is too often missing from these things in the end the film earns its success heres hoping that marvel wont rest on that success and try to venture into some of their other books especially those that dont revolve around superheroes the company produced some fine western and scifi characters not to mention someone needs to do a howard the duck film that is as good as the comic was,fantasy

personally i prefer superhero soloists to superhero teams perhaps because it is easier to delve into and devote more time to a single superheros characteristics psychological motivations and objectives also i think by their very nature superheroes tend to be defiant isolated loners  they are different from and surpass the abilities of common people therefore i was particularly pleased by director joss whedons triple accomplishment in the he faced the challenge of plausibly uniting and coalescing several different actors with different acting qualities  especially when only one of them robert downey jr as iron man has any national recognizability no knock against the rest of the ensemble group of course whedon faced the challenge of combining and meshing several wildly disparate superheroes resolutely used to being lone wolves and functioning solo finally whedon faced the challenge of giving each hero equal substantial time to strut their stuff in the spotlight even the deceptively ordinary nonsuperpowered black widow scarlet johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner i think whedon admirably succeeds on all three countsi also admire whedons deliberate deft restraint in plotting the much as it might chafe adrenaline addicts impatiently waiting for the cataclysmic new york smackdown the movie takes its time to establish the god of mischief and evil lokis tom hiddleston nefarious partnership with the predatorlike aliens the chitari and their unholy contract chitauri in exchange for the tesseracts or cosmic cubes improbably infinite power send an endless horde of warriors through a space portal to help loki conquer earth theres a lot of necessary exposition in this first half of the movie the not only has to gradually reveal lokis ultimate motives and introduce and reintroduce each superheros personality and conflicts the movie must also surmount various obstacles including slambang infighting and shields latent exploitation of the tesseract to develop extraterrestrial preemptive strike weaponry to the becoming a cohesive fighting unit with the commanding nononsense guidance of unflappable shield commander nick fury samuel jackson the grudgingly but steadily get their act together they realize that saving the earth takes priority over petty squabbles disagreements and even betrayals including the one black widow uses to bring and unleash dr bruce bannerhulk mark ruffalo into the fold yes thats a lot of exposition to keep straight but whedon handles this mammoth task welleventually we get to the global battle and what a colossal battle royale it is again whedon displays his juggling skills as all the make their unique contributions towards fighting the chitauri threat the director modulates the rousing fight scenes well enough so you dont eventually feel overwhelmed and worn out the only three critical observations i have about the conflict are these 1 the chitauri gliding in on their aerial cycles seemed to serve the same purpose as the battle droids in the star wars prequels gun fodder in other words they seemed to go down much too easily their only advantage was sheer weight of numbers 2 its a major miracle no citizens get killed and 3 whos going to pay for the cleanup afterwards wait there may be a fourth shouldnt it occurred to the earlier that closing the portal was the solution ahh whatever its a stupendous spectacle besides the spectacle theres much to savor in the whedon especially through the smartaleck banter of the selfabsorbed iron mantony stark provides several hilarious oneliners and dialogue that keep this enterprise from sinking into ponderous selfimportance however ironically the wrathful hulk provides the movies three funniest scenes especially when he confronts the vainglorious loki at starks phallic tower and dismisses him as a puny god downey and ruffalo engage in inspired technospeak when attempting to locate the tesseract even the nonsuperheroes especially furys selfsacrificing man friday phil coulson demonstrate their heroism of course the cgi special effects including the way the hulk resembles a pumpedup mark ruffalo and the undulating chitauri spaceships resembling ancient whale skeletons are mindboggling but convincingi could ramble on and not begin to cover all the facets of this successful production if you like marvel the balanced ensemble work andor fullthroated action thrillers i think youll love this movie if you prefer cerebral contemplative movies i think you may find something to like about the the dark knight and any future adaptation of the justice league of america should tremble at the high standard they have to reach so be it ps if you have the patience to wade through the end credits you will see a postscene midway which sets up the sequel where the will encounter the embodiment of death itself at the very end you will see our beloved superheroes enjoying shawarma in a deli i looked up shawarma on wikipedia  think shiskebob or gyro,fantasy
i give it 810 it is very good and i really enjoyed it but im not a big fan of action but upon hearing about this film i know i had to go and see it i love superhero movies and this is no exceptionthe acting is very good from all involved the directing was also very good and there was a few laughs in it overall no masterpiece but defiantly a good time due to its action and jokesit does what needs to be done in terms of action its not over the top and there isnt too little of it it finds the right balance i would recommend this film to any action superhero or any movie lover who just wants to have fun for 2 hours 20 minutes,fantasy
it almost seems superfluous to add more to the mountain of reviews for this movie but that never stopped me beforewhen i was a boy i used to go to market stalls and buy marvel comics if only id kept them i could retire a rich man so far so normal but this was in the uk where comics meant the beano and dandy you couldnt rely on collecting a whole series of a particular title in the 1960s  it was just a matter of luck what had been imported and was up for sale it was pretty much a minority interest in the uk i say this much just to make the point that i have been a fan of marvel characters for more years then i would like to admit to and so i fit that dreadful fan boy demographic from an earlier generation i feel i know the characters and i know how they should be treated assemble as it is known in the uk to distinguish it from a beloved tv series of a different nature is a film that i was able to enjoy as a fan the characters were well developed and the interaction between them was particularly well handled and affectionate the action scenes were well handled though i have some reservations about the notalways impressive cgi that slipped through in places i thought it would be too long at 143 minutes but i was never aware of the passing of time whilst watching it and it did not feel like the marathon that some 90 minute movies can sometimes besome people have criticised it on the grounds that the plot is too simple and obvious or that the dialogue is too jokey but it fits the requirements for this type of film based on this type of material and what a joy it is to have whedons turn of phrase and playfulness if you want to look at the underlying machinery then it follows the heros journey template like many most other successful movies except it has to fit all the characters into the journeyits not the worlds greatest movie and its not art house but then it was never intended to be its good fun and delivers as much as a fan could want mark ruffalos hulk was a stand out for me the two previous hulk outings have been pretty awful in my estimation but this was pitch perfect and the hulk delivered the best laughs in the moviei dont really know how you compare an arthouse movie with a blockbuster fun movie it probably cant be done this was great entertainment and id sooner have that any day than worthy but dull,fantasy
this movie was amazing you should only see it if you saw iron man 2 thor captain america and hulk i would recommend this movie to everyone any age if you are considering watching it just go watch it right now you will be amazed i even happened to find a better trailer for the on httpqgs1816460marvel also this website will help you find cheap tickets at your local movie theater this movie will not let you leave the movie theater feeling unsatisfied or bored it will let you leave feeling happy and thrilled to have seen the movie this is a great action packed movie for you and your movie have fun watching the,fantasy
a wellwritten script there were a few moments that were almost oscarworthy but i think they lowered the bar for stuntsweve seen better stunts in x2 the scene where nightcrawler attacked the president and even in the incredible hulk blonsky in the incredible hulk the super solder had a great stunt scene when he fought the hulkbut did we see that in no we didnt even see it in the last captain america movie how much better could this movie have been with great stunts one hundred percent better this movie has lowered the bar for stunts,fantasy
its big loud and delivers just what you expect from a summer blockbuster a fun cast drops jokes like it is open mike night at the comedy clubthe action gets redundant and the movie is a tad long if you are looking for a relaxing time at the movies this isnt it it is an assault on the senses the 3d that was an addon didnt seem worth the upchargethe after credits scene is good for a laugh but not worth sitting through the credits to get thereit seemed like ironman was the only character with any sort of a life it was nice to see a few moments of pepper potts always barefoot as not to be too tall for tony starkgreat start for summer box office everyone will see this movie once there is no need to see it twice,fantasy
this is one of the best action films i have ever seen but its not the best superhero or comic book movie ever bests are tdk sin city and history of violence to me anyways im being very nitpicky here so when i say some things im not saying its a bad movie i loved it its just that it could have been better and speaking being better the film could have done more on thor and lokis relationship thor is very underplayed here as a character he is wiser and cooler than the last film but he has no character or chemistry between others sure there are some scenes where loki and thor are doing shakespeare in the park but it could have gotten a lot somberer or emotional to us plus loki was very one dimensional here his goal is very stupid and i am actually glad that whedon took note of that but he could have at least try to make loki interesting he is cool and all but his objectives are so pointless hes basically a joke in this film whedon could have made him a lot more terrifying and less cheesy although whedons goal probably was cheesy for this film the scene where black widow is interrogating loki is awesome he should have been more like that hes really threatening but hes also an indirect comic relief another problem i had with this film was the dialog there were a lot of funny lines but whedon could have done sooo much better the dialog for cabin in the woods was just fantastic it couldve been like that here but it just became corny all the serious lines are sooo corny and sometimes unbearable and although there are some negatives whedon does do a great job at sometimes making some corny scenes pretty funnyand those are my negatives about this movie im not going to write a lot about the awesome things about this movie because ill be repeating what everyone has said yes this film is beautiful yes it is action packed fun yes it is funny but if i had to add anything else whedon did terrifically by making this film feel right its a movie for everyone i definitely recommend everyone to see it its a wonderful film it doesnt have an amazing story to tell and in fact the story is very commonplace its like indiana jones  seven samurais everyone will enjoy this film 8510,fantasy
the is the long awaited superhero blockbuster that has become a living wet dream for all the marvel fanboys and fangirls now basically hollywood made this movie for two reasons which goes as follows 1 to have a mesmerizing and memorable set piece at the end capitalizing on the latest special effects and bring all the comic book characters to life and 2to make a godly amount of money and theyve succeeded on both levels breaking box office records and creating a finale so engrossing and entertaining it was nothing short of awesome to see iron man fighting alongside captain america while the camera pans to the hulk raising hell i could feel the hair on my arms raising on this level the film worked really well but the first halfehhfelt a little shaky now i should note that i have not ready any of the comics nor do i know much about the marvel universe so ill try my best to not seem completely ignorant the first half was decent enough but it definitely could have been improved or made more exciting all the stuff about getting the team together maybe dragged on a bit too much and the movie didnt explain itself very well from the get go now maybe thats because i havent read any of the comics but i really think that they should have explained things a little more clearer but this is a superhero movie so it honestly doesnt really matter in fact i predicted how this movie would end before i sat down in the theater but that doesnt matter either the only thing that does matter is that it has the comic book characters that everyone has grown to know and possibly love and that it has a lot of incredibly cool action scenes but more on that later the film was really good on an acting level some of my favorite scenes in the movie were just the characters interacting with one another robert downey jr played robert downey jr and plays it perfectly chris evans did well as the patriotic out of time captain america mark ruffalo was particularly good as bruce bannerhulk although he didnt get nearly as much screen time as i would have liked samuel l jackson played rick fury and he definitely wasnt as samuel l jackson as he should have been with the exception being his line well its a stupid ass decision jeremy renner played hawkeye and im pretty sure that the screenwriters forgot about this character completely and wrote him in at the last minute because hawkeye really doesnt do anything i like jeremey renner but i feel like his was awfully miscasted in this movie scarlett johansson was there to look super sexy in that black leather but im still wondering why a vulnerable attractive russian spy is doing in a superhero team when she doesnt have superpowers but once again what do i know tom hiddleston plays the main villain loki and is without a doubt the standout role with an amazing performance and a memorable character design hes an actor that im looking forward to see in the future and then theres thor chris hemsworth now i dont like this actor i dont like thors character i have no interest to see his movie and i have so many questions that i wont even bother starting so on to the next topic which would be the script its a fine script joss whedon is a fine screenwriter but if there was one thing that i had to and will comment on it would be that there were far too many corny one liners some of them were funny most of them were stupid the end result is that i cant even bring up any examples of the good jokes because they were buried under all the bad ones the only person who needs to be making snappy one liners is tony stark because hes an arrogant smart ass but thats just my opinion the script did make me laugh more times that i would have thought and then theres the music it wasmusic nothing standout here i guess the other thing that id have to mention is the way that its shot and edited sometimes it was a little jarring it felt like they took and mashed techniques from iron man and thor and captain america and it just ends up looking a little wonky it never took me out of my movie experience but every now and then the camera would tilt or reverse or the dreaded shaky cam techniques would be used and i feel much like the story that it could have been a little cleaner and fluid and now im done complaining none of these things matter like i said the only thing that matters is the action and the action looks great and its a lot of fun to watch i barely felt its two and a half hour running time it was enjoyable and entertaining and even made me laugh a few times the reveal shot of loki in the beginning was particularly funny although i seemed to be the only person in the theater who laughed it even has stan lee in a little guest appearance towards the end so the movie wasnt perfect but nowadays what is if you expect it to live up to the hype then youre going to be disappointed but if youre looking to watch some good special effects good fighting evil snappy one liners and something to just turn your brain off to and shovel popcorn into your face then this is the perfect movie i really enjoyed it and would recommend it highly,fantasy
last night i watched the most anticipated movie themovie is about group of superheroes fighting war raged by loki and his alien army movie is entertaining which will keep you to the seat to last minute director joss whedon has done awesome jobcgi effects are better than transformers selection of superheroes is almost perfect although there is a little problem they should have selected peter parker  spiderman instead of natasha romanoff  black widowblack widow looks out of space through out the movie and also iam very disappointed by captain america costume it looks very cheap and old fashionednot to mention clint barton  hawkeye his acting is good but where he gets unlimited arrows from credit goes to making this movie a success and entertaining to mark ruffalo as drbruce banner  hulktom hiddleston as lokitony stark  iron manfinal words any fantasyaction movie lover should not miss this flick,fantasy
after setting it up with multiple films about how the individual characters gained their super powers the finally brings together all of the heroes in one story to either work together as team to defend earth or fight amongst each other aided by their massive egos and verbal bravado perhaps never before in cinema history have there been so many movies released as prequels to set up the eventual crown jewel batman and superman only met in the comics not on the big screen the appears to be sort of a test case to see if so many leading superheroes can all share the same screenwhile all six characters each receive a certain amount of on screen time and side story some are pushed more into the foreground than others as iron man robert downey jr is a fan favorite and is always handy with a funny quip he is front and center along with captain america chris evans who even though does not have much of a super power places himself in a sort of leadership role within the group thor chris hemsworth the hulk mark ruffalo and the two characters that did not get their own films black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner all fight for the leftover screen time in the background the puppet master is nick fury samuel l jackson who spends most of his effort in sheep dog mode herding these guys from their billion dollar towers or their selfimposed exileso what possible threat is great enough to require the efforts of six superheroes eh its just loki tom hiddleston thors adopted brother who has a chip on his shoulder he zooms down to earth with greasy hair a ridiculous hat and the backing of a large and formidable alien army known as the chitauri countering loki would seem like a job for just thor or just iron man not the catalyst for the to finally come together as a team ah but here is where the film really takes off most of these super beings are not team players iron mans ego is way too big to share space with somebody else the hulk does not trust himself to walk down the street and captain america cant believe these prima donnas represent the future america which remains quite strange to him entrusted with helming this new and starstudded film is joss whedon the brains behind firefly buffy the vampire slayer and angel he has only directed one movie before this the wonderful serenity i would have guessed the studio would go with a more experienced director however whedon has proved before he is more than capable with this type of material im not talking about action movies but the verbal sparring witty conversational scenes and complicated story which must make a lot of room for almost too many characters whedon brings his trademark strengths with him including humor when you think of the hulk the words humor and ironic laughter do not pop up in the first 20 adjectives to describe him but in the the hulk becomes the most amusing character to watch which is all due to whedons skill there are a few details which do not work as well as others which hurt the films appeal a little bit to bring the together and mold them as a team requires a tremendous villain however loki is not that guy he is more of a villains sidekick or henchman rather than the main baddie then there is nick furys helicarrier which can also cloak itself and appears to be an upgrade but direct ripoff of sky captain and the world of tomorrow oh and cobie smulders as agent maria hill was the absolute wrong casting choice for her role an unknown actress is always better for a supporting role because every time she was on screen all i could see was robin from how i met your mother those are just details though whedon shows he was able to weave together a complex sextet of superheroes and take them through the difficult process of becoming a team for simplicitys sake some heroes are featured much more than others but any other script and director would have made the same choices the is very good during its climactic fight scene where all of the plot threads come together but loki as the villain is just not up to the challenge hopefully whatever sequels come down the line are able to up the ante a little bit,fantasy
this is a review is in 3 parts the movie the message the futurefirst the movie is the sum of its parts they are done well which seems undisputed from movie making acting special effectsetcpov however it isnt more than the sum of its parts which we consider the classics to be its like addition but no multiplication it is so segmented and connected by convenient superficial ways as far as box office records it should make this much money given the awareness of this movie since iron man 6 individual movies and the increase in ticket prices if it didnt then it would be an unmitigated disastersecondly the message it is a war mongering movie it declares that we have to fight whoever to the death and we will be victorious contrast that with the message of the dark knight which tries to say we can overcome this violence some other way and sometimes to do that there is no clear victory or nor should there be that ultimately too much war or too much peace is too imbalanced to survive or thrive so you see the different styles serve their messages where tries to not go too deep and not show much of the ugliness while dark knight shows it allfinally the future there is tug of war between people who think we are doomed to fight it out or we can find another way the end days vs the beginning of new era what we believe is what will happen because actions will be driven by them if the approaches the dark knight or surpasses it then we are doomed  to show we arent doomed go see it once but no more to show you are open we need a landmark movie to bridge these two sides i just hope its not too late,fantasy
this is a very good movie but 88 stars good not even close and the main reason is the story which isnt that compelling rather its pretty standard superhero has to save the world from an evil force the storyline has few surprises and is predictablewhat brings this movie up to 7 stars on my meter is the execution of it the dialogs the acting the jokes and particularly the special effects its just outstandingwhat is not so outstanding is that scarlett johansen and other nonsuper heroes are hiding behind yellow cabs with tiny guns their enemy monstrous godzillalike flying snake creatures that can knock over the empire state building in a matter of seconds and which throws cars 100s of feet in the air and which couldnt care less about bullets these nonsuper heroes magically survive and even contribute significantly to beat the monsters from outer space without any injury whatsoeverits kind of disappointing that so many reviewers so far are so emotional about this movie it kind of reminds me about dark knight another very good but way overrated moviewho can honestly say that this movie is even in the same category as shawshank godfather and goodfellas and such the story simply isnt there theres nothing memorable about this movie or dark knight for that matter i wouldnt see it again,fantasy

so every few years we get an obligatory hollywood presentation of a comic book story these films can be either really really good films like the dark knight iron man or really really bad films like last years captain america personally im a fan of movies in general im no comic book freak and before seeing this film i really couldnt tell you the first thing about the but i was told this was gonna be the one the superhero movie that i would love more than any of them this was hyped up to be the best yet it has all our favorite heroes plenty of crazy action and breathtaking special effects and a star studded cast so i had high hopes and was excited to see this movie which is rare for me when a new superhero movie comes outfrom beginning to end there is no denying that this is the years first blockbuster im not going to waste time describing the movie though as honestly we have seen it all before basic save the world plot but with a medley of all the most famous and powerful superheros what this movie does do is take special effects to new heights this is by no means a thinking mans film but it is not supposed to be this ones about getting the bad guy and causing a whole lot of explosions and plenty of adrenalinepumping battles robert downey jr shines as usual as tony stark and his performance is the showstopper and shining moment of this movie all in all there is something for every kind of movie fan here it does what a blockbuster should do entertain us and captivate us for a few hours with its bigbudget effects and simple story line this is nothing we havent seen before though and while it is worth a second viewing especially for the diehards it is nothing that i will spend my time raving on and on aboutoverall 710,fantasy
i have watched several films that span across many different categories and timeframes everything from the absolute greatest to the alltime worst rated films in my honest opinion i believe that the movie is far from perfection but definitely in the 9 rangea superhero film like this calls for tons of action and excitement and this movie delivers on every level and then some a wonderful cast made it seem believably true  a rockhard culmination of protagonists and antagonists in cooperation to fight the good fight against an unruly evil even if you were attending just to see one superhero you would still get a kick from the others in the bunch they were all at the top of their game in this film and there was not a single head in the audience that was not sitting at the edge of their seat in amazementexcellent cast great dialogue wonderful camera shots for the action scenes and trust me there were plenty of action scenes to go around several fights going on at the same time so if you were disappointed with one fight you can eagerly await as the camera approached another fight scene and it was constant battle to the very end if there is one superhero film you should watch its this one  and if you dont feel like watching it in the theatres now at least be openminded to pick a copy up when it releases on bluray  dvd,fantasy
marvels the is the eagerly awaited convergence of the marvel studios superhero films starting in 2008 with iron man and ending last summer with captain america the first avenger while it may not be appreciated or understood by those who have not seen the earlier films and although it relies more on spectacle and less on plot its nevertheless a fun and exciting action extravaganza  a comic book film in every sense having recently cowritten and produced the highly overrated horror spoof the cabin in the woods writerdirector joss whedon delivers an entertaining escapist fantasy thats just as funny as it is pulsepounding he also gives us plenty of eye candy only some of which is enhanced by the films presentation in postconversion 3di have no baggage attached to the various characters or the comic books from which they came so any potential observations or complaints that this movie is not faithful to its source material will fall on deaf ears all i can respond to are the stories as they appeared on the big screen despite various writers directors and stylistic approaches ive been pleased with the results even thor generally the least liked of the intertwined series had just enough to earn my seal of approval the standard was set with iron man which remains the best of the marvel series and still ranks as one of the greatest superhero films ever made i think i was right in not expecting the to top it it allowed me to enjoy the film for what it is and not for what it should bethe plot revolves around the teaming of tony starkiron man robert downey jr a recently unfrozen steve rogerscaptain america chris evans dr bruce bannerthe incredible hulk mark ruffalo the third actor to assume the role in the last ten years the thunder god thor chris hemsworth natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson and the skilled archer clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner under the supervision of nick fury samuel l jackson the director of a covert government organization known as shield essentially the must save the world from thors evil adoptive brother loki tom hiddleston who plots to subjugate humanity by opening a wormhole and unleashing ruthless alien warriors to achieve this goal he must recapture a glowing blue cube known as the tesseract a powerful but potentially deadly energy sourcethe rest is pretty much just window dressing we have plenty comic book peril and violence theres handtohand combat and laser blasts exploding air freighters and smashing hulks hammering thors and the devastation of manhattan which is essentially the goto city for glorious destruction we have floating monstrosities that look like giant eels clad in armor we have numerous references to the previous marvel films including appearances by gwyneth paltrow clark gregg and stellan skarsgrd alas natalie portman makes it in only as a portrait on a computer screen we have mutual distrust amongst the and furys hidden agenda we have loki acting like an arrogant dictator forcing a large crowd of people to kneel before him and yes we even have a cameo appearance by stan leewhedon has never been a master of dialogue although his flippant style is perfectly suited for the tony stark character who has always possessed a biting wit and a natural superiority complex the rest of the characters sound a bit goofy although i guess that was the intention consider greggs character agent phil coulson when he finally meets steve rogers in person he drops his aloof mystique and becomes an excited fanboy eager to have his collection of captain america trading cards autographed this movie proves that visuals have always been whedons strong suit in the case of the he uses them to evoke not only excitement but also a sense of humor some of the funniest sight gags are reserved for the incredible hulk who truly is only good for smashing thingsmovies like marvels the are a unique marketing opportunity  a franchise assembled from other franchises that will itself inevitably spawn a new franchise this is not a criticism merely an observation as long as im being entertained it doesnt matter to me how much a product is packaged even if it comes within an inch of its life i was very much entertained having said that i cant help but wonder how much mileage this series has left can five separate films and one convergence adequately serve as the basis for an sequel will the original five inspire any sequels of their own story wise i find myself growing wary the last thing i want is for all the fun to stop one of the quickest ways to make that happen is to allow franchises to overstay their welcome chris pandolfi wwwatatheaternearyounet,fantasy

after some right duds in the comic franchises lately  eg the latest dark duff knight rubbish and iron man2 it is refreshing to see an adventure that keeps you entertained almost throughout the film revolves around the character loki partnering some vicious aliens to take over earth  cue get a group of superheroes together who have starred in their own films to row and fall out but finally come together to take on the enemy the action moves along at a pace the script has some witty moments the best being the screen operator who turns on his space invaders while the earth is under attack ms paltrow provides some fleeting eye candy the cgi is well handled and not too overbearing and the acting appropriate eg samuel l jackson and scarlett johannson one note actors provide the well tuned one note performances required of them and the hulk comes out well after two appalling films not having seen captain america and thor the socalled tessaract did not mean a lot more than the wonder cube does in any other film eg transformers the fifth dimension that dreadful camp bruce willis scifi movie but it provides continuity for teen boys who swallow up every blockbusting comicbased film that comes out and the movie dashes along to its inevitable conclusion  a huge fight in the middle of new york as the aliens pour out of a black hole ok but lets not get carried away as if citizen kane is about to get a reboot with cgi,fantasy
i have been very excited for this movie to come out being pleased with the other marvel movies such as iron man thor etc i couldnt help but get excited for this one as well by the time the last credit rolled i left feeling only half satisfied on the good side of the movie amazing cgi it really was all brought together well creating exciting action sequences the acting was pretty good also it was the same old characters we learned to love and adore but the thing that stuck out the most to me was mark ruffalos hulk he brought the character to life and to be quite honest i didnt really care much for the hulk until this movienow on the other hand there was a down side to this movie the movie just seemed to drag on almost as if they were building up the characters all over again but they already had their own movie so why also and i know i wasnt the only one on this but the whole story line was to clich bottom line it was a really good movie top ten no top 50 yes although i left the theater feeling half satisfied it brought back the excitement of the movies and its a very exciting adventure definitely a must see 810,fantasy
all hail the new king im not saying this to anger the nolan nation or egg on the distinguished competition but id have to rate marvels a true 1010 masterpiece and the best comic book movie ever made it is as close to a perfect movie as you can get regardless of the genre ive noted before that superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy flaws spiderman has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character tdk has generally held the title as most technically sound and highly rated superhero movie iron man has generally held the title as best allaround superhero film thor and captain america jumped in last year and added their own unique flavor but i can honestly say that tops them all in every single category it is imo shear perfection on every level its smart intense well acted thrilling fun and superbly donemarvels been on a roll since the record breaking success of iron man and heres where it all pays off and man does it ever has my vote for film of the year because it lives up to all the hype and all the hope this movie was excellent and entertaining and deserves all the praise it has gotten,fantasy
finally caught the my thoughts overall a good movie whedon made good use of every character even the minor ones no one cares about black widow nick fury hawkeye action scenes were topnotch especially those that involved hulk amazingly prior to this whedon had not directed any blockbusters to speak of yet they chose him to handle a film of this magnitude and fortunately the producers confidence in him paid off because this movie was a home run my only complaint was capt america and how useless he seemed being overshadowed by the others just give black widow the shield otherwise having both on the same team was redundant anyway i dont know who wouldnt be entertained by this film movies like this are the reason why we go to the cinema so we have something to talk about afterward,fantasy
id give it an 85 perhaps because all the hype is really difficult to live up to except for one scene everyone but me seems to enjoy the humor i disliked the iron man movies for the same reason and would prefer a more serious tone the choice was however financially smart contrary to popular opinion i also prefer the old nick fury from the original marvel continuity the action becomes a little repetitive towards the end since suspending disbelief that any of the heroes could ever seriously get hurt or die is impossible yes all the characters are given time to shine and ive always trusted the directors name he takes pains to explain everything including why most of the heroes who are supposed to be masked are out strutting their actors faces around the whole movie which they wouldnt do in the comics in spite of watching this expensive spectacle on 2d i was surprised to notice a few background scenes that looked fake i hope they make jla darker but given the success template of the and the greater prevalence of humor in jla comics that would be unlikely i bet dc is crying over spilled milk for not letting josh whedon do the wonder woman he wanted,fantasy
in one of the most highlyanticipated action films or movies of any genre to be honest in years marvel sudios in conjunction with paramount pictures has produced another super hero winner making the total worth more than the sum of its partssimply put the a justice league knockoff that first appeared in comic books in 1963 is actually better than most of the films which featured the members of the team iron man thor the incredible hulk black widow captain america and hawkeye  with the possible exception of the first iron man the eric bana version of the hulk flopped in 2003 but was revived somewhat with edward norton in the role in 2008 thor released last year was a decent picture but captain america faltered because of a weak second half and the fact he needed so much assistance to battle red skulloriginal graphic novel characters wasp and antman were omitted in this scene versionhere as recruited by nick fury samuel l jackson a member of shield the strategic hazard intervention espionage logistics directorate a global peacekeeping organization the group is brought together after thors brother loki tom hiddleston escapes from asgard and is bent on ruling the earthhe arrives via the tesseract a small cube capable of either providing all the energy the planet will ever need or destroying life as we know it armed with his spear which can literally change mens hearts he captures shield agent clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner the hurt locker the town and dr erik selvig stellan skarsgard thor and forces them to set up the energy sourcethis will supposedly open the portal between worlds and allow an army of destructive alien allies to support his world conquest dreams hold on though while certainly powerful and godlike loki has incurred not only the wrath of his adopted brother chris hemsworth cabin in the woods but the smarmy tony starkiron man robert downey jr sherlock holmes as wellsteve rogerscaptain america chris evans captain america and dr bruce bannerhulk mark ruffalo academy award nominated for the kids are all right soon join the fight all of these characters have some kind of machinebased godly or geneticallymutated super power hawkeye and natasha romanoffthe black widow scarlett johansson we bought a zoo are just athleticallygifted spiesassassinsand while loki is captured and imprisoned in a huge floating aircraft carrier his plan to divide and conquer begins to take effect as each member of the squad not only has a super power but a super ego to boot interteam conflicts break out all over as captain american battles iron man who battles thor who battles the hulk who battles black widow who battles hawkeye etc etc etchere the movie takes a bit of a pause for exposition but thankfully it got over itself and gets down to the concluding conflict featuring scaly lizard aliens and large snakelike robots which wreak havoc and destruction upon new york city just think of what the deceptacons did to chicago in the last edition of transformersin fact these scenes seem to point out in no uncertain terms that his henchmen are actually much more frightening and threatening than loki himself there is even a most hilarious sequence when he shouts arrogantly at the hulk i am a god you will have to see for yourself what happens after thatfinally putting their differences aside the realize they have to work together or earth will indeed fall under the reign of a madman or worse the cgi and other special effects in these scenes and throughout most of the film are seamless and close to amazingin his directorial debut joss whedon who wrote cabin in the woods uses a deft hand and just the right touch in combining fastpaced spirited action with the sharp oneliners and snappy rejoinders weve come to expect from movies like this the best lines are naturally gotten off by stark but banner and even his alter ego fire off a few great shots as well this of course is in no small thanks to writers wheldon and zak penn the incredible hulk the grandits loud funny thrilling and leaves no doubt as to the inclusion of a part two look for a nice little surprise midway through the credits also as usual creator stan lee makes another hitchcocklike appearance which hardcore and casual fans alike will appreciateand while the movie is shot in 3d it is not really necessary considering there are only a few scenes late in the film which actually accentuates the technology and some patrons may not want to pay the extra fee for itso as summer blockbuster pictures move further away from the actual season the is nevertheless a great way to kick off the advent of what hollywood hopes and prays no doubt will be a recordsetting four months at the box office,fantasy
i was thinking all the way as to why this movie was named and not iron man 3 it was iron man all the way the main hero others were simply there guess to be there i would have surely mistaken this for iron man 3 if i had seen trailer without any mention of the namethat said it was indeed fun to watch i liked it better than other such movies like transformers referring to alien invasion and action sequenceshaving said that i loved the movie no doubt fantastic entertainment go ahead especially you like iron man you will not regret itthumbs up,fantasy
ok i rushed into the afternoon show with my brother at the cinema i didnt expect much because i thought to many cooks may spoil the broth but as the movie began awesome superb action last one hour was terrific hulk rocked in the movie all were great the best cgi i have ever seen i recommend its a must watch i have seen it 3 times in theaters the story lacks something but everything is covered up by the humor action and lots and lots of cgi graphics the movie rocks waiting for 2 and as per 3d i recommend u wont miss anything much in 2dthe best scene in the movie was when bruce banner turns into hulk and punches into the alien,fantasy
when 2012428 2000where dream mall kaohsiung taiwanhow driving to theaterwhy my cellphone company taiwan mobile invite me a member of vip with two free tickets to see this moviewhom went with my friend pingzong originally im not that kind of big fan for the comic books and want to yield to another friend however hes busy that day so i just went with the other onewhat despite of some irrationality of the movie what it inspires me is the idea of making an elaborate story with diversely substories and some hints in them and converge later into a cohesive one the idea should be huge with key features across the substories so that a major one can subsequently consolidate them some idea of scene doesnt fall into the traditional and surprise and impress you thenconclusion a good one for recreation,fantasy
i am a huge fan of superhero movies so i had to see this one in the cinema i had my doubts about this one though a group of individual superheroes who dont know how to work together and have to work together as a team and yes it was just this way how the movie started the first half was boring i dont like jeremy renner as an actor and this movie didnt change that feeling for a bit i just dont like hawkeyethe hulk and of course mark ruffalo was just incredible yes he is the best hulk ever but to be honest it is bill bixby who has put banner on the screen in the first place we are now in 2012 and now mark is the bruce who will be the next bruce banner the hulk was funny surprisingly good entertainingthat the movie was about thor and his half brother was disappointing i thought we had that fight one year agonow there is one thing that is bugging me this year is all about competition between the and the dark knight rising i dont think the new spiderman will be in the same race but i like to be surprised after seen this movie i hope i will be satisfied in july with the dark knight rising the just didnt entertain me the whole time some parts it was just boringthe movie had action a lot of jokes the second half was great but i still dont rate a whole movie on the second half,fantasy

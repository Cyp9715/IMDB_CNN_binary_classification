like so many modern hollywood moves looks and sounds great but is a poorly conceived and written and is ultimately not a good movie its another in a long list of movies that is technically excellent but uninspired and unfulfillingwhat killed the film for me was that it was utterly ridiculous from top to bottom from the opening scene you think you are watching something like the matrix but the movie never gets around to explaining how these assassins attain superpowers if i could train hard for a few months getting the sht beat out of me and bathing in krispy kreme sugar and somehow develop superpowers to defy all know laws of physics i would get started right away it wants to look and feel like reality but unlike comic book movies like ironman it asks you to swallow way more implausible nonsense than you may be able to stomach in fact ironman looks like a documentary compared to this noisy overdone rollercoaster i did not know going in that the movie was based on a comic about superheroes and supervillians they should have committed more to thatthere effort to make the movie real just made it a sloppy messso its a fantasy film that i found difficult to get into the action is well done the effects look great but its another case where you are lucky not to have an epileptic fit by the first hour from all the flash cutting and gimmicks half the movie is in bullet timeand then of course there is the loom which is just a retarded concept and in the face of everything else i found myself rolling my eyes if they had spent half the time they spent on effects working on the story we would all have been better off james mcavoy does his best with what hes given and its his performance that keeps the movie from slipping even further into the abyss jolie is always great but not given much to do here but look sexy,fantasy
the last line of this movie asks what the fword have you done lately if you didnt immediately answer i just spent two hours watching a really dumb movie then you must be an easily impressed video game enthusiast some interesting visuals aside its movies like this that give the term comic book movie a bad reputation unexplained gravity defying flipping cars curving bullets and rat bombs just push the envelope too far in to the land of the absurd the easily spotted plot turn does help but the rather uninspiring cartoon action just sinks it too many wtf moments in both the action and the plot to enjoy this movie unless you really relate to a frustrated nobody stuck in a deadend job and you want to fantasize about becoming an assassin i cant figure out what was worse the few matrix type rip offs or the bizarre rocky type killer training session also how did they manage to make angelina jolie so unattractive not only does she look anorexic but add in the god awful tattoos and there is nothing sexually appealing about the characterridiculous uninspired action mixed with possibly the dumbest plot of any movie this century means is one to avoid at all cost,fantasy
i was a bit apprehensive about this film from the previews and commercials what with the bending bullets and all but i figured with all of the action movies trying to outdo each othermaybe there would be a good story backing it however in the opening sequence when a man leaps several hundred feet to slay some assassins on another rooftop before being aced out from miles away i started to lose any hopes for a good movie then any further hopes were dashed when it was revealed that a magic god loom delivers a binary code that says who is to be killed how the frat discovered binary and secondly that the people named were to be killed is beyond me maybe godfatewhatever wrote to them in binary on the first sweater that was and told them to kill the named ever thereafter this whole godfate fate being spelled out when the explosive rat truck hit the mill door loom thing really blatantly pointed out the problems with dogmatic irrational beliefs that can be found running rampant throughout our society but speaking of that society its a shame to think that most people will be unable to find that point because it was buried behind quack gimics and special effects this movie made crank look like the godfather aside from the absurd story backing why the frat was assassinating people all of the stunts were merely an attempt to outdo movies like crank with timespace bending cg that makes anyone who has any inkling of what physics are want to cry if the timeslowing gimics were cut from the movie i think it would have maybe passed 30 minutes of film time i could maybe understand the rapid heartbeat to be able to react quicker to things modeled after a fight or flight type of response on crack or something but the bullet bending thing got to be a little too ridiculous by the end where a bullet can be fired around a 20 circumference and have the same gun tossed to someone else before the bullet returns from its 360 degree trip to kill the shooteri mean really i really to walk out of the theater about 30 minutes into this film there isnt enough room in this comment box to enable me to voice the downfalls of this film however i feel as though i must include this side note on society as well on top of whole fate and immovable beliefs tangent from above the fact that movies like this can go over well in america is a great example of how dumbed down culture is making usoh lets make an action movie with a loom that dictates who should live and who should dieoh yeaand the assassins can bone physics with no rationale as to howit truly made me sick what luck for rulers that men do not think  adolf hitler its understandable how we get leaders like george w bush when movies like this are not only accepted but admired now if you will excuse me i need to read my binary sweatshirt for what to eat tonight,fantasy
i am a massive james mcavoy fan since his shamelessuk days so was a bit iffy on how he would transfer to an action movie despite a fair performance from him even if his american accent is hard to believe and turns back to his native scottish every now and then my friend who dragged me along apologised profusely once the film had finished heres some of my problems with the film 1 the script if the script was good id be able to get over the lack a story line it started poor i was hoping for an upsurge but it never came making joliemcavoy freeman and the rest including the guy from hustle uk what was his point just look daft2 the first 20 mins at least is about how the main guys life is crap in the matrix this lasted about 5 minutes before getting into the action 3 all mcavoy does in the 2nd 20 mins is scream 4 how much slowmotion does one director need even the kissing scene really5 the twist really is cringeworthy  you can tell that the script read cross wesley im your father before they realised that george lucas had already used that line so they had to quickchange it to youre my sonone redeeming feature  you get to see morgan freeman say kill that motherfr i always knew he was samuel l jackson in disguiseaction wise its good if a bit unbelievable but thats what films are for and the special effects are ok shame about the script,fantasy
suspend all disbelief theres not a single element of realism in this movie  its a very sad attempt to try  make a comic into a movie then failing badly as the source material clearly wasnt strong enoughid normally class morgan freeman  angelina jolie as a good cast but sadly theyve got awful roles the script itself is truly dire based on a comic ive never read or heard of everbasically were in a world of superhero assassins where their abilities are right out of the matrix the film borrows heavily from things like bulletproof monk i dont actually think theres a single original idea in the whole movie and viewers are expecting to suspend way too much beliefthe film has too much action yes you read that right too much and suffers in the same way bad boys 2 did just having action scenes for the sake of it because there was no plot or script to follow so theyd just engineer an action sequence for no reason at all than seeing the hero or the other assassins use their magical powerswere following wesley gibson a nobody who is dragged into the world of the assassins and trains to become one to kill the man who killed his father except thats not the case the man he kills is his father and the guy in charge of the assassins morgan freeman in possibly his worst movie role ever has started to create targets for his own profitthe film is truly awful ignore the plot because its nonexistent enjoy looking at fox angelina jolie until she decides to kill herself near the end of the film terrance stamp is woefully underused  his character could have done much moreif you can ignore the ridiculous special effects cgi and over the top action sequences then you might get a bit of pleasure from watching this personally i hated it and if youve seen the trailers then youve seen the best bits of the movie as it really doesnt get any better than the trailer,fantasy
words cannot describe how awful this film isimagine if you will a hat full of random cgiheavy action scenes spill them on the floor and select the ones that turn upwards then edit them together so that they are almost coherent this isin the first five minutes you think that this will be a film to rival the matrix with cgi action that will blow you away as some guy its never revealed who he is leaps across from one building to the opposite one and kills five guys on a rooftop before being killed in spectacular fashionthen the film beginsa sad pathetic human starts moaning for far too long about how his life is crap this occupies a lot of celluloid and you start to think where has the action gone after some time passes i forget how long he joins a fraternity of assassins led by morgan freeman here he learns that his father who has been absent all his life was an assassin and can bend bullets round corners a trait shared by both morgan freeman and angelina jolie but its never explained why and other cool looking stuff so after some training getting smacked in the face a lot and doing some knife training he never uses he does a couple of rather impossible missionsat this point you think this isnt that bad and youd be rightits when morgan freeman reveals that the fraternity kill orders come from a bit of cloth on a loom that things go downhill are we told why the loom wants to kill people no maybe its an evil loomnow i was expecting a shadow organisation that was controlling things and the main characters father was behind all that noit turns out that morgan freeman has been lying about who the loom wants to kill and that it to kill him and every other member of the fraternity again never explained why so angelina jolie kills all the fraternity members who just happen to stand still long enough for one bullet to go through them all in a circle considerate and herselfthat leaving freeman and mcevoy  to battle it out or not in fact the same sequence from the first bit just happens all over againit should be called plotjust goes to show cool looking trailers do not a good film make,fantasy
this film is saturated with absurdity in an attempt to wow audiences with special effects they have already seen countless times in the likes of die hard and bourne nothing new in this film just a number of hollywood clichs including the sob story told by a narrator in the third person which ultimately turns out to be their own sob story and even the star wars idea of the central character seeking to avenge their fathers death only for the villain to say no i am your fatherthe rest of the plot comprises of special effects absurdity laughing at not with the film excessive blood and shooting and swearing and achieves nothing by doing so james mcavoy totally lets himself down in this role he was brilliant in last king of scotland but doesnt do himself justice as soon as he starts speaking in a pretty naff american accent his character isnt that believable and his excessive swearing makes him more unrealistic instead of realistic the rest of the cast including veteran morgan freeman are paperthin characters which also lets them down as actors as the characters die it is difficult to be upset as you barely know them or sympathise with themalthough there were some interesting twists in the end they fail to salvage a film thats only purpose was to try and lure people in with mindless violence blood and bad language with very little substance the script is also quite poor like many modern action films in my view this is trying to outdo goodfellas in violence bad language and blood but otherwise would fail miserably in competing on the scale of quality and credibility a further demonstration of unoriginality in hollywood filmmaking,fantasy
i am a huge fan of mark millars and so when i entered the theater with a friend on an advance screening pass comic book store owners are very nice people to befriend fear gripped me it has to suckright its hollywoodand a loose adaptationand so once the credits rolled and i was one of the many people laughing and clapping the fear had long passedthe films works it provides the amazing opiate of style and dark humor and in such massive quantities that both evoke the spirit of the source material and utterly ignore the latter 90 of the graphic novel but that independent streak works for you feel a sense of amused wonder and curiosity throughout and all the plot twists that follow are different enough from the source to actually hold your attention without ever being prematurely obviousjames mcavoy does an excellent job and his wry sarcastic narration sets the mood of the film perfectly his evolution from pansy to neo has a genuine and pleasantly arrogant feel to it although the stereotypical rockyesquire training montage is used to speed things up a bit what a tiresome tool basically his version of a cinematic neo is both smarter more entertaining and more intelligentbacking him up more with sexy looks and an im too cool for you youre not brad attitude than anything is angelina jolie her character screams trinity and loudly regardless watching her onscreen is a pleasure shes terribly likable and extremely lethal throughoutmorgan freemans morpheus called sloan here is played well although the role is a bit beneath his skill as an actor he makes it work though playing the wizened and mature helper very well more importantly he delivers an excellent and unexpected line that rivals samuel l jacksons memorable expression from snakes on a plane that alone makes any price of admission worthwhileany other character serves as nothing more than white noise there to populate the world rather than intriguethe theme of is all about taking charge of your life and making your own choices something that the very premise of the first hour of the film both adheres to and contradicts rather than analyze it here and waste time arguing the pleasantly mad logic of a movie where bullets bend stylishly ill leave that to the people who inevitably will assuming the bulletfu and gore dont completely captivate them and they should is violent truly and yet it doesnt strive to turn every frame into a gory actionpacked orgasm the film handles it with grace and a style i sorely wish more action movies took into considerationas bullets curve heads get punctured hilarity ensues and rats explode peanut butter rocks btw youll smile besides yourselfthis really isnt a superhero comic adaptationits the matrix with a great sense of humorenjoy it,fantasy
i know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the naysaying but i would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it sure the movie takes some liberties with plot and obviously physics but it makes for a fun actionpopcorn movie it is after all just a movie after seeing this film i would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008 its got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plotwesley gibson is a miserable account manager with a deadend life until he is approached by the beautiful fox who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before gibson is recruited into an assassins guild known as the fraternity to hunt down and kill his fathers murdererthe quirk with the fraternity is that its assassins have the special ability to raise their heart rate above 400 bpm pumping incredible amounts of adrenaline into their system and giving them superhuman reaction speedbasically bullettime so you can expect a lot of overthetop stunts including the ability to curve bullet paths why there has been a lot of complaints about this aspect of the movie i dont know its not really overused and it adds a cool element to the movie the film has plenty of action throughout though most of my favorite scenes were during the course of wesleys training with the fraternity the film also has a twist ending though it isnt difficult to see the truth comingfor a popcorn flick the film boasts a great cast morgan freeman is sloan the overseer of the fraternity and its the first time ive seen him in such a role he did seem a little awkward with some of the rougher dialogue towards the end of the film though i guess its to be expectedi never expected to hear freeman spouting kill this motherfa in a film angelina jolie is wonderfully sexy as fox though im biased to the point where id love jolie in just about any role rounding out the primary cast is james mcavoy as wesley gibson i had not seen any of mcavoys previous work but i loved his work in this movie he is perfectly suited to play both the meek anxietyridden account manager and the elite killer he becomes he does a great job inducing the element of dark humor into the film with his great deliverywhile ive read quite a few complaints about this film i cant understand why its a guiltypleasure action film and its not to meant to be taken completely seriously its just a movie and a fun one to boot when you watch this film just sit back disengage your brain and enjoy the nonstop action and fun characters,fantasy
this is a very easy to watch action packed movie it delved into your imagination and as long as you are not expecting a true to life action drama you should love it i am not normally struck on the matrix style movies but i really liked this film the story is not be taken too seriously just go with the flow of the film and watch the stunts and special effects putting angelina jolie and morgan freeman in the movie had to be a good move with the box office bucks but the ace card for this movie in my opinion is james mcavoy who plays the geeky guy who turns into a top assassin at first i did not recognize james mcavoy from his previous roles like  the last king of scotland  and  wimbledon  when i did realize it was the same actor i understood what a fab actor he truly is he portrays his character with absolute ease his transition in his role from the start of the movie to his ending character is class james i am a true fan  the movie is a good watch if you are into this type of movie,fantasy
mindless action films abound and can be fun this is not a mindless action film but its mind caters to nerdy dreams of becoming a morethanhuman being wouldnt we all like to suddenly have 35 million in our bank accounts tell off our extremely annoying boss is there any other kind and get trained as an ultraassassin then just shoot everybody they tell you to or have a quick case of conscience then shoot them  cool notone scene is ripped straight from the matrix series of films and the overall feeling is overwhelmingly matrixterminator perhaps its overoptimistic to look for something new in a movie of this type but theres hardly anything original this is not a film the world needs now  or ever,fantasy
putting it bluntly was a rather formulaic and predictable outing a loserly office shutin with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination a world of flipping cars extreme gun fights and mindaltering stunts thus shedding every bit of his shy weak self this weve all seen beforewhere stands apart from any other action film ive seen is in its style the director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed gone are any sort of boundaries this is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot if people can really do this perhaps im living the same existence as wesley and im missing out the films major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for thatthe alist cast delivers solid performances but the script they are given  with the exception of the last line uttered in the film  is mostly generic james mcavoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesnt know how to change it  something many people understand his transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing angelina jolie is fox  a name quite fitting as jolie looks fantastic however weve seen this character on her before still she does it well freeman as usual injects intelligence into his role playing the solemn leader of the fraternityhowever for all the edgy extreme events the film contains the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained for one the fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by the loom of fate sounding like something from a monty python sketch it is never revealed who  if anyone  controls the loom or where it derives its powers names are simply revealed through code and the members of the fraternity dont ask questions the members of the fraternity are fully human but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly its the films easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the highoctane action they desire lastly the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles awaywhen the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75 of the time but you wont care the film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mindbending stunts unique filmography and breathtaking visuals  yes ms jolie is one of them it will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story but in the execution of its stunts and action 710,fantasy
hollywoods apparent fascination with russian nightwatch helmer timur bekmambetov should good box office notwithstanding be efficiently assassinated by this stupid boring derivative inept and meanspirited messjames mcavoy plays neo sorry wesley a shmucky everyman who whilst shopping for his anxiety meds at a local pharmacy bumps into angelina jolie aka trinity or fox if you prefer who joins him for a pointless special effects sequence en route to an introduction with morpheus played by morgan freeman and who for arguments sake well refer to by the name hes given in the film sloane you get the idea this is put simply the paupers matrix it wouldnt make for particularly interesting reading for me to recount just how many similarities there are between the two films itd fill several hundred pages of doublesided a4 for a start but the overall difference in tone is mildly fascinatingit wasnt hard to empathize with neo in the earlier film the wachowski brothers clearly relished and nurtured the sense of wonder and excitement of his journey making the films stratospherical success easy to understand in after taking a plotunbalancing length of time to establish mcavoy as an ordinary joe who is a loser just like you a sentiment that the film keeps repeating it then turns him after his lengthy training sessions which amount to nothing more than him being repeatedly beaten and no i am not making this up into an arrogant belligerent ahole the film pukes its cards on the table most succinctly with its final line of dialogue after narrating his characters transformation for us over a sequence featuring yet another bloody slowmotion head shot mcavoy turns to the camera and says what the fk have you done lately which im happy to report resulted in a smattering of mild applause at the screening i attended not for the dialogue but for the truly estimable chap who screamed fk off at the screen as the credits began to roll all of this wouldnt matter if the film was any good at all but it aint the action sequences are murky and unimaginative the actors are given absolutely nothing to do morgan freeman in particular appears to be barely alive during his few brief scenes its derivative its stupid its condescending and its boring boy is it boringthis is the best approximation of a turkey that youre gonna see before thanksgiving chow down at your own risk,fantasy
i watched this movie the other day and i was actually quite excited however i was quickly turned from this opinion within the first 30 minutes of the movie it got progressively worse until the ending starting with the massmurdersuicide and then the replay  revenge hit at the end of the movie this ending was simply painful morgan freeman is killing his career with movies like this i appreciate the writers ability to adapt graphic novel to the big screen but in all honesty this has to be the worst comic book or graphic novel movie ever save yourself the time and do something that will at least stimulate your brain read the book forget the movie,fantasy
i just got back from an advanced screening of i have to admit not being a fan of the director tim bekmambetov somewhat disappointed in his russian films nightwatch and daywatch however in his american directorial he delivers an abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond xtreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques humor and acting james mcavoy the sweet faun from the chronicles of narnia plays the loser we all know wesley gibbon the guy who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon humiliated and has no desire to escape it except in a bottle of antianxiety meds enter a beautiful woman fox angelie jolie a mysterious wise man sloan morgan freeman and his life instantly changes from billing reports to gratuitous violence mastering weaponry skills and assassination believe me when i say what the matrix introduced has mastered the director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of wesley like i have never seen before wait i take that back seen it in nightwatch i definitely recommend this deliberately humorous action packed violent profane totheextreme film to be seen on the big screen  check this one out,fantasy
i guess this is my first moment i want to comment on the movie the reason for that is all those negative commentspeople dont like the idea of a man making a giant leap across buildings about the plot of the world and the ridicule in the moviebut at the same time i guess they did like trinitys jump in matrix destiny sadame in any japanese movie or comedy of mr and mrs smithcome on people this is not james bond bourne or die hard this is exactly the opposite this movie in my opinion simply tries to make fun of all those movies its all a sarcastic view of todays action movies just like the bullets  bent to the fullest for me its more of an action comedy the ideas are so stupid that its funny why because it was fit in the action movie i mean come on  the loom the bullets the healing stearine the rats how can you ever compare it to any action movie that tries to be serious this is not trying to do that thats why i liked this movie  for its intelligent sarcasm and probably because of all the negative comments from people that expected a mature action movie and didnt understand the movie,fantasy
a little bit of a spoiler in all honesty i was expecting somethingdecent ive seen a lot of movies lately and i wasnt exactly looking for anything to blow me away so i went in with low expectations where do i begin i felt like the entire movie was just an excuse for violence to call this an actionthriller is quite the stretchi would have gone with comedygorethe music was a bit more serious than the actual plot could back up and i walked out thinking wait what was his name whered he come fromat first it was alright i understood they lost me 10 minutes into the movie picked me back up then lost me again when he went body surfing on his fatheri liked the twist although i had the turning of the characters pegged from the beginning all in all seriouslywaste of moneyi was disappointed with imdb users when i saw such a high rating,fantasy
i left this film shaking my head in disgust at the worthless corrupt and ethicallybankrupt sewer that hollywood has become i knew i was going to a violent action film i knew its story was about assassins and i am neither religious nor squeamish about screen violence when it serves a good story  but i did not agree to have my face rubbed in corpses of little old ladies impaled on meat hooks and used as firing range targets in geysers of blood bone brains and random gore spurting in extreme closeup and slomo from the craniums of morgan freeman angelina jolie and 48 for 50 minor others then repeated in reverse hollywood is sick it is so devoid of able writers that its reduced to serving up buckets of gratuitous graphic gore and human atrocities sufficient to nauseate josef mengele so as to fill that gaping void where a coherent story and more importantly a civilized code of ethics ought to bein yet another of hollywoods weird adolescenttype cries for help this film is yet another packed with gratuitous beavis  buttheadcaliber profanity between every fourth or fifth word of dialog its that thing where teenagers think that grownuptype bad words will impress all observers into ooohs and aaaahs and thereby obscure desperatelyconcealed deficiencies of character or maybe these writers assume their presumptive audience will be just as juvenile as they rather pathetic in any case now epidemic in hollyweird again i am specifically not a wctutype religious fundamentalist  but it doesnt take much mental effort to understand the contempt for humanity and the impotent frustration with life that are implicit to gratuitous profanity to hear actors of the caliber of morgan freeman agreeing to deliver that pathetic tripe is just painful on the plus side there were some excellent action sequences and enjoyable spectacle  the train derailment sequence and the car chases managed to be original even balletic none of the action in this film was plausible in context of basic physics of course but the film managed to suspend disbelief adequately to compensateunfortunately along with the walltowall human butchery and pottymouth dialog the story never rose above lame and sloppy the intrigue of a secret order was quickly abandoned as a mere detail of setting the loom of fate apparently ran itself since no explanation was given as to who or what set it in motion the actors almost to a one were mere foils for extravagant and again atrocious visuals i wont even bother to go into the contemptible sling blade ethic of murder is aok if you have a good reason suffice it to stand as a stark reminder of where hollywoods proctological worldview has inevitably taken itbottom line is a film that left me feeling in equal parts annoyance disappointment and an overpowering desire to go home and wash,fantasy
very poor movie even if you forgive the plot which is like something written by a person whose brain was seriously damaged in a bad accident thats exactly what this movie is a bad accident it starts off fairly promising though i deliberately didnt read any reviews or anything about it because i like to be pleasantly surprised by a movie which i have no preconceptions ofit all goes wrong when the main character is in a drugstore getting his panicattack pills and angelina jolie suddenly appears beside him and starts telling him his father is an assassin and he just died then all hell breaks loose and so begins the painfully overthetop chase scene which eventually leads to more ridiculous scenes such as a bath full of wax which is meant to heal all his wounds in a day and a magic loom that magically spells out secret binary messages in the stitching of people they must assassinate of course what were not told is which side of the piece of cloth we should look at at which stich we should start reading from and when we do get a persons name how do we know who to kill if there happens to be more than one person with that namei am usually able to suspend my disbelief during a movie and thus enjoy and be entertained by it but with this movie i just couldnt and if your iq is above 50 you wont either,fantasy
if you watch this movie with a closed mind you might not care for itjust take it as it is and it is very good the special effects are excellent and action is nonstopped there are plenty of jawdropping moments in this moviechances are that most of the stunts are highly unlikely but youre watching a movie purpose to entertain its like watching a superhero movie no spiders dont make men that shoot webs or rage that turns someone into a superhuman green giant but they do entertain i was very entertained if you like action check this movie out and you will not be disappointed,fantasy

for the first half hour felt like a traileradapted from a graphic novel the film never seems to settlethe actors seem ill at ease with the material and the impatience on the directors part leaves us with a messy hackneyed film of action set pieces and sci fi mumbo jumbo inbetween the film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less hastejames mcavoyso convincing in last king of scotland is hard to like in this rolemorgan freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenesangelina jolie is the real star of this filmshe has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genreits just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star inin summary is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very littleit leaves you wanting,fantasy
is a nonstop tour de force of preposterous scene after preposterous scene what you get is something you would expect from a comic book movie the only problem is if you havet read the comic book every farfetched ridiculous plot point and scene seems just that farfetched and ridiculousso what about the action scenes the preview made it look great right if you like beautifully crafted action scenes then you are in for a rock and roll time for about 25 percent of the movie if that whenever an action scene pops up it does something exciting and fun to watch and then suddenly disappears in an instant leaving us with our narrator and central character wesley droning on and on for the next 20 or so minutesand what else do we get with him aside from a poor chicago accent we get a very boring unsympathetic character who is able to accept his fate without any real believable scrutiny and somehow miraculously learns to become the best assassin ever in a matter of about two weeks or so and dont get me started on how all of these amazing assassins all throughout the film drop like flies one after another while none of them can compete with our hero wesley who just picked up the job a short while ago but i suppose i should concede something i mean wesley does have his amazing 400 heartrate that gives him adrenaline instead of a heart attackbut wait theres more we also have the wonderful privilege of his incessant whining about his pathetic life it is a style of narration extremely reminiscent of edward nortons character in flight club ill paraphrase for you i am a loser who buys ikea furniture and who wades through life without meaning you are a loser too you and i are just alike keep watching me in all my loserness and i will keep pointing out to you in every other scene that you are a loser too despite not actually being a loser i found this to be quite aggravating i didnt pay ten bucks for a movie to be told over and over again that i am doing nothing with my life does hollywood or at least the films writersdirector really believe that because someone is at a movie that they are as big of a loser as our little character wesley here and the last line of the film simply sealed that annoyance for mebut it wasnt all bad if you like angelina jolie she looks just as good in this as she has in previous shoot em up thrillers moreover you even get to see her partially naked so who can argue with that right and what about all of those awesome action scenes i mentioned on the rare occasion they actually popped up i admit they were indeed fun and entertaining albeit unbelievableunfortunately i found myself in disbelief at all of the phenomenal feats they were accomplishing throughout the feature during said action scenes our main character as well as others has the unique ability to pump out an over 400 heartrate giving them nasty abilities like jumping tall buildings in a single bound and slowing down time and most of all the uncanny ability to curve the angle of bullets as they are firednow i am not one without an ability to suspend disbelief shooting wings off the fly sure curving a bullet as its fired so it can slightly bend around an object and hit something behind it sure why not but when it comes right down to it when you have a single bullet fired from a gun and it curves around a 360 degree angle blowing through 9 different skulls of the most prominent assassins in the world and the bullet flies in a perfect circle killing everyone with no ducking or anything sorry angelina who fired this bullet is just human and bullets just dont do that and in the end or more specifically about halfway through the preposterousness that is this film all i was for one of those bullets to fire off curve its way through the movie screen and just end the torture,fantasy
my wife and i have become used to really good movies with great plots and the occasional bit of action without the raunchy language and pornwe should have read more about this mess before we attended the plot was almost nonexistent the actors went through the motions like robots and the language was strictly adolescent it shows a great lack of writing talent to be limited by one fourletter word that has to come out of every characters mouth in every scenewe walked out in disgust will tell our friends and family to skip this trash and certainly hope the sequel doesnt happenwhy morgan freeman and angelina jolie appeared in this trash is the biggest mystery evidently money is more important than decency they were the only reason we attended in the first place we plan to let them know how we feel,fantasy
as action movies go they dont get much better then thisthe action scenes were amazing i was sitting on the edge of my seat on more than one sequence of course some of its a bit far fetched but come on arent most action movies james macavoy did an amazing job playing the average joe who is suddenly told he has the ability in him to be a wolf among the sheep i enjoyed his american accent angelina was great she does very well in roles like this and even though she doesnt have too many lines she pulls off her character who truly believes in what she does very well plus shes hot i mean im a woman who doesnt particularly even like tattoos and i have a crush on her  in all i highly recommend this movie great summer entertainment,fantasy

i wasnt excited to see im back in america for the summer and i was going to the movies with a friend and she has what can only be called an unhealthy obsession with angelina jolie so of course this was at the top of the list of movies to see personally i dont understand a lot of the hype about her as an actor but i have to admit she looks good with a gun so i decided to check out the moviein perusing some of the reviews on the imdb it seems that people either loved it or hated it i liked it a lot although you have to understand that its what i call an overthetop action movie where everything is taken to the extreme see shoot em up with movies like this the goal is spectacle not realism hence all of these piddly complaints about the physics involved in bending bullets are rendered meaninglesswhy would you complain about realistic stunts when cars can flip through the air with precision and then accelerate off the side of a bus or when superassassins can throw bullet curveballs is it not obvious what that this is not exactly cinema verite i have to agree that some of the plot devices are a little witless a magic loom that weaves fate come on but the action is outstanding to say the least angelina has clearly been working on her war face every time she fired her gun and showed that grimace i could only imagine her in her cavernous mansion practicing for hours on end in front of a mirror but especially in comparison to a lot of the garbage sent to theaters these days the entertainment is highthe movie is loud fast and explosive but not exactly a cognitive workout its great as an hour and a half of action entertainment and its also fun to pick out the scenes that feed off of other films the most obvious to me being office space one of my favorite comediesi have only recently become aware of james mcavoy after seeing the last king of scotland and atonement which in a single shot features by mcavoy one of the finest pieces of acting ive ever seen in a movie  see my atonement review and while he doesnt exactly knock my socks off here with his performance hes perfect for the role and pulls off a disillusioned bluecollar american perfectly add him to the list of british actors so talented that many moviegoers didnt even know he was britishto a greater extent than mcavoy obviously the great morgan freeman is also clearly just having a good time here the material is distantly below his talents as it is for mcavoy but at the same time i see no reason why actors of his caliber shouldnt do a movie like this every once in a while shoot em up as well is also distantly below the talents of clive owen but man he was good in it angelina jolie however fits right in here because this is the kind of movie that she is best in i am thrilled by the way to have read that she has been ordered to gain weight for her next role partly so she will be attractive again and partly so she wont faint on set like she did while making this movieat any rate i wont say to ignore all of the bad press about the movie because its true that a lot of people wont like it but it seems a perfect example of a movie that if you go in with the right state of mind it can be great fun the cleverness of the highly choreographed stunts for me often outweighed my lack of belief enjoy,fantasy
this comment has spoilers timur bekmambetov who scored with the night watch films comes to america againthe first time he was working for roger corman and makes a visually arresting but other wise incredibly stupid action film the plot of the film has wesley gibson james mc avoy an account manager who is as put upon as they come recruited by a band of assassins in order to be trained to kill the man who killed his father one of the men who had leading the assassins there are some twists and turns but mostly its an excuse for some really good looking set pieces that are worth the effort to see them on tv when this finally hits cable as for the twists and turns there are maybe two and they are so late in the game as to be purely an excuse to keep the movie going until its reached the two hour markthis is a a seventy minute film stretched to two hours for no good reason the simplistic retelling of the plot is how simple the film is it actually removes any clichd notions of films with similar plots by excising any notions of exposition it does this because the script doesnt really provide any sort of story or real characters part of the problem is that the film has a series of set pieces that take away from any notion of character development there is no time when you have to get to the next fight or training scene so no onenot even mcavoy arc they just are sure mcavoys character changes but its as if someone flipped a switch not grows overtime whats worse is the fact that the world the characters live in isnt real not even remotely only the characters can do super things and they do so in away that isnt believable we really dont know why or how other than training it makes no senseactually they cut out that this is based on super villains vs superhero storyactually nothing makes sense even its own twisted film world in the night watch films there are similar stunts and action but a world is created where all of the weirdness could happen here there is nothing these people exist and havent been found out despite doing fantastical things and we have to take it on faith and we have to accept that and everything else the film tells us you see its not just in the action scenes whole concepts in the film just ring as false because there is no reason for it the loom for example worst of all is the healing bath shades of ras al ghuls lazarus bath which is used so that mcavoy can get the stuffing kicked out of him over and over again its a cheat of the worst sort the film makers have asked us to believe way too much i can suspend disbelief up to a point but you cant give me 12 things to believe and not give me any means of supportto be certain the action scenes are great to be honest they are pure cgi but they still are incredible pieces of visual ballet the problem is that because the story is lacking i can only admire the visuals i cant love them because there is no reason to take them as anything other then as set pieces unconnected to anythingon some level the motion and pretty pictures entertained me but at the same time i felt i wasted a couple hours of my life honestly i havent felt this bad in a long time even with all the trash grade z movies i watchthis was two hours i will never get back what makes it really painful is the action works the acting is there but the script was clearly stuck in the word processorwait for cable,fantasy
right first things first this is an extremely enjoyable action movie but for it to work for you must suspend your sense of disbelief with this done there is much to be enjoyed here the premise of an agent order of assassin weavers is lets face it pretty ropey and i am not sure how true it is to the comic source material which i will probably dig out at some point and morgan freeman is really playing it by numbers here but we have some amazing and original action sequences that really do move the movie on at a frenetic pace yes we can see the massive influence of the matrix and fight club and lets just hope if there are sequels they do not go the way of the shoddy follow ups to the matrix i like the fact that some of the characters are played by different actors than your normal action movie types though to be honest i am not sure about mcavoys american accent though he handles everything else well still much better than your average action movie and worth repeat viewings if you are a fan of the genre,fantasy
i had the chance to see an advanced screening of this movie if it was out already i would have went and seen it again has pushed the limits of what an action movie should be just as the matrix did they could not have picked better actors to be in this movie james mcavoy wesley brings a dorky dark humor to the movie angelina jolie brings a cocky bad ass tone and morgan freeman well what movie isnt he perfect in everything from the plot action scenes special effects and overall acting all perfect from beginning to end is flawless i wont give away anything just be sure that you go see this movie its totally worth it,fantasy
perhaps the worst movie ive ever seen it starts out as you would think with the typical induction and revolting unnecessary but thankfully short partial nudity and it moves on to some cool shooting and so on but then you find out the fraternity is getting kill orders from a cloth weaving loom so your weirded out and after that you find that the bad guy is really a good guy and is the main characters father so as you have a flashback to star wars it moves forward and you find out that the fraternity is corrupted and everyone is supposed to die except the main character so what happens everyone dies but the main character and as the main character snipes the last bad guy he looks at the screen and says what have you done latelyall in all i would say this is a great movie that was royally screwed by some jerk of a writer who thinks he has a sense of humor,fantasy

acting horrible the dialog and acting is almost as ridiculous as the film itself not really much else to say the lines are especially lame along with no means of talented acting no amount of good acting could really save the dumb plot and really lame twist at the endplot if you are reading this and have yet to see the movie then you probably already know the basic plot what you dont know is the that the fraternity of assassins select their jobs from reading the secret code that some ancient loom provides there is no further explaining in the film other than its all because of fate looms decide peoples fate come on the main character wesley gibson is accepted into the faternity because he is skilled enough to shoot the wings off of live flies he completes his assassin training by slowing his reflexes down enough to catch a shuttle in the loomspecial effects not very special high budget films with todays standards should have good special effects the special effects are very similar to the matrix and a lot of the concept for the action scenes were lame knock offs the movie suffers from being ultra cheesy and unrealistic bullets are curved with the twist of a hand this is called curving the bull bullets are also used to shoot other bullets and deflect them a car is purposely flipped in the air upside down to shoot an enemy in another car through their sun roof the airborne car of course lands perfectly all in slow motion the movie constantly switches to slow motion it is often a misconception that putting scenes in slow motion makes them cool nothing in the film looks even close to being realistici feel sorry for you if your curiosity leads you to waste you money on a theater ticket hopefully if this is true for you its a matine showing,fantasy
was walking by my local multiplex saw a friend in line for one of those freebie sneak previews i used to go to all the time too many horrible movies and such caused me to abandon this way of seeing filmseveryone was happy to see me and when i asked about the movie they were going to see they said two words angeline joliei nearly bolted ajs movies by and large have not been happy events for me but i sort of recalled a few seconds of the preview something about a train splitting apart on a bridge i figured what the heck so i let them find me a pass and i went in and told myself if this is bad just leavethe opening sequence of the movie was amazing bloody gory and maybe a little too much like the matrix and if i have one qualm with a movie i gave 10 bleeding stars to it is that the matrix is stamped all over itmind you the actors here are far and away better than that former film the script based on a graphic novel shudders is really weak on some key points but the overall effect of the film is this you leave shaking feeling like youve just gotten off the best thrill ride at the best theme park on the planetif they did this thing in imax 3d id pay good money to see it againas it is i just want to buy the directors cut dvd  nowis ajs face more impressive than her acting sure but shes one of the most beautiful women ever filmed so thats like saying shes only a great actress not a phenomenal one do i hate the way our hero blows up an enemy installation heck yeah the folks at peta are going to be all over this movie and rightfully sois it sort of s and m kinky the way it keeps beating the crap out of its hero does it milk every sexy moment possible out of the beauty of virtually every cast member well of coursebut lets face it we go to see these films to live at these heightened levels fall down a chasm and not die sure bend the path of bullets why not french kiss one of the most beautiful women on the planet in front of your shrew of an ex go for it and while youre at it go see this fine film ps the same guy who directed night watch and day watch directs here and this guy has a future lets just hope he doesnt selfdestruct,fantasy
i went to a screening of last night in toronto it was more than i hoped for james mcavoy was the perfect leading man at the beginning you felt for him being such a loser and then you grow with him through the movieangelina jolie did not have a large part in the movie she was there but there was not much focus on her which suited me just finethe only gripe i can have with this movie is that near the end there were bits that seemed predictable not the whole thing but little parts here or theretimur bekmambetov did an amazing job directing this and i am looking forward to more product from him in the future,fantasy
the underlying premise of this movie is not bad but the movie is here are some questions it left me with why is there a giant meat locker in a textile factory how does repeatedly beating someone up train them to be an assassin how does the ability to curve a bullet all of the sudden translate into guiding it on a zigzag path all the way across town how does being an elite organization of assassins also give you the ability to manipulate banking transactions why does an assassin especially one that uses a gun need to be proficient in handtohand combat if everyone at the textile factory is actually also an assassin why isnt the new guy trained to run the textile machines when the head of an organization is corrupt why do you need to kill everyone in the organization why did they need to steal the bank scene from matrix especially when it doesnt make sense why steal darth vaders no i am your father when there was no reason to keep it a secret why does the magic healing water sometimes coat over with wax sometimes not doesnt shooting a gun with a blocked barrel result in a backfire instead of launching the blockage,fantasy
basic storyline is a clich but good action scenes and all pretty goodbut the details of the story the lets teach someone to fight or be an assassin by beating him up training with live metal cars chases and car flips that could only be performed through calculations on a nasa supercomputer adrenalin junkies jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper and everything is over dramatized straight from the creative writing story of an 8 year oldrated r for ridiculous retardedif you shut off all reasoning and just go for the thrill ride and seeing aj naked booty it is worth it you know like a porno dont try to think or reason just enjoy,fantasy
this film really is wish fulfilment of the worst and most degrading kind this was created by the same man who shat the unbelievably bad night watch on an unsuspecting world this is a film that you can genuinely feel making you stupider as you watch itspoilerjames macavoy has a rubbish job and an unpleasant best friend who is having an affair with his annoying girlfriend fortunately is recruited by a group of uberassassins descended from weavers in the 10th century these weavers discovered binary code and a method for reading their weaving i can just imagine how that one went oi yorrickive discovered a way to read the weaving really what does it say its a name brilliant clearly we should kill them weavers do that rightnot content with coming up with the worlds dumbest method for finding targets they also enjoy making life difficult for themselves theyve discovered a way to bend bullets in mid flight and this allows them to be significantly more crap than regular assassins there is one particularly spiffing scene where james and ms jolie who spends the whole film looking like a particularly unwell bag of coathangers with tattoos that classily scream crack whore assassinate someone in a boardroom from the top of a moving train given that one character can shoot people from five miles away with a special flintlock rifle i am wondering why just sitting across the street with a regular hunting rifle was out of the question for these idiots morgan freeman new conservatory mr f phones in his worst performance ever as the completely bored leader of the weaver assassins they also make clothes he needs james to kill the rogue agent who killed james father the whole thing plays out with with the same sense of relentless invention and excitement youd get watching dogs mating end spoilerfrankly if there is one film this year that you should avoid seeing it should be i am however happy to see that director timur talentlesshackovitch is clearly influenced by the early work of that master of wnk uwe boll with however he has graduated from incomprehensible gibberish any of the night day twilight just after dawn thirteen minutes to noonwatch films to unredeemable crap in a few years time he may have just about learned how to make something that is simply laughably bad,fantasy
i have no problem with grossly unrealistic action movies shoot em up even more unbelievable than was equally more enjoyable the narration by mcavoys character is vapid and annoying the movie has only one character that is remotely likable wesleys real father who unfortunately gets very little screen time and struggles to build a story solely around impossible assassination attempts basing these assassinations on a system of random variations in a loom attributing the secret codes to fate is just too much too take finally the twist towards the end is completely predictable for anyone actually paying attention to the movie could have benefited from either more fun better writing or more angelina jolie but as it is will remain the most overhyped summer blockbuster of the year,fantasy
this movie sums up all thats wrong with modern culture  it glorifies mindless excessive brutal sadistic violence from one end to the other its morally confused it exudes an air of contempt for everyone and it has the most childish philosophy of meaningbecoming a man  or even an authentic human being  in this movie means becoming the best possible killing machine growing up means becoming just like your father the movie tries to justify the cult of assassins and then gives up and just wallows in a sadistic voyeuristic pornographic love of bloodshed for its own sake the director cant show a body without including a quick closeup of the bloodiest possible wound the most gratuitous beatings are piled up one on top of another till my wife just got up and walked out she got her money back this is the perfect movie for the goresoaked video game crowdthere are some terrific john woolike ballets of legitimate action and some great stylistic effects but its too bad some obvious talent is being wasted in the service of corpseworship at the end of the film the protagonists exults in his killings and invites the audience to follow his lead i left in disgust,fantasy
this movie is based on a comic book so crying about physics and cgi is pointlessyou whine about this but praise mivies like terminator and robocop most reviewers on here are so pretentious and use words like tripe trope and cliche this is a great movie decent adaptation of a comic book great action movie in general angelina is too skinny for you go watch girls,fantasy
this film is great while im not unaware the film has probably received some harsh criticism from a few critics this film isnt one to miss and thats for sure the first reason to enjoy this film is because of timur bekmambetovs creative directing style seeing as the film is based more or less on a comic one can enjoy its very comic moments as i did the characters are interesting and keep you hooked till the credits roll and trust me will not bore you james mcavoy is perfect as wesley and many other alist actors manage to appear in this flick including angelina jolie as the sexy fox and morgan freeman as the plotting sloan the story is a crazy one at best but its good enough to sit through and it does have its moments the ending is one that may or may not take you by surprise but it definitely had me guessing the comedy is well served in my opinion one of my favorite scenes is definitely when wesley expresses his true feelings to his anorexic boss janice and best friend barry the action as anyone watching the trailer could assume is fantastic and pure adrenaline fueled technically impossible stunts quite a mouthful but one surely will not be disappointed with this aspect of the film either especially the train scene incredible not only this but danny elfman does an awesome score may not be perfect but its still one hell of a ride and a definite must see i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
best way to view this as an action comic book where youll need to go with things and accept the bending of physical lawspros great special effects no compromises on the characters or the violence eg didnt get hung up on whether the violence would be perceived as gratuitous excellent premiseplot but  see the cons and convincing acting despite the cons i loved the movie cons needed more time presenting the internal strife and transformation of the main character in all areas  assassinations move to the different life etc  ie take notes from spiderman 2 the breakdown  prebreakthrough training sessions along with the ultimate breakthrough didnt give me the needed sense of intense struggle as the former conditioning broke away and  i groaned at the onedimensional toocomicbookylike character in the limo who was assassinated  his reaction was silly,fantasy
its really hard to shoot films based on the cartoons and not to repeat some common features creators of have managed it both storyline and acting look absolutely original one can compare with matrix and in some case its true the movie is as stunning unexpected and captivating as wachovsky bros early work was dont try to analyze what you see while you are in the cinema just watch and youll feel yourself inside the constant actionbekambetov who has started his shooting career from russian tvads in early 1990s loved cgi and camera effects from the very beginning now with a sufficient amount of hollywoods money he realizes his early dream cgi in isnt an addition to the storyline but the storyline itself,fantasy
seriously what is wrong with all the people who hated this movie what were you expecting this movie made no claims of greatness in its trailers it is what it set out to be a straight up balls to the wall action flick with a shred of plot well on that it delivered big time and then some if you are an action fan then you owe it to yourself to see this i just went out and blind purchased the blu ray and it was well worth my 24 bucks this is one kick a action flick my taste in movies is very diverse and iam proud to have this in my collection now if you judge a film based on what it promised to be then this movie is a 10 anyone that only watched the first 30 mins and decided they hate it has no room to judge this movie i might have felt the same if id done that but be fair take it for what it was intended to be mindless popcorn fun and its one hell of a ride,fantasy
definitely a great beer and pizza movie with some lazy friends on a friday night but a philosophical masterpiece about work ennui and nihilism i think notlook the point is action is action and here the action is just fine unlike crank or shootem up however it cant find a post modern humor to it it just plays the action too straight and too improbable and the word that spring to mind is bathoshowever philosophy is great only if really tight and not pop dollops of pseudo meaning  there is not enough explanation its all very mysterious but simply not mystic enoughi would have liked less bullets and knives and more creativity in the action scenes  and finally at the end of the day the film cant cram in all we need to know in the time continuum providedgood if violent entertainment but a good film uh huhno way,fantasy
was by far one of the very best action movies this year it was a very fun wild ride from start to finish it had many twists turns gore blood and action just strap in and get ready for one hell of a roller coaster ride it kind of got confusing at some parts in the movie so you have to pay attention very close you would be surprised how many funny parts and jokes they had in this movie i was also stunned by all the twists and turns the movie took toward the end by the end of this movie it will leave you shocked the acting could not have been any better angelina jolie did an amazing job playing an assassin james mcevoy was funny but also at the same time very serious when it came down to killing people morgan freeman was very good as usual and brought a lot to this film the stunts in this movie have no words to describe how good they were the gun techniques were outstanding some of the things they do with the gun though is very fake and farfetched i think that the movie was even better because of it getting an r rating this movie definitely deserved one and you will notice during the movie if it didnt get the r rating it wouldnt have been a s good as it was overall this movie is a must see movie it is worth every penny to go see it the one must see movie of the year is,fantasy
so a friend told me how the book was very different from the movie and made me read the book and boy was he right but more about that lateri recall seeing one of the producers say in an interview that due to all the superhero movies out they intentionally went for a more realistic approach i kept this in mind as i watched this movie that said i can only say that its good not greatjames mcavoy who ive been a fan of since rory oshea was here does an acceptable job as the movies main character however i couldnt help but notice his accent seem to be just a little off here and there which was a little distracting for me morgan freeman and angelina put in some reliable albeit unremarkable roles and common a guy who has more on screen gravitas than most actors is sadly underusedthe action scenes which are vital for a film like this are very good there are plenty of okay that was pretty cool moments for adrenaline junkies out there fyi mcavoy actually did the on the car hood stunt with no cg nice job the story is good but considering the original story it would have been really hard to make a horrible movie the special effects do a good job of making you believe in the unbelievable and some interesting camerawork and slowmo also do well to enhance the experienceall in all above average but not outstanding 6 out of 10 bonus commentary the real tragedy about this movie is what it could have been the original comic book wasnt about him being an assassin you see it was about him training to be a supervillian thats right in a superhero world hes the green goblin or lex luthor or even the joker now imagine what that movie would have been like additionally they had to train him to be a coldhearted homicidal remorseless bad guy the book which is definitely not for kids is chock full with so much fyou inyourface unapologetic violence this version of the movie would have been looking at an r rating for sure anyway if you get a chance track down the book and have a read you can thank me later,fantasy
please dont disregard me as an attentionseeking reviewer im a christian and went to see this film yesterday with some friends and i was disgusted by itrather than leaving as i definitely should have i sat through two violent and offensive sex scenes and another ninety minutes of exaggerated and unnecessary violencethe movie had no point no plot or resolution angelina jolies character in the film made me think is this what society has come down to sex is for the bedroom violence for the criminalsi can cope with violence in films and enjoy fastpaced movies such as the bourne series movies however this movie is twice as violent and pointlessly soplease consider the consequences of watching such a movie if you are religious then you will undoubtedly be sinning by watching it if you are like most individuals thoughtful and moralistic then you will be as disgusted as mei was ashamed at myself for sitting through thisthankyou for reading my comments,fantasy
lets be honest here the only saving grace for this movie is its cast even the excessive action scenes seem to lack a specific dash of substance that other actions films have they were too focused on style the movie tried to address an underlying message yet the only real reason why this was made was to lure a large audiencethe message is that one should take control over his or her life if i could curve bullets and bathe in wax i know i too could be just like wesley gibson alas im not but theres more to taking control over my life than learning how to curve bullets and let pieces of woven fabric dictate who i kill nextif you already watched fight club dont waste your time on this that movie did everything better from the ikea references to getting back at the evil bossthe most interesting thing about the plot is the loom of fate i thought it was wonderful how the loom chooses the next line of people to have dead in the ending you realize that even if youre meant to be killed and you avoid it it will be inevitable due to fate its a great balance of power preventing fraternity members from retaining too much still i found the plot to be dry and not very inspiredthis is a good year for escapist entertainment if you still havent watched this please watch something else if you are so eager to see go to the official website and watch the trailer because about 90 of the movies good scenes are in the trailers minus the infamous nude shotupped a few stars for at least having an imaginative ending a stellar cast and beautiful aesthetics,fantasy
warning contains plot spoilerswhat the f have you done latelyoh something tells me theyre going to regret closing this hackneyed insipid rubbish with that line im sure im not the only person who upon hearing that replied with well been screwed out of 6 for this piece of trashas much as i hate mentioning such outstanding films in the same breath as it tries to take elements of the stylish breathtaking action from the matrix attempts to copy the dark sharp witted humour from fight club and fuse them together to make an unforgettable cinematic experience works fine on paper in fact looking back over that i rather like the sound of itthis shocker of a film however ranks in the same league as the appalling doomsday and that really is saying something james mcavoy plays wesley an ordinary office worker who is frustrated by his tedious repetitive lifestyle and yearns for something more believe me after enduring 20 entire minutes of this being made painfully obvious youll completely empathise he soon meets angelina jolie the cue for the first of the movies many gratuitous action scenes i never thought i would hear myself say this but this film had too much action so much of it is unnecessary and crowbarred in solely for the sake of itthe fella apparently trying to kill mcavoy is later revealed to be his father although makes no attempt to inform his son of this at this particular moment or at any other time they meet well until wesley has just fired a bullet into his chest the luke im your father plot line completely sums up the extent of original concepts this film has to offerthe scenes where wesley is being beaten half to death as some sort of initiation rite to gain entry into the fraternity a league of assassin weavers from 1000 years ago are again pointless and while im not opposed to graphic scenes when they serve a purpose its all just so unnecessary hes then placed in a bath of an unknown solution which heals his wounds just so they can squeeze even more torture in and still have it make sensemorgan freeman plays sloane the leader of the fraternity in quite easily the worst most uninspired role i have ever seen him cast in he explains to mcavoy that they take their orders from a loom yeah just think about that for a second a giant loom of fate no less in which discrepancies in the stitching eventually spell out the name of the next person to be killed by way of binary code an idea born out of minimum thought and executed with way too muchwesley discovers that sloane is now just making the hits up as he goes along and so begins one of the worst plot devices ever conceived he rounds up 1000 rats by filling a garbage truck with peanut butter and then attaches bombs to each of them before crashing said truck into the gates of the fraternity building and setting them lose they quickly infiltrate each and every area of the building and subsequently destroy it in the space of about a minute yeah they disperse into even numbers and happen to end up everywhere even upstairs inside a minute surely the garbage lorry would still reek of peanut butter so why would they even leave itafter crashing in through a window mcavoy then charges through the building while gunning down a multitude of sloanes men a shameful ripoff of the matrixs famous lobby scene by this point predictably sloppy and for a final set piece surprisingly bland this leads to the scene where sloane is confronted and it is revealed that he alone is behind the hits nobody else within the fraternity had any idea this does mean that wesley has just slaughtered countless completely innocent men who wholeheartedly if blindly believe they are doing the right thing this coldblooded mass murder is completely overlooked and the final dreary scene plays out packed with yet more implausible tripehow on earth this movie has scored a 75 to date on this site is beyond me i can only pray that nobody with the power to churn out this kind of garbage is paying attention,fantasy
god when nothing catches your eye in the list of movies at your local cinema then avoid these films at all costsi want to go back and watch a good movie on my 21st but since i cant ill have to just bash this till it turns into a cubethings i hated1 the main character mr wooden block mr 2 expressions only mr monotone mr sudden 6 pack after years in a desk job mr panic attacks and displaced anger2 curving bullets this was an incredibly boring phenomenon can someone explain how 1 bullet went through like 8 peoples heads3 the baths in wax huh 4 the magic tapistry that foretold who was to be assasinated5 you had me kill my own father wow its amazing that your own dad kept his silence about it and accepted his own death6 all of your names came up well isnt this a surprise7 the rat bombs animal crueltythis was just an all out piece of crap the plot was obvious and the worst scene in the film had to be when they were chasing the limo and they flipped the car over it,fantasy
i hated everything about this horrible film i found it to be terrible muddled annoying and dumb it was even worse than 300 and the spirit i wasnt surprised to discover that this movie was directed by the same guy who made night watch and day watch both horrible and poorly made films with an incoherent plot is even worse than those films the visuals are ugly the plot and the scenes are absolutely muddled and dumb even the visual effects are terrible and poorly madewhy morgan freeman accepted to work in this ugly mess everything about this film is terrible must be one the worst movies ever made it is crummy boring and incredibly stupid 1010,fantasy
i think the reason i dont like action movies very much is because they tend to be just dramas in disguise and is nothing different its hard for me to remember an action movie that actually had actionsuch as in aliens and kill billand wasnt just a lifetime tv drama about how the main character has family problems and he tries to fix them    oh and then his car blows up or in this case he has family problems he gets in a gun fight and he tries to fix his family problems againits the biggest clich in the book a son tries to elevate to the level of his godlikeinsert one of the following warriorassassinninjaetcfather that died before he was born thats how starts out with the oldest clich known to man and from that point on it only delve deeper into clich after clich im not even going to go into how unoriginal this movie is it would take me pages and even the dumbest person out there can sit there and realize they saw the exact same plot line in star wars and a hundred other movies as well in my theater at the point of the plot twist i had to say under my breath luke i am your father     it got more laughs from my row than any of the intentional humor in this moviethe rest plot is more ridicules than ripoff i think when the writer realized how unoriginal his script was he had to think of the lamest original idea he could randomly selecting a name from a loom and killing the person and we call old horror movies cheesy yet call this completely reasonable as far as the characters go every one of them is a clich morgan freeman is the clich old man who makes ordersalso seen in every action movie ever conceived angelina jolie plays the mysterious vixen with no more personality than a dying treealso seen in close to every action movie ever made james mcavoy plays the unsuspecting looseralso seen in every action movie since the 70s so the characters and plot are worthless and boring how about the action itself the gunfights were the sole thing this movie did right well that is until you get to the clich slowmotion head shots that are no more graphic than images of someone throwing up red koolaid it seems that any action movie that has come out after the matrix uses slowmotion kills anymore and the style is just as bland as it has ever been also this is not a gory action movie at all if you want a graphic action movie go watch predator or the unrated version of death sentence but sadly i cant even complement on being graphic because though there is a decent amount of blood on the floor how it gets there is pg or pg13 ratedin the end is just as boring as every other boring action movie i give it some credit for trying to be a little differentat least its not another movie about terrorists again but it fails in everything it tries it fails at being thrilling it fails at getting the manlyman message across about how men are boring like the main character was before he became a clich    err before he became an assassinoh the irony its more boring than it says the people watching it are210,fantasy
with one or two decent scenes of action until it tips the action maybe a few steps over the edge of acceptable thats what you get in this moviei went to see this on a free ticket thingy with one of my best mates on a wet and windy day thing was i honestly had no idea what to expect thats really my own fault but hey free tickets cant complain right ok the story is this and try not to laugh as you read on james mcavoy plays big time loser wesley gibson an office worker with a heart condition stressed being cheated on by his best mate sleeping with his girlfriend and generally just being a nobody enter anorexic angelina jolie fox with awful tattoos up and down her body she tells wesley that his father was assassinated on a roof top and that he was apart of a secret fraternity of assassins that had been around for 1000 years calledwait for it the fraternity  how original wesley is taken to this fraternity where he discovers his true identity and his destiny to be a big time assassinnow this is the best part morgan freeman plays sloan aka morpheus mk ii and takes wesley under his guidance where he is beaten black and blue stabbed to hell with butchers knives and undertaken on many more obscene torture sessions to become the best assassin on the planet he obtains his targets by a pile of grannys knitting aka a gigantic loom thread where there are binary codes hidden in the stitching binary code in stitchingyesbinary hidden in stringokay  so thats all laughable  it gets worse thoughfrom the offset of this films opening scene it just reminded me of the matrix straight out nothing else not but a poor mans matrix that is all this film is poor mans matrix youll be kidding yourself if you actually enjoy any segment of this film as its mostly loaded with yetmoreslowmoscene moments which look poorly made and god damn cheesy i wont spoil the party piece thoughactually i will its when morgan freeman says mother fker right at the end of this 2 hour nonsense thats really the only reason why i was generous giving this 4 stars out of 10 i have to give the film some credit though it does have one or two good scenes but lets be honest curving bullets binary codes hidden in loom threads a predictable plot and ridiculous long shots where bullets seem to deny the barriers of gravity going through donut hoops windows energy drinks and finally hitting someone through the head on a 10 storey building  isnt my idea of a great action movie i cant honestly remember a great action film i have seen in the last year apart from die hard 4save time by avoiding this film at all costs just beware that the 75 out of 10 is really misleading actually read some of the comments before you go venturing off into the wilderness,fantasy
in the summer action movie sweepstakes is the prize winner based on a sixissue comic series by mark millar and jg jones provides the appropriate thrills action and engagement needed for a strong summer movie extravaganzafocuses on wesley gibson james mcavoy a nobody in a minor deadend job with an overbearing boss and a best friend who is getting horizontal with wesleys girlfriend during lunch breaks however when picking up a prescription one day wesley is greeted by fox angelina jolie who informs him he is the son of a great assassin who was just murdered by another assassin and is now the killers target she takes him on a whirlwind chase and then introduces him to sloan morgan freeman the head of the fraternity an order of assassins a thousand years old sloan informs wesley that he has the same potential to be a superb assassin as his father and thus leads to wesley standing up to his boss his girlfriend his friend and beginning his training to become a member of the fraternityexudes much of the same energy as the matrix as well as sharing a similar visual flair without necessarily ripping off the former film when the action sequences kick in they are a rather spectacular sight to behold featuring a great deal of stylization and visual acrobatics that astonish supremely yes the logic behind many moments in is completely nonexistent featuring such elements as curving bullets and killers so trained that they can manage to shoot a weapon with the exact trajectory to stop another oncoming bullet but that doesnt really matter grabs you when necessary and you just come along for the ride the film is also helped along by some very strong visual effects that blend rather seamlessly with the surrounding liveaction materialmuch like the early summer success iron man also understands that to really get into a story we have to be involved in the characters and with our entry point is wesley he starts out as a character almost all of us can identify with the downtrodden cog in the machine coasting through his days with a feeling of inevitability and hopelessness by letting us feel sympathy for wesley we have a rooting interest in what happens later and therefore are involved in the films actionjames mcavoy gives us a vulnerable character in the form of wesley at the beginning of who then transforms into an assassin but we never lose our identification with him angelina jolie doesnt have a whole lot of dialogue but makes an impression as fox nonetheless morgan freeman fills his character with a mixture of both authority and menace proving once again what a masterful actor he isis nothing tremendous on the plot front it doesnt offer the audience anything too deep but that is not necessary it is a summer thrill ride and at that it succeeds exceptionally,fantasy
as far as action movies go this one was entertaining if a little insane definitely not short on the prerequisite action set pieces and certainly overflowing with cg effects it is two hours through which you can and probably should just turn your brain off and allow to flow over you having seen the trailer with the beginnings of the car chase i was quite looking forward to seeing this film and as has been happening rather a lot recently i must say i was once again disappointed at having wasted my time and money at the cinema this film takes itself far too seriously except for angelina jolie who seems to be having quite a laugh probably at my expense because i paid to see it some of the action set pieces will leave you in bemused bewilderment how does running headon into another car allow you to leap over the car beside you surely our hero should have just been pulverised there and then job done but no on it goes with ever more ludicrous feats including but not limited to shooting bullets at each other and of course the curving of bullets surely this movie could not have been made if not for bullet time if the film had been a little less serious and some better one liners inserted then it could have been far more entertaining but this was never destined to be anything more than a summer hollywood blockbuster and as such is sorely lacking in anything besides a far too large budget unless action is all you crave save your money and wait to rent it on dvd if you must maybe its better once youve had a bit to drink,fantasy
this is the most appalling film i have ever seen how did so much money and basically decent talent go into making such a gratuitously violent bloody pointless stupid evil piece of junk i went along to a preview with a critic friend who also hated it and wasnt aware until the end credits that it was based on a comic book which is not surprising given the ridiculous storyline and characters besides a huge number of men or should i say targets there are exactly three female characters in this film one is the amusingly fat office manager who bedevils the hero one is his cheating girlfriend and one is the skeletal and extremely weird angelina jolie on the plus side only one of them shoots 850000 bullets into people and bonds with the hero over his newfound ability to kill strangers guess which i dont have a problem with violent films but this was just so overthetop and pointless and not in an interesting way it made me depressed to be human imagine if this were the sole surviving artifact of our civilization terence stamp i am disappointed in you,fantasy
some slight spoilers i just saw an advance screening of this movie this afternoon it was fantastic other reviewers have compared to the matrix  i can see where this comparison comes from but is a far far better movie  with actual intelligence and not a small amount of humour as well as some really excellent action sequencesjames mcavoy presents an admirable main character whose initial situation will be familiar to anyone who has ever held a dull office job morgan freeman fulfilled all expectations as the older mentortype character the rest of the fraternity were excellently portrayed angelina jolie was a surprise  i had expected that she might be the films weak point but in fact she did an excellent job portraying foxand well there are the rats and the peanut butter also did anyone else recognise the exterminator the russian character as anton from night watch and day watch summing up excellent ten stars in fact i wish i could score it higher than ten as i think it deserves more timur bekmambetov is a director to watch if he can produce more movies like this hell go far,fantasy
i was glad that i did not spend a dime to watch this movie a friend of mine treated me to cinema what a terribly awful movie horribly nonsense background there are only two good things about this movie the cool red dodge viper that jolie drives and the spectacular scene of the train collapsing on the rail bridge over a huge cliff beneath the icy mountain other than that totally rubbishthis movie made spiderman or superman or even hancock look like star movies because not only they deliver somewhat more realistic world and realistic superhero abilities but also because these other movies outshine in every imaginable way at least spiderman superman and hancock still obey law of physics and gravity and no they cant mindcontrol movement of bullets and they got hurt too and did not get heal fast unlike the magic healing wax that instantly out of nowhere could cure the hero in a blink of eyes in this moviewell enough said why waste my energy on writing more indepth review only one advise for you who havent watched this movie  avoid it it would upset you rather than entertain you,fantasy
what did you do today just watching a movie going to high school or working at mcdonalds or a generic version of office space are you an impossibly pathetic character whose moviepretty girlfriend accepts your crappy apartment by the train tracks yet hates you enough to constantly cheat with one of your coworkers are you buying condoms for the best chum at work you know is doing your girlfriend well dont worry because all the skills of an assassin are biologically determined a few punches in the face and some exercise and you will be james bond perfect because your absentee father was and we all know dna is much more important than practice or disciplinethis movie gets all of its charm from the conceit that we know it is all part of the matrix era bullet time slickness of action and the understanding that it all comes from a comic book anyway so if you have to pick someone up all you have to do is skid sideways right into the person at high speed with the door open and scoop em up no danger of breaking his legs at all and there can never be too many times two evenly matched assassins demonstrate the fact by their bullets crashing into each other harmlessly in mid flightangelina jolie has said that sure she is carrying guns in this movie but she condones what happens to the characters so she could get behind the movie however it resolves though most of the movie is a losers fantasy of having an exciting life that might very well suit the video game audience under 25 years old but if you cant get past the improbable efficiency of the team and the improbable stupidity of the protagonist from scene to scene the big twist that pats itself on the head for its brilliance will seem to belong in another movie had the action not been so cartoonish maybe we could believe what it purports to say it still exists in a vacuumsealed circle of geekhood one expects from agent cody banks the only difference is that he is twentysomething,fantasy
there is nothing i despise more than how popular culture has redefined cool in days not so long ago cool meant an absence of heat if something was cool it was tepid mild even subdued now cool in movies is when you kill somebody and behave indifferently to your action a cool character blows a hundred people away but acts if he just stepped out for a smoke i resent the crushing of human emotions im peeved at a culture that finds emotional indifference attractive i like cinematic killing as much as if not more than the next guy but the films i love focus on emotions associated with killing if they dont focus on the emotions of killing or raping they dont depict emotionless killers as cool one example of the former is chow yun fatts hitman character in john woos the killer he is struggling with the moral decisions of his profession he gets involved with the nightclub singer because he feels guilt for having blinded her his internal struggle is the key to the films emotional power i preface my review of with the above rant because annoyed me it is a slick expensive disposable action movie that equates killing and destruction with cool i know its just a movie but so what its an empty movie and id like it more if it didnt pretend that human emotions dont exist the special effects are impressive they should be for the budget and the performances are ok but the climax is rubbish and the attempt at being meaningful is a dead loss because weve spent ninety minutes with character who are little more than stick figures with pistols ultimately this film is boring and i cant help thinking that gamers whod probably prefer an interactive experience anyway will have seen it all before,fantasy
the movie starts very promising kind of reminding me of fight club when a man does a jump of about 40 meters between two large buildings after breaking through glass headfirst without a scratch some minutes later you start wondering if this might be a matrix sequel cool so far but as the story unfolds you recognize that it has a lot of holes in it everything concerning the story is shallow and very on the surface the main characters remain completely undeveloped freeman and jolie might have done well if the lousy script would have allowed them took let the members of the assassin fraternity have better reactions and visual capabilities than other people but they are humans after all arent they making them defy the laws of nature gravity shooting in angles etc makes them superhuman and this fills the movie with incredible computer aided stunt scenes which i personally found actually boring during the movie because its all too perfect and clean this could be a fine movie if it would tell a story and not be all about the action thats what made matrix great it has the action and the storyline,fantasy
a frustrated office worker learns that he is the son of a professional assassin and that he shares his fathers superhuman killing abilitieszero expectations very boring day and the only intention to see angelina jolie thing is the movie starting and i sat back ready to waste an hour and a half then i receive much more than i had expected the movie starts great we understand whats going on and what is happening to each character movie progresses we have some intellectual ideas tagged along with kickass action sequences movie is close to end we have a bit of a twist some deaths and the amazing ending scene the credits roll me and friend sit aweinspired by a great movie which brought us both to surprise sadly people dont get it they thought the movie was pointless poorly done and its main priority was to put some action sequences in and cut it clean fortunately these people are all wrong and thank god for that ive never read the comic book series in fact im not much of a comic book fan and some people lost its point or as read up the film is actually inspired by the comic book series maybe the reviewers expected an exact decoy of the comics but instead they missed the definition of inspired and went on to bash on another reason the reviews bashed on it is because of its ideas we have bending bullets waking up in ice and a new language hidden in thread while some may sound silly leading me to the flaws they are actually all inspired by movies like matrix or fight club i think people missed the point or not watched with an open mind because the ideas werent all that bad in fact they were actually kind of understanding and a bit intelligent otherwise and nevertheless i recommend this film its isnt bad acting story or reason its actually quite a good unique film even if you arent an action junkie like me you should check it out might have some surprises around the corner 810,fantasy

can you combine matrix elektra and equilibrium into a completely pointless exercise that looks good but makes no sense that was the question asked by some money makers to the director of the movie yes siree i canthe film starts with a matrix like scene continues with the average man learning he is extraordinary then switches to the group of highly trained assassins that only take good missions assigned to them by fate and continues to ridiculous gun scenes one in which a bullet has a circular trajectory and kills everyone including the shooter and its all in the wrists ladies and gentlemenbottom line stay away from this simulacrum of a movie its nothing but peanut butter and explosive,fantasy
like something you would get if you removed half of tarantinos brain and told him to do a remake of rocky an insult to whatever genre it contends it is in angelina jolie and morgan freeman put in their two weeks and produced clichs the thirteen year olds would consider profoundthe plot was derivative at best  flat out plagiaristic for the most part and the meek office boy eventually stands up to his horrid boss and says shut the  up who woulda thunk like finding tires on an automobilelots of borrowed special effects that will make you long for radio  unless you are thirteen in which case you will think them way cool check out rocky kill bill karate kid and you will see where this was stolen from  and this is like stealing three great sculptures welding them together and calling it original artlots of stylistic blood  yippee,fantasy
im not surprised that some of the ratings here are low but i am surprised by their reasons one user stated this movie was not an actionthriller but a comedygore movie are you kidding me i think this user must have been living under a rock for the last few years ive seen more gore in an episode of csi than in this entire movie anyway im giving 10 stars this was too much fun the movie is a little predictable but who cares the action is over the top and fantasy like this was done on purpose and in the middle of an action scene i found myself laughing at a one liner i have never been a fan on angelina jolie but she does provide some of the comic relief which made her fun to watch i have been a fan of james mcavoy for years the real reason i to see this movie now his character is a clich but again who cares you laugh at him for the first half of the movie and hope youre not much like him as you probably know this is not a straight to the oscars type of movie it will make you say wow followed by a good laugh when it was over the entire theater applauded and i can bet a lot of those people will go back to see it again im one of them,fantasy
for shear entertainment value this is one of the best movies of the summer of 2008 over the top action sequences reminiscent of the matrix will blow you away with their creativity and tongueincheek excess it is visually rich with the visceral grit of fight club you have not seen anything quite like this before theres plenty of originality here this is a film im looking forward to watching many more times once it comes out on dvd in fact i may make this my first bluray disk this is a way better movie than batman the dark knightone of the most overrated films of all time i would gladly pay full price to see this movie again before id waste my time watching batman again for free,fantasy
i have to say i love these sort of movies and after seeing the trailer couldnt wait to see this movie i thought the movie had a definite tone of fight club in it which i didnt mind one bit as its my fave movie ever angelina jolie just exudes screen presence and she even admitted she removed lines as she thought the character should shut up and not say much how many actors would do that mccavoy was really good in his role evolving from a geek to a bad ass assassin freeman is his usual brilliant self and delivers a killer line near the end the movie doesnt let you come up for air and had me holding my breath at the sheer spectacle of the special effects yes the storyline and action is ott thats the point of the story we lead sad depressing boring lives most of the time and we would kill for a chance to do something amazing anyone who likes over thought over talked movies probs should give this a miss it is a proper popcorn movie which  if you are like me will want to see it all over again loved it 100 cant wait for dvd,fantasy
a guy near the bottom of the well of his life is offered a new life a life totally different from the one he is living now the life of an assassinwhen i saw the trailers for this film i was thinking it was going to be a brainless action film with lots of collateral damage a flimsy story and some nice looking scenery but overall a good sense of amusement when the film started that thought was proved rather quickly i had been wrong in one point though the amusement factor that last one was quickly broken when scene after scene went over the top and a lot of scenes did that so far that every sense of reality and with that tension was brokento me it felt like the film tried for too much at once and eventually toppled itself over while it could have been a lot better i didnt feel entirely cheated out of my entrance money but i did feel a little sting that usually indicates that5 out of 10 bullets fired at a moving target,fantasy
thanks to the numerous reviews here i knew what i had to expect and loved it for what it wasthis truly is one dumb action flick disregarding physics logic but its brilliant entertainment with lots of fun nice footage and a fitting soundtrack the actors do their job well what else did you expect the setting is interesting and its got some nicely balanced gems for everyone cars stunts martial arts gore nice looking guys and a goddess the story has enough twists and mystique to keep you amused well what should i say about the montage this is a weak spot but being a southpark fan im somewhat immune having their brilliant song in my head on occasions like that if youre narrowminded youre gonna have a bad time if youre up for some fun and you are willing to blow your brains out with a movie  hit this one,fantasy
plot or lack there of a jerky mean spirited loser whom we are meant to embrace as an everyman protagonist mcavoy is plucked out of his unhappy depressing life which includes a crappy job with an annoying boss a bitchy unfaithful girlfriend who cheats on him  with his knowledge  with his douche bag best friend by the mysterious freeman who reveals that mcavoys character is the son of a highly skilled practically superhuman assassin for his fraternity of superhuman assassins who base their kills on mystical messages of sorts from a loom trained make that repeatedly beaten up by jolie but there is more to it than meets the eye or noti admit to having not read the original comic book that this was based off of so i can only judge the film for what it is  action trash and not particularly good action trash at that besides the over the top absurdity the soulless clichs the plot holes and ridiculous action scenes theres not one single likable character in all this mess as i stated before the main character played james mcavoy is a mean spirited jerk from the get go and by the end of the film he is no better personality wise than he was before yes it is established that hes had a crappy life but that alone does not redeem his inherently unsympathetic behavior throughout the film even antiheroes need to be vaguely likable in some way and mcavoys wesley simply fails at that angelina jolie sleepwalks through her role as the sexy assassin who takes mcavoy under her wing and both she and morgan freeman deserve better than this how freeman even allowed himself to get involved with this nonsense is a mystery good thing he was also in the dark knight around the same timeto call the film style over substance would be an insult since the style is so poor it doesnt begin to hide the lack of substance youd be better off watching lethal weapon or 48 hours,fantasy
i think this is one of those films that weve all seen in many other films as anyone has most likely read it contains elements of many popular movies like the matrix fight club v for vendetta and in my opinion fails at bringing those togetherim sure that upon the reading of the script it seemed that it would be a great film with some action some personal growth of the protagonist and one great dilemma to overcome but in reality the growth was too sudden with no real reward and no reason to do soi think that in most cases a film can be summed up in the first ten minutes that it will be worth sitting through and quite soon in the film i had very little reason to believe in the character wesley gibson james mcavoy just didnt seem to fit into the character at all his office working life cheating girlfriend and panic attacks just werent there for me and if were supposed to believe in our character to the end and dont the film has failedthe biggest shock to me was morgan freeman here is an actor that has the wise grandfather approach that we all look up to for a solid and consistent character performance and he does away with that near the end when we hear him say fk to me this is a sign that the film has done nothing but pull your head out of your huge bag of popcorn wondering if the film is over but it wasntinstead it ends with the shameful surprise ending of the falling of the fourth wall and ask you why you wasted your time with this movie,fantasy
the anxious clumsy and abused office clerk wesley allan gibson james mcavoy has a hell and boring routine life his obese boss humiliates him all the time and his girlfriend betrays him with his colleague and best friend during working period when he meets the sexy fox angeline jolie wesley is informed that his father was a professional killer that belonged to an ancient organization called fraternity and killed by the skilled and powerful cross thomas kretschmann a hitman that has betrayed the fraternity wesley learns that his anxiety actually is a manifestation of his latent abilities and he joins the society under the command of sloan morgan freeman trained by fox he changes his personality and attitude being prepared to face the dangerous cross and find a hidden secretuses the storyline of la femme nikita blended with lots of gore revenge and special effects  la equilibrium the story has a good cast with names like terence stamp morgan freeman and angelina jolie a very highbudget and is full of action viewers that like blockbuster movies probably may like this movie much more than i did i still prefer movies based on intelligent screenplays and acting rather than in explosions and special effects my vote is sixtitle brazil o procurado the,fantasy
as a big fan of the matrix i was entertained by this movie during the first hour except that sometimes dialog devolved into bleep bleepin bleep that was so bleep are you bleeping me i think the script could have used some serious editing so that actual information could have been conveyed in the dialog instead of just how amazing pod the character was all the timewhen the plot twist occurred think star wars the movie actually expected me to go back and revise everything i had seen including bullets running into each other which would have otherwise been fatali was shooting at you to help you not kill you yeah right my suspension of disbelief was over at that point then with a more critical eye i looked at all the other ridiculous plot elements and realized i had pretty much wasted all of my time watching this thingi noticed that a lot of people who liked the movie also read the graphic novel that probably makes the movie a lot more palatable and fills in blanks so that what is seen is not nonsensefor those of us unfamiliar with the graphic novel the movie turned on that one plot twist in a very disappointing fashion im sorry but rather than believe the movie im believing my lying eyesso my final comment would be bleep bleepin bleep that was so bleep are you bleeping me,fantasy
hot chick guns and a bad message  zero another review compared this to the matrix and that couldnt be further from the case on every level i love a great action movie and this is not that the last monologue of the movie actually made me feel sick to my stomach because it drives home how intentionally this movie poses violence as a solution to disempowerment not exactly a message we need to hear in this day and age it probably delivers for the fast and the furious audience but if youre looking for quality entertainment id recommend looking elsewhere what the f have i done lately see this movieand it was a big disappointment,fantasy
the steep competition in the realm of summer action romps more often than not creates the necessity for any new efforts to make an instant attempt to stand out as something new and innovative while still conforming to the tried and true conventions making such films so shamelessly enjoyable one would be hard pressed to find a more vivid example than appearing almost gimmicky in its flaunting of its standout selling points bullet bending corporate satire morgan freeman and angelina jolie crafting the image of one of the summers most fresh bouts of carnage and while does not disappoint on the exhilaration front it falls considerably short of the astonishing action epic it seemingly wants to be despite being marketed as a fresh foray into the world of action mayhem takes very direct influences from numerous sources making many of its supposed innovations seem worn out and overly familiar apart from director timur bekmambetovs similarly hyperkinetic nightwatch series the film plunders from works as diverse as fight clubs satirical critique of the soulless corporate world complete with a nihilistic norton style voiceover to the matrixs immersion into a new world jolie and freemans characters scream parallels to trinity and morpheus and hyperstylized adrenaline pumping action sequences however where the winning combination should have clicked and resulted in one of the years most flat out exhilarating action thrillers instead it fizzles its unoriginal solemnity coming across as almost pretentious and far in intent from the big loud and very silly action movie its gleefully over the top action and laughably stilted script make it fated to remain the main criticism of lies in its excesses while all the elements on display appeared favourable all are pushed too far over the top as if attempting to up the ante on all similar action films while descending disappointingly into mediocrity as a result the screenplay delves into a slew of enormously familiar situations as if attempting to identify and exemplify every existing action movie clich from the initial training montages to the why do we kill assassin soul searching to double crosses ethical responsibility parental fixation and countless others but where this peppering of familiarity could have made for a bombastically enjoyable time the film is treated with such hushed reverence and solemnity that all the normally excusable clich and lapses in credibility become all the more glaringly frustrating what sorely lacks is the sense of lighthearted fun which would help its selling point of eyepopping action sequences fly instead of coming across as pent up and contrived plot frustrations aside there can remain no doubt thats primary selling point remained the gleefully overblown shootouts chases and bone crunching fights and here the film flexes its cinematic muscles more confidently providing many of the more memorable action setpieces in recent cinema the car chases and final shootout are highlights from the first moments of the initial shootout it becomes clear that not only has realism left the building but taken a running dash through the top floor windows of it foreshadowing the films tendency to careen over the top in almost every possible fashion to thrilling but often chaotically overwhelming effect however even those normally sated by flashy gunplay and lots of it may find themselves frowning in disbelief at many of the films more ambiguous creative choices the recurring theme of the emasculated man finding himself through violence veers into uncertain ethical territory even for an unabashed action film and the numerous staggering gaps in logic the exploding rats were just too much gargantuan plot holes and underdeveloped concepts a bit of exposition on the assassin cults mystical abilities especially the much hyped curving bullets would have done wonders strain credibility several shades too far even where next to none was expected in the first place all the attitude on display makes the film appear to be trying slightly too hard to be edgy and rebellious but its lack of originality or confident script make it seem more petulant than daring the genius unorthodox casting of james mcavoy proves the spark of life which keeps the film afloat his substantial charisma perfect comic delivery and entirely credible shift from timid corporate drone to hardboiled action hero making for a supremely engaging lead unfortunately the same cannot be said for the absurdly capable supporting cast who are almost entirely wasted in paper thin archetypes their mere presences substituting for credible characters or performances nowhere is this more clear than in the case of angelina jolie given almost nothing to do but near wordlessly discharge a series of firearms or flaunt her tattooed backside when called upon with nothing more complicated to work with morgan freeman is similarly firmly on autopilot in the dignified mentor role he could essay in his sleep and while a couple of unexpected character moments prove amusing ultimately his presence is nowhere near as much of a boon as it should be terrence stamp shows potential as a grave ammunition manufacturer with a mysterious backstory but his character is critically deprived of screen time giving him little chance to contribute anything in the way of performance such is also the case for thomas kretschmann a strong presence as a vague antagonist figure but given so little to do his talents are almost entirely wastedwhile may frequently dazzle its flashy visuals and thrilling action cannot mask the ultimate shoddiness underneath the senseless fun of the action sequences being often dampened by the implausibly imbalanced storyline and downright poor script while those in search of lots of bullets flying about and little else in the way of complexity may find themselves suitably entertained considering the competition in the action film market and the vast potential the film had to offer ultimately leaves one wanting 610,fantasy
i am a movie lover i watch any genre of movies including drama comedy romance thriller horror action adventure fantasy scifi documentary and indie movies i watch at least 12 movies per week of course that includes most latest titles out there right nowanyways i dont really want to describe in detail about the story or anything  all i wanna say is that its definitely one of the best movies ive watched in a very long time the last movie i thought was really great was august rush being a fan of fight club the matrix and sin city  is a mixture of these three great movies and hits as hard as these if not morethe movie is thrilling actionpacked great cinematography highly interesting and unpredictable story with many twists great acting strong message in the end inspiring  somebody said its like the hybrid of fight club and the matrix  i totally agree it is definitely a classic but unique in its own wayi really recommend anyone to check out this movie maybe not kids since its rated r and they probably wont understand the story anyway but its definitely one amazing movie get out of your house and watch it now ps i never thought angelina was hot before  but after  i want her  she is freakin hot,fantasy
is pretty much another sort of mindless action film i did enjoy it though but it is not what i would call great cinema in terms of execution it is a lot like the matrix the special effects and cinematography are well done the weapons are funny the action sequences though well executed are repetitive and ridiculously absurd as they stretch the film too far yes both in terms of plot line and duration but of course i wasnt expecting some meaningful cinema just pure entertainment and to enjoy this one has to suspend reality the soundtrack is pretty cool james mcavoy does a decent job of carrying the film a sizzling angelina jolie makes the best of what shes given its nice to see morgan freeman do something different for a long time he hasnt and is this the first movie where one hears him say the f word the story is a bit predictable but i liked the idea of using a beloved one as a weapon against the target overall its a good enough popcorn flick with loads of action,fantasy
off the chain look for an unexpected twist at the end i didnt quite understand it but was very good movie watching grab that bag of popcorn and soda in the other hand and enjoy if you have been waiting for angelina jolie to come out with a new action packed movie this is i was surprised by the role that morgan freeman chose but it suits him an action picture that shows ingenuity in inventing new ways to attack defend ambush and annihilate slams the pedal to the metal and never slows down james mcavoy gets the opportunity to avenge on his tormentors and enter a fantasy world where he can realize his hidden powers as a skilled assassin,fantasy
i tend to give great visual movies a look even if there is a 5050 chance the film might be rubbish as the brits say sometimes i am delighted to find a stylish and wellmade film or one that is goofy but harmless and fun other times as in this instance i find just one thing garbage as we americans saythis is pure garbage sad to say despite the stylish action scenes which are somewhat of a ripoff from the matrix movies where the filmmakers are obsessed over showing slowmotion shots of bullets flying through the air and then smashing into someones forehead hey a couple of times is fine but nonstop this is nonstop violence which tends to get boring fast especially when its combined with profane unlikable charactersi swear the lead guy played by james mcavoy did nothing but scream for at least 10 straight minutes early on he and this film are really abrasive this isnt a good guy in the bunch here at least give us someone to root for not a bunch of sleazebags i didnt even finish the film why waste the whole nightall the style in the world is not going to make up for a mess like this im glad to see most reviewers here sharing that opinion,fantasy
this film has got it all it starts with the braindead script of course borrowed from a comicbook practically nobody has ever heard of then you go all the way to russia to hire a commercials director who thinks empty visuals somehow amounts to directing and who would not know how to tell a story visually if his life depended on it as if there werent plenty of those stateside then you hire a star with a spotty commercial track record did you know angelina jolie has been lining up the boxoffice bomb regularly throughout her career  sky captain anyone who has given up on even trying to act and partner her up with the latest british discovery who turns out to be a poor actor with no discernible charisma ala colin farrell but even blanderstir the pot add a humongous ad campaign to fool as many people as possible into seeing this turkey on opening day and youve gotthink about the great movie that could have been made with all that money,fantasy
i have to admit that i had low expectations to begin with just because from the trailer alone we saw a reluctant main hero who was recruited to join a special elite group which is pretty obvious what type of movie it was going to be especially with the over the top special effects but seeing that there hasnt been a good all action gun war in a long time ive decided to watch it anyways the storyline as i assume it to be was exactly as expected which in some cases i found the secondary character to be more interesting then main one the action scenes would have been much more greater if they didnt show all of them in the trailers so going to see this movie would be even more of a let down if youve seen them already i think it would have been more interesting to see if the story line had the characters revolved around the special bullets and how it would effecting them in one way or another instead if your looking for more substance and a different look in the art of gun fighting i recommend watching equilibrium but i admit the pacing will be a little bit more slower then but much more gratifying,fantasy
maybe wasnt as successful as  i thought  it should be when it was released back in 2008 because these sorts of semi superhero movies were only just coming into fashion maybe its because it was based on a comic book that wasnt that wellknown and the films producers annoyed the diehard fan by changing various elements or maybe its because its got a pretty uninspired title which doesnt really tell you what the film is about it could just be someone posting something on craigs list either way i loved it then and im pleased to say that it stands up to this dayits about a young man wesley james mcavoy before he really hit the big time in hollywood playing a young man who doesnt know his place in life he medicates himself daily while working in a dead end job dont we all and is routinely victimised by his boss while his girlfriend is having an affair with his best mate however his life takes a slightly more wild turn when a femme fatale known as fox angelia jolie inducts him into a super secret society of assassins known as the fraternity led by sloan morgan freeman and together theyll well youll have to see but theres naturally various bad guys to kill and noble causes to fighti suppose the plot isnt that radical to attract much attention however it has all the look and feel of a good comic book you could ever want now i call that a plus whereas i think a lot of people saw it as a drawback largely because these assassins are pretty damn amazing  their main special ability being the knack of bending bullets so they can bend the missiles around corners yes its a little farfetched but this is a comic book movie and if you can get over this then i think youll have a really good timeif youre expecting something uber serious and gritty then look away now there are more than a few times where the film does things simply for laughs and to not just bend bullets but also the movies reality it never really takes itself that seriously and so is a lot more fun and popcornworthy than some type of darker modern action movie like daniel craigs bond franchise or the bourne moviesyes theres nothing that new here but the fact that its a great action movie with alist stars and set pieces that make the most of the unique fighting premise that exists in this movie world should be enough to give it at least a cult following and stop it fading into complete obscurity,fantasy
for those that love the matrix and john wick movies this was 5 years before wick and several of wicks moves were similar intop actors and jolie liked the story and plot twist and wish they had done a follow updont try to apply logic just go along for the ride and you wont be disappointed,fantasy
if it start giving away production to a people like bekmambetov as you can guess i am from russia we had a lot of hype about this film here i was watching it on a release date painfully surprised by the ticket price 2 dollars higher then normal now what i am going to tell you  first 10 minutes of the movie are god dammed promising the whole scene is well filmed and the effects are right where they should be problem is after that movie just goes down all the way you can imagine  in the end its you actually dont know what to do  laugh at the incredibly weak plot full of clichs and poorly connected threads or cry because you know it was a lot of money invested in this piece of junk and still it failedif you are a fan of special effects  then you might want to see this in a cinema but if you want some more from a movie  do yourself a favor wait for a dvd release or dont wait and simply skip this one,fantasy
begins with a shootout between two professional assassins in a highrise office building one off the assassins jumps to the rooftop of the other building where he murders all the people who are trying to kill him however when he jumps hes able to fly across horizontally without falling to the ground hes also able to control the bullets he fires from his gun making them bend around potential victims and then striking the targets he seeks all this comic book nonsense wouldnt be so offensive except for the fact that the director enjoys reveling in the violence throughout the film bullets fly in slow motion and always seems to strike their victims in the center of the head with gobs of blood oozing all over the place brian mcavoy plays wesley gibson an office worker hooked on antianxiety medication hes a wuss surrounded by his unlikeable boss an obese woman who berates him all the time his best friend humiliates him by having sex with his girlfriend in front of him on multiple occasions gibson is recruited by a 1000year old secret society of assassins called the fraternity led by sloan played by morgan freeman who informs him that one of their renegade members cross has murdered one of their best members who just happens to be gibsons father who he never knew apparently the fraternity wants to train the hopeless gibson because they feel being an assassin is in his blood he goes through a very longwinded training period where various members of the group including fox played by angelina jolie toughen him up by punching stabbing and shooting him all over his body gibson must be subjected to numerous rounds of torture until he becomes egoless and finally adopts the steellike mindset of the professional assassin the fraternity is not without its new age pretensions for every time they beat gibson to a pulp during their training session they then put him in a bath place some kind of clay all over his body including his face and fill him with vodka miraculously the bath and the vodka do the trick and hes up and about to face another round of beatings until hes ready to go forth and battle cross meanwhile sloan reveals to gibson how members are given their assignments they work in some sort of textile factory where a loom weaves a tapestry which produces messages with some kind of secret code discernible within the fabric sloan seems to be the only one who knows how to decipher the messages and hence doles out the assignments gibson along with fox end up shooting some guy in an office building while theyre running from one subway train to another on an elevated trackthings get worse when gibson finally is able to track down cross and kills him but not before finding out that cross was actually his dad and the fraternity had doublecrossed him in the laughable finale gibson drives a garbage truck full of rats armed with miniature time bombs and dumps them inside some european castle where the fraternity are all ensconced the rats explode and most of the assassins are killed sloan somehow escapes but gibson dupes him we never find out how by planting a double in his old office cubiclejust about like every other death in this film sloan takes a bullet in the forehead the last shot in the film is gibson holding his machine gun cursing all his opponents and basically bragging what a macho guy he is is basically trash for mindless 14yearolds the director is from russia and famous for vampire films this would have been a much better film if he threw a few vampires into the mix morgan freeman and angelina jolie merely show up to cash their paychecks not only does promote violence it revels in it in the perverted moral universe of a winner is defined as the last thug left standing hopefully you wont pay 12 to see this trash when it comes to cable just flick your remote to the next channel,fantasy
after mama mia seeing was a sort of antidote from over the top confectionery frolics to some thriller that was trying for a new twist a sort of xmen with smaller mutations appeared bullets that curve bullets hit one another heart rates at 400 per minute in order to achieve this effect first their was the cod history lesson about assassins who for a thousand years have executed people to some rather dodgy moral code the film opens with a spectacular shootout cut to about james mcavoy an office worker whose life is falling apart under a tyrannical boss and feeling sorry for himself his life is turned around when angelina jolie invites him to join the assassins and reveals his special powers example 400 heart beat etc jolie having made the big time has finally returned to acting like big star and is the best thing on th film despite having not much to do a big chase sequence follows with some amazing train special effects except thats what we expect from films these days much of this is scriptbynumbers but there are a couple of nice twists which make this worth seeing there is the whole thing about the weavers and the code for the killing but i couldnt see all the crossstitching that they could see in order to kill people,fantasy
two scenes in this movie are worth watching 1 a car chase early in the film and 2 a pyrotechnicfilled montage towards the very end everything else in between has a phonedin feel to it from mcavoys embarrassingly bad american accent to the vain attempt at creating plot complexity by adding more meaningless twists the plot arc of the movie is clear early on and all the added detail just serves to clutter up the story jolie as much as she can be a joy to watch has to suffer through ridiculously terrible writing her childhood story is one of the worstwritten scenes of the past five years all the move has going for it in the end is those two actionpacked scenes and given how much of a chore it is to watch the rest of the film they are not worth the price of a ticket,fantasy
i had a lot of expectations for this one the visuals seemed stunning the action heartthrobbing and the cast remarkable and those thing were there but i just couldnt shake the feeling of this movie being nothing more than a paycheckall the memorable dialog scenes and concepts seemed all too familiar the bullet cam was taken from the video game max payne the keyboard to the face scene from an internet show called purepwnage the last line was also taken from a famous bob ross parody the train cart scene was reminiscent of an old childrens show based on a popular toy and i could go oni can look away and call them a coincidence but the last straw was the story it was preposterously bad nothing made any sense it seemed like they just pulled it out of a hat to house the action all the characters the protagonist has to fight have no depth to them this guy can do this this guy can do that and in the end the hero has to fight the guys that can do this or that patheticas i exited the theater trying to keep my mind off the senseless favorable criticism that was going on behind me i heard someone say if i was 13 and saw this movie it wouldve been the best movie ever and thats what it is a childrens movie that tried to captivate the adult mind through pointless sex scenes and drama,fantasy
yet another teen wet dream on the screen any adolescent could dream up such a hey look at how cool i am story i myself 23 daydream now and then butt i wouldnt make a movie out of some delusion of grandeur this movie just pushes the credibility to far i mean how special or talented do you have to be to be able to stop a bullet with another bullet and they pick there targets out of a peace of cloth hmmthey dont explain things very well and in the end what really happened he works in a dead end job becomes an assassin gets betrayed takes revenge with rats and then asks us what have we done lately i say make love not war,fantasy
the problem with action flicks is that for every good lethal weapon batman enter the dragon t2 assassins and die hard you get 500 utterly godawful crapsandwiches like it could have been great if they put as much attention on his training as the crew did for batman begins or as much gritty realism as the dark knight or as much suspense as assassins or as much natural humor as lethal weapon but no they made a cross between office space the matrix and gross pointe blank whooptyfriggin doo emphasis on the doo once the the initial shinyshock wears off people will be shaking their heads in disbelief wondering what they had to be smoking in order to give this curlyturd anything more than 3 stars,fantasy
i watched the trailer and went to the theater excepting to see a good action movie filled with great special effectsthats what i got but this movie is innovating because the story has actually some really nice twists this isnt the usual he looks like an ordinary man but with the right training he becomes amazing after the training he gets a hot girl and lives really happy the twists are really unexpected and angelina jolies character isnt just another hotcool chick she actually has some depth the humor sort of reminded me of shoot em up has a great timing and it keeps the main focus on the action and the storythe actors did a real good job but thats what i was expecting from them james mcavoy and morgan freeman were really good the action scenes are unrealistic a bit too superman but thats what makes the action scenes so cool he can curve bullets the special effects are great if you like action you will love this movie if you are not sure about watching it give it a chance it might surprise you,fantasy
back when i first saw the trailer for i have to say that i was more puzzled and assumed the movie would just flop instead i had friends who were just crazy about the movie i also work at a movie theater so i saw a lot of the audience walking out and going crazy over it i had to see what all the rave was about so my friend and i checked it out a couple days ago and this was one of the funnest action movies i have seen in a long time one of the things i loved about this movie was despite how unrealistic it was that was what had made it so much fun we need a good action movie that you can just let go of reality and just enter this world where you can kick butt while doing the most incredible stunts now ill admit i have never read the comics this also seemed like the newer fight club but i think this is one of the funnest movies i have seen this summerwesley gibson has a crummy life dead end job a girlfriend who cheats on him with his best friend and a father he never knew but all that changes when he meets the girl of a life time fox he meets fox in a store and not only does she tell him that his father was an assassin who just was murdered but she has a major shoot out with a man who is the killer of his dad she takes wesley to a factory where the assassins maned the fraternity sloan who is the leader trains wesley to be a top assassin and to kill his fathers murderer but at least thats what wesley is led to believe into a shocking endingi think does deliver all it promises i know there are a lot of people who are upset that supposedly that this isnt faithful to the comic series but i think that some just need to let go because no matter what you have to admit that this was just a wild ride im not a huge fan of angelina jolies but dang this girl just rocked and was so hard core i to be fox morgan freeman made such a great sloan he has a great skill of being a leader and someone that everyone admires i also loved his line kill this well its a bad word that i cant say youll have to see the movie to know what i am talking about but is worth your money and time its a fun action film that will leave you wanting more810,fantasy
is a very sex action movie first of all jolie is a very sexy as the mysterious and troubled fox beyond the fact that jolie is reason alone to watch the flick the storyline is decent not incredible but entertaining the visuals of this movie are top notch at times the images almost seem 3d the way the action is set up is fastexciting and totally captivating movie viewers will be engaged through the whole movie holding on with their eyes for dear life but this movie is more than visuals or fast paced actionits comedy this movie is comedy at its finest the characters of this movie are developed and likable which only adds to the movie as a whole is a good time,fantasy
has to be one of the best films of 2008 so far the action is incredible and remains consistent throughout the movie watching this i felt like angelina was the real deal i could definitely picture her as an assassin in real life james mcavoy is a very likable character definitely a step up from the lion the witch and the wardrobe then theres morgan freeman seeing a gentleman like him wielding a gun might just be why this movie is memorable while some claim this film to be a reminisce of matrix i would have to disagree because the storyline is truly original curving guns and shooting wings off a fly you cant get more awesome than that with its comic book essence twist turning story line i would think that anyone would hope to be,fantasy
the rule of cool is what this entire movie lives on but it does not work no because there is no suspension of disbelief this movie ped me off because it was constantly insulting my intelligence with a straight face the plot and the characters are completely random and nonnonsensical oh hes just saying that i bet youre thinking which is why in the following there are spoilers can hardly call it that though since none of it has any significance to what you would call a storyso what is so random how about exploding rats and magical baths that cure any wounds instantly having increased bloodflow will give you lightning reflexes and godlike stamina despite the fact that you have lived your entire life as a shy accountant becoming a master assassin is simple just let strange people abuse you for a while a main character that goes to any length to avenge the death of a father he has never known in his entire life twice yeah and spying on someone never letting yourself be known or do anything at all to intervene with their life shows you care also you should kill people you know nothing about simply because someone tells you their name making a train derail on a bridge killing hundreds of innocents is justified in order to kill one man who is opposing an organization of assassins who operate by the rules of a cult if you suddenly hit your office coworker hard enough to punch out their teeth they will obviously think you are the man the list goes onthere are as many plot holes as action sequences ie a lot and every action sequence completely disregards the laws of physics for no apparent reason this is only attempted to be explained once by your heart beats faster then a regular human therefore you can shoot the wings of a fly literally but even if you can swallow that this only applies to two people in the movie yet everyone apparently has blatant superhuman abilities laws of nature does not apply as long as people die what no no movie just no bad movieas the movie progressed i cared less and less about the characters or what was going on none of it made any sense after a while i was just waiting for the pink elephants to marsh in playing their trombonesthe action itself should at least be cool but its all completely ridiculous the movie can not even pull of a decent exiting scene because i just could not buy into any off it gun kata galore the art of automatically knowing where everyone is so you dont even need to see them to shoot them and guns that dead people drop just conveniently fall into your hands if you are badass enough shooting with a gun that has an object stuck in the barrel makes it backfire writers read a ing book even street fighter the movie was fun because you could at least get a good laugh out of it this is just mind numbinga weaving machine produces a weave that a secret organization translates into binary code getting ascii letters that spell out the names of people who have to die why because fate says sohow are you supposed to be able to take that seriously a five year old on drugs would not blurt out something like that and from there it just gets worse yet the movie seems to take itself dead serious this is not satire if you believe enough you can shoot bullets in arcs around objects and hit targets no you cant just do random stuff for absolutely no reason at all it does not matter how good your cgi effects are its still entirely pointless writing random words on bullets that fly by is not clever its abuse of rendering power that the cgi department could be using to make something worthwhile i wish i could unsee this movie a movie that has morgan freeman and angelina jolie they alone should be able to make the movie at least watchable just goes to show that no matter how much money you pour into a worthless script and a director that only cares about special effects it will not produce gold,fantasy
i just saw and i must say what an awful movie the reasons are obvious maybe the director us to learn to shoot bullets in curved paths or maybe he to get closer to making something legendary such as the matrix but this movie was really bad with hardly a plot in the first place the movie cannot even be called actionoriented leave alone character development in the movie the acting was nothing overthetop the action sequences were repetitive and the movie was quite boring there has been no explanation as to who the person who was killed on the rooftop in the starting scene was the fatewhat a dumb name is not even described we are not even told how it selects its name and if a loom of thread is so intelligent then how come it gave out the names of the assassins who were supposed to die and still kept giving out names knowing that the only people who followed its orders were going to be killed by it there is no telling as to how many assassinations wesleys father did or any other person as a matteroffact did moreover when he read about his socalled fathers assassinationsafter his visit from the fates room all i can see in the movie is still a bulletbending technique the origin of the fraternity is hardly explained with no discussion on its principles or teachings wesleys father couldnt shout aloud that he was his fatherof all the times he saw his son before his own son planted a bullet into his chest the fraternity members went blind and couldnt see the bullet joliefox fired to kill them all and instead of getting divided all the mice went into the buildingnot even one of them stayed back nobody should complain that bullet bending is wrong as the movie takes off on a hypothetical note but maybe the origin the meaning or the consequences of some of the things should have been explained the guy just realized that he had to do somethingie train harder and kill his dads murderer without even something meaningful said before it the scene to make him understand it whole boring scenes about making the protagonist learn knife fighting when all the meaning of it was that he just had to defeat the guy who taught him without doing anything specialhe didnt use knives even once in the whole movie even the comedy was rotten at places with the least funny dialogs pouring from all the directions all that i can say is that if you are a diehard action movie fan and if watching movies which dont exactly focus on the acting or the dialogs or the character or the plot development doesnt actually pi you off then you better go and buy the dvd and if you are not that type well you know better than this,fantasy
one of the more popular reviews on this movie at imdb by uniiq remarks as bullets curve heads get punctured hilarity ensues and rats explode peanut butter rocks btw youll smile besides yourself im sorry did i miss something heads getting punctured is supposed to be hilarious i love violent action films and i enjoy black comedy but a good action film knows when to take itself seriously and a good black comedy knows that violence is painful even when the events around it are absurd yes you can mix the two genres  kiss kiss bang bang is a fine moment of this  but it requires a real delicacywhich this movie hasnt got the first third is an amusing look at a nerd who suddenly finds himself in a comic book world of professional assassins the second third is simply unpleasant the nerds occasionally sadistic initiation into that world the third act is high concept  james bond in the empire strikes back and unfortunately the concept doesnt work towards the end although we know exactly whats going on the film has lost its focus just as a film  that is as a story cinematically told  and we end up not giving a damfinally theres the acting  the nerd is a wimp the supporting characters get hammy or wooden and the actors who actually know what acting is dont have anything much to do here  including angelina jolie who is almost completely wasted anybody who thinks this movie is sexy obviously hasnt reached pubertynot a total loss as a dumb action movie  but blockbuster i think not,fantasy
this is one of the best action movies i have seen in awhile it had some great plot twists and just totally kick ass scenes it also had humor in spots that made you laugh out loud i thought angelina did a great job in her role the action genre is most definitely for her because she does shine as a kick ass type and not to mention her body was sick in this movie hot hot hotmorgan freeman was great as always and common also did good with what her was given i promise you with the way a lot of the twist happen you will never see sertian things coming even if it was right under your nose the entire time i was like wow when i realize some things and noticed how they made since to the plot i promise youm this movie does not disappoint in any way shape or form,fantasy
in some ways it was goodthe volume screeching screaming  what amounted to loud noise was a turn offthe constantlyinmotion camera made it hard to see what was happening this trend in film making upsets methe fairy dust of curved bullets and leaping a hundred feet and crashing through plate glass easily and more or less dancing in the air wore out its welcome early in the moviei was worried that there was too little of a story line which meant they would have to stoop to some trick or a weird twist major twist we come to find out i didnt like ityes it was cartoon funpeanut butter rocks the rats were funny but not plausible yes no  the movie is not suppose to be plausible i understand but the rat bombs were not plausible within the universe the film makers set up early on in the film so much work for a two second diversion so he could be come a killing machine i mean he kills so many just one guy it got old after the first ten guys died at his hand and when you dont think much of your story you try to add a second twist which came off as  really bad did the film maker assume he could shove a large tube of nothing down our open throats without reprisal at 50 minutes i was over it all i missed not having a real story line set ups for a epic twist are so m nightshadea cartoon at best,fantasy
dont be fooled by the trailer this is one of the dumbest summer movies to come out in a long timetake a little matrix add a heaping spoonful of fight club take a pinch of minority report and add a ton of very bad acting and pointlessly gratuitous violence and you have it was so ridiculously bad that i was actually embarrassed for the actors who are great in other films oh morgan freeman what have you donei saw this in a packed theater and about a third of the people walked out im still cursing myself for not joining them if you want a fun summer movie go see iron man instead if you havent already otherwise wait for the dark knight,fantasy
is basically a sexviolence fantasy for adolescent boys a nerdy cubicle worker is recruited by ultra sexy angelina jolie and becomes a super assassinthankfully this film is saved by doses of humor that make the predictable plot and thin story bearablejames mcavoy is surprisingly good speaking with a perfect american accent angelina is scary sexy as the femme fatale assassin recruiter morgan freeman practically sleepwalks through his role but is still enjoyablethe story is completely ridiculous one of the main plot points involves binary code weaved into textiles another thing that happens is during shootouts they prevent themselves from being shot by shooting the bullet that is coming towards themif you like seeing slow motion closeups of people being shot in the head then is the movie for you,fantasy
a fraternity of ancient assassins hmmgh i yet cringe at the thought of having parted with 4 to see this typical hollywood recycled action garbage the only redeeming aspect of a stomachchurning blood fest laden with mindnumbing stupidity was morgan freeman who must be behind on his rent angelina jolie however typecast as herself is quite natural as an emaciated bad a whose weak lines and pouty expression are at best worthy of a courtesy smirk as to james mr tumnus mcavoy he is absolutely unconvincing as an assassina nerd indeed but little else i was hoping for something genuinely original and impressive at least worth a 4 movie ticket aside from the nowstandard matrix ripoff vehicle chases but ended up both sickened and cheated by the rampant stupidity that just wouldnt let up,fantasy
full of nonstop action sexy impossible is all these and shamelessly flaunts it and with good reason its a popcorn flick summer is upon us and most moviegoers demand a few solid action films and deliversweve seen this plot before a nobody discovers that heshe is a somebody and develops their abilities thanks to the guidance of a superdudedudette the nobody is cubicleboundanxietyproneloser wesley gibson james mcavoy atonement stuck in a deadend job he constantly feels overwhelmed by his supervisor and must take anxiety medication to settle himself until one day he meets his dudette the appropriately named fox angelina jolie a mighty heart who saves him from the deadly crosshairs of cross thomas kretschmann king kong an assassin gone rogue from within a group known as the fraternity told initially by the leader of this group a man named sloan morgan freeman 10 items or less that the fraternity is a group of good assassins who do fates bidding by getting their kill assignments from something known as the loom of fate wesley mcavoy enters their ranks in roughshod fashion being beaten sliced healed and then beaten and sliced again to toughen him up for the job he must dohis goal though is to kill the man who killed his previously unknown father cross being the assassin of wesleys dad but if turning a noaccount accountant into a killer werent enough theres a notsosubtle twist that many might see coming as they watch this bullet swerving action moviemcavoy is completely believable as the dweebinfused officeboyturnedgunslinger making the premise of the film a joy and watching the sexy angelina jolie whip out massive handguns and hit her targets nearly without fail is something thatll make your actionpackedweekend fun she seems so comfortable doing impossible and ridiculous stunts that it makes them seem possible and plausiblefor those in the mood for a great shoot em up this ones a winner,fantasy
first off james mcavoy is terrible not only that his fake american accent is cringing angelina jolie is solid as usually but just a pretty face easily could have been replaced by a lesser named actress and achieved the same result therefore used just to bring in fans morgan freeman is miscast like always since shawshank basically the film is so crap that they narrate every tens minutes to tell you whats going on  why when the film is predictable storyline is something out of some idiots head some matrix wannabes whos trying to make the slowmotion action parts so good as to make you forget about the crap storyline and acting dont wast your money on this film i couldnt believe what i was seeing when i was in the cinema i thought it was a joke if it were up to me it would be straight to dvd dont trust the people that say its the best film of 2008,fantasy
if you havent watched then you must its been a long time seeing so much action in a single movie from the start till end the action goes on and on and onstunts are veryi mean very very far fetched like in matrix in matrix the story line supports those flying and bullet dodging but the story line and reasoning in is not so acceptablebut are they good  yes yes yesthey dont just doge the bullets they actually swing themyes man they make a arc with it also they do gymnastics with car and they are pictured so good you may want see them again and againas for actors james mcavoy fits the role soo perfectly u cant imagine anybody else in this role angelina is hot hot and hotmorgan freeman dont need to say as usual the man makes a standoverall an amazing entertainer,fantasy
it was like i was watching karate kid reloaded except in there was no reason given for all this nonsenselike all bad movies you get the feeling what the makers of the movie were so thrilled about one special effect bullets hitting each other that they made a movie based only on this and containing only this even im a fan of action movies based on comics loving special effects and loving to ride along with the story made me yawn and hate my friends for choosing this movie instead of anything elseit has nothing in fact was so stupid that made me create an account with imdb only to be able to write this comment so others make a better use of their time,fantasy
be prepare to park your intelligence at the door there is little to look forward to in this movie except one unbelievable scene after another the only thing that kept my interest was angelina joliethis is a rental however to show how low the publics standards have sunk some people actually clapped at the end many people laughed during the movie so i know not all of us have lost all hope maybe they clapped because the movie was overwhen will hollywood stop insulting usi expected more and i more wait a minute maybe thats why they called it,fantasy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning wesley gibson james mcavoy has a boring job working behind a desk without the guts to stand up to his bullying boss or do anything about the fact his best friend is shagging his girlfriend but that all changes one night in a convenience store when a lady named fox angelina jolie saves him from being killed by the guy who killed his father he learns his father was part of an organization called the fraternity whove been around for many years killing those selected from a weaving machine whose existence poses a threat to others the head of the organization sloan morgan freeman has him trained to be like his dad and he progresses well until an apparent assassination attempt on him draws him to a man named pekwarsky terrence stamp who casts a different light on thingsis adapted from a graphic novel as is becoming quite the craze at the moment and seems to rely more on the flashiness and style of this than anything deeper a grown up comic book of a movie with gratuitous sex violence and swearing by the bucketload this truly feels like a big case of style over substance with a messy convoluted possibly overambitious plot that as others have noted does bear similarities with the matrix with thin characterization and a deadly lack of substance ive not heard of director timur bekmambetov before but i bet he had some sort of past as a music video director or something along those lines because thats the impression his film gives offcast wise a wide range of famous name actors from jolie to freeman fail to make anything out of such uninspiring and flat characters and when talents like this cant save anything you know youre in troubleits not awful its sharp and well written in parts with some funny lines and some cool stunts including killing a mafia guy while in a car flying over him and a nice bit involving a train going off the rails toward the end but it all seems to drag rather than keep you hooked never mind what ive said though enough people liked it that a sequels apparently already being made but from me its certainly most un,fantasy
this movie was a thrill ride almost from the start our main character to be honest with everyone i never heard of angelina jolie is sexy as ever in this bring in terrance stamp and morgan freeman thats a recipe for success our main character an office worker is picked on and bullied by the boss well eventually he finds out he is a long lost descendant of a big time killer he has powers that cannont be perceived by most they teach him so many things that i honestly cant remember them all in here but they were way cool trust me i remember now something about teaching him how to fight and shoot how to curve bullets stuff like that morgan freeman plays the head honcho all in all a pretty good action thrill ride of a movie not to be picked apart and bashed by people expecting this movie to win an oscar and take it self seriously sit back and enjoy the ride people,fantasy
i typically never write a review on a film that ive already seen more than once because i insist on the review reflecting my first and strongest impression of the film but after watching for what must be the 5th or 6th time now i suddenly felt like writing something anyway so here i golet me begin by saying this is one strange film strange in the sense that its literally like a train wreck that you cant keep your eyes off because its so fascinating to watch and you almost feel sick with guilt and exhilaration because youre enjoying it so much violence never looked so gorgeous before is about a guy named wesley gibson who is such a hopeless pathetic dweeb that even google wont return any results when he types in his own name he is rescued from his pitiful cubicle existence by a gorgeous woman named fox who recruits him into an organisation of assassins known as the fraternity supposedly because they believe he is the only person who can kill the man who killed his father little does he know just how drastically his life will actually change once he agrees to join themthe casting of the film is spoton james mcavoy has already proved himself to be a versatile actor and he is very believable as a weak pushover who finds confidence in the fact that group of trained assassins apparently believe in his abilities he also makes his character likable and fun to watch because he delivers it with a sense of humour and you can actually relate to him because his situation is so understandable basically hes just another slave to the wage looking for a way to break free this way is initially offered to him by angelina jolie and who could say no to a woman like that ms jolie plays a role that seems like it could only have been written specifically for her who else could play a beautiful and deadly assassin whos charismatic and covered in tattoos she could and would kill you in a heartbeat and yet you just want to be near her morgan freeman plays sloan the leader of the fraternity and well i hardly need to elaborate on this one do i he makes pretty much every film hes in worth watching and thats all i need to saynow i titled this review beautiful garbage thats not so much because the film itself is garbage because its not but rather because the events portrayed in this film are so brutal and merciless that they could only come from a very dark and rotten place the beautiful is directed at the visual effects because everything ranging from camera techniques to production design to action choreography is so beautifully done so thrillingly eyepopping that it would almost make you forget that youre watching people get slaughtered beat up and maimed tons of blood flow brains are splattered against the wall and yet you cant take your eyes off that beautifully designed bullet that awesome tattoo on angelina jolies hand interlacing with the engravings on her gun those mindblowing car chase scenes that guy jumping through the glass out of a skyscraper just to finish his job this film is visual effects executed to perfection elevating said perfection to a whole new level its all so pretty to watch that it would almost make you able to forgive the writers the overpowering lack of realism almost the staggering amount of ideas and actions that are 98 of the time either inconsistent improbable or flatout impossible would in any other case surely put any screenwriter out of work with a film like this its literally only the wrapper that makes the candy sweet it just goes to show that sometimes making something really really pretty can make it worth watching just so long as youre willing to suspend every inch of disbelief for the sake of watching pretty pictures nature science biology and every other form of technical factuality is being put to the test here which is not to say its basically just being thrown out the window but hey i can promise you youre going to get to see a guy get in a car the way youve never seen before and a girl get on a train in a fashion that defies every rule of physics its all worth it for a totally cool putyourbraininstandbymode kind of action flick director timur bekmambetov has obviously tried his darnedest to make his mark in hollywood with his first english spoken bigbudget effort and may i say he couldve done a lot worse not to mention the fact that he has managed to recruit a few very big names to top the bill this is definitely a hollywood debut to be proud of i can only hope he will continue to work with the same excellent crew in the future because although only the sound department was nominated for an oscar camera and visual effects would have definitely deserved a nod from the academy tooin a nutshell is 110 minutes of gorgeous eyepleasing nonsense with great action and one very beautiful lady i for one cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
i caught this movie on tv and was amazed i hadnt seen it at the cinema i thought the premise was good the action scenes exciting and had me on the edge of my seat and the whole thing was intelligently done mcavoy was believable as boy becomes man and jolie was suitably understated jolie reminded me of trinity in the matrix and was a more grownup role than tomb raider i hadnt noticed mcavoy before and now want to see more that he has done i didnt think that morgan freeman brought much more to the role than anyone would have done perhaps im thinking again of the matrix and how morpheous was playedthere were enough twists for it not to be too predictable and some nice plants on the narrative that made sense later on i even rated the background music as being perfectly pitched to the mood and the action,fantasy
try as hard as i might there was just no way i could get through the movie that was timur bekmambetovs intro to the us and to scififantasy fans everywhere night watch it had nothing to do with the subtitles  im rather used to those by now the trailer for the movie looked amazing so when i finally got to it and saw how overthetop all the effects work was for some reason i found it to be a turnoff therefore i did just thatturned the movie off i had no preconceived ideas about when it was first released because i didnt have the advantage or disadvantage maybe of having read the mark millar graphic novel all i knew from the previews is that angelina jolie and morgan freeman were in it and because it looked so much like a matrix ripoff it was a definite wait for the dvd selection in my book so i waited and finally rented it once the end credits rolled and i discovered that bekmambetov was the director it really didnt surprise me what did bowl me over is that not only did his style fit this story but that is one of the most preposterously entertaining movies i watched through all of 2008 yes it definitely resembled the matrix more than just a little but unlike that densely layered trilogy it cheerfully and stubbornly refused to take on the earnest deadseriousness of the wachowski brothers cyberpunkedout mythology and was all the better for not doing soi guess its no secret by now that contrary to how it was presented in the oftseen trailers the hotterthanmountpinatubolava angelina jolie does not have the starring role here though her character is pivotal to the wild plot line that actually falls to james mcavoy the last king of scotland the chronicles of narnia who tries on an american accent which works for the most part to play dumped on neerdowell wesley gibson a man so mired in his own inability to care about his life or anything in it he even buys the condoms his best friend is using to bang his girlfriend with the selfloathingselfpitymasochist angle is familiar to us all but gets poured on so thickly after the slambang opening of the first act that we know that something incredible has to be coming down the pike to shake wesley from his debilitating sense of ennui that appears in the delectably dangerous form of fox jolie a superassassin who in short order not only tells the nebbishy office drone that his own estranged father is also a prokiller of the highest order but that the man who did him in at the movies opening is out to eliminate wesley as wellleading to the movies first and most breathtaking chase sequence if youve seen the matrix you know how to spell it out from here the estimable morgan freeman stands in here for laurence fishburne the matrix itself makes an appearance here in the form of the looms of fate as tended by the organization of clandestine killers known as both the weavers and the fraternity and bullet time gets a whole new reimagining as weapons and ammo bend and twist in ways that conventional firepower is not meant to and of course once wesley descends far enough into this particular rabbit hole nothing is even close to what it initially appeared to be when he finally emerges from the other end ive read other reviews where viewers really took this movie to task for not adhering to the original millar concept and characters since i have no previous knowledge of any of that i can only go by the impression this movie left on me and i can tell you that i was completely entertained which is really all i was hoping for at the time welldone visual effects great performances by the cast and one line delivered by freeman that probably brought the house down in the theaters where it played plus a fittingly cool and pulsepounding soundtrack by danny elfman admittedly was tailormade to appeal to 13yearold gamers and fanboys and the 13yearold in me definitely approved,fantasy
i like action movies and every now and then i will sacrifice a good movie plot for some mindless easy to watch action however this film asks too much i knew from the trailers that this would have some ridiculous action scenes but i did not realize how far the boundaries of stupidity could be pushed and how much i would regret paying and wasting my time to see this moviemost movies that show impossible implausible action scenes have an excuse for instance the marvel movies where the characters have super powers making the action scenes justified this movie gives no excuse or a very very poor one for the insane far fetched insulting stuntsas well as the ridiculous action which is fairly unoriginal and has been seen before and in better quality and context the story line is so bad it looks like the audience is at wimbeldon as they are all shaking their heads in time at the plot,fantasy
to go with the clich that was just a waste of 2 hours of my life this film doesnt deserve any original criticism anyway it would be a waste of more of my time there are many reasons for my disgust with the film practically nothing was realistic the motivation for the lead was oh so lacking and what the hell was that stupid thing with the mice leave the mice alone only a petty mind with think to kill a bunch of animals just to get at a target in a movie or otherwise just cause you have angelina jolies butt in one of the scenes doesnt mean you get my rating im not that easy this is most likely the worst film i will ever see,fantasy
shoot this mothafka a catchy line said by morgan freemans character is going to go down in history as one of the most memorable taglines in the history cinema up there in the same level as say hello to my little friend is as ridiculous as it is awesome the concept is so far fetched and yet the visual effects are very well done you wont mind seeing those curving bullets some more it is a high octane eye candy entertaining action flickbased on a graphic novel ive never read so i cant really do a comparison but seeing that its got plenty of silly off the wall sequences i can imagine that something like this could only exist from the vision a graphic novelists creative mind a bullet crashes in a head on collision with another bullet that kinda stuff will leave you saying come on get the f outta here but the truth is doesnt care about people who think too much this is a movie for those of us who choose not to overanalyze it and insteadwe need to just let the movie show us what its got for everything that it can offerthe storyline is decent at times its very predictable but thats no surprise in fact besides the curving bullet deali dont think its completely an original thing i think theyre right when they say that is like matrix on steroids and thentheres a part where james mcavoys character jumps into a window of a warehouse and starts killing everybody that reminds me of christian bale in a scene from the movie equilibriumyou gotta hand it to em thoughcinematographer mitchell amundsen and director timur bekmambetov have made the movie look as thrilling as possible danny elfmans upbeat catchy original score does help a lot in getting our mood into the adrenaline rush and i think every action movie fan everywhere will not get disappointed some might just say its all right but i doubt that many would say its a failuremy friend who watched the movie with me screener yara made a very good point concerning the underlining theme despite the strong violence and the slo mo bullet time it does to a certain extent has a lesson to learn why do we live day by day being bored and miserable when we know we have the talents to be and do so much moreangelina jolie in this movie is more of a supporting role she doesnt get much line to say her presence is more for looks so that the movie would have one badass killer with killer looks james mcavoy is excellent at playing a guy whos scared shless morgan freeman has played a bad guy before lucky number slevin so its good to see him not playing a good guy again hell have that cold stare like something bad is about to happen if you keep eyeballing himwere not saying you should go out there and start learning how to become an assassin the point is if you have what it takes to speak your mind and do something you know youre destined to do but you choose to get stuck being pushed around because you cant stand up for yourself thats just as pathetic as not doing anything at all what have you done today and if its the same thing you did yesterday and the same thing youll do tomorrow then theres definitely something wrong with the picture,fantasy
my tastes for movies are transformers matrix iron man die hard series national treasure etc i have seen many action movies and was really looking forward to seeing this movie i had heard great reviews prior to its release then i started hearing that the plot was super thin and that it was really not very good so we started thinking hancocka couple of friends of ours talked us into seeing this abomination instead the reviews were wrong this movie wasnt bad it was awful the plot had way too many holes and was nothing close to the matrix whoever made that comment should seriously be stripped of their rights to review moviesthe only thing the four of us was our money back everyone in the theater it was a small one agreed that this movie was written during the writers strike either that or someone was paid a big favor by releasing this garbageseriously i would rate this as a maybe on showtime but not ondemand,fantasy
initially this comment was deleted by imdb based on an abuse report filed by another user following the advice of ms molly from the help desk i posted it again since it does not violate any rules please do not delete it again if anyone reports it for abuse take your time to check and see any complain is unjustified and illmeant thank youit would be a bit hard to translate into english all my review that i wrote for the romanian cultural websites cinemagia and liternet but on the other hand it might be worth since i tried to explain there why is so good this nutty superaction hyperwacko fairy tale the main merit is the total lack of inhibitions in its system of defying all the known rules of physics biology psychology society and so on its charmingly absurd in an extremely clever sensefurther the humor is involved in a very subtle way not at all explicit although obvious bekmambetov never presumes to wink at the audience same as hitchcock spielberg and the most 007 series directors did he trust us to understand the full import of his megajoke  and in a very respectful wayat last the professional angle is absolutely commendable kudos for the extreme carefulness in minutely crocheting this sophisticated farce masterfully choreographed at all levels one of my favorite shots was that of angelina jolies hairs gently waving in the draft caused by the bullet circumventing her face  to be later recalled in a very elegant tchekhov rifle effect in the final and tragic trick of he circular gunshot in the rotunda definitely bekmambetov is a stylist in course of searching his way and im sure we can expect big time deliveries from him in the future,fantasy
theres a trend in these big budget action moves to try and support the thing with hefty story components profundity explorations of fate and power often via revealed conspiracies we come to expect this and i believe have rather clear thresholds about what works i think when you try to these ambitious story arcs you have to pay attention to these thresholds for all its faults the matrix films impose style on a robust enough narrative you have to have a narrativehere we have a story line young nerd with hidden powers revenges his father only to discover deceit then he takes revenge on the deceivers that could have worked if it had been supported it has before right theres all sorts of metanoir possibility here the ordinary man picked out and placed in a situation long since determined the idea of death being visited on people directed from supernatural sources by seemingly supernatural agents the idea of fate weaving in lives and so on the cinematic ideas of a man whose vision slows things down and as narrator for us in voice and sightbut its all given short shrift here we cannot rely on this narrative to carry us hitchocks wife was in charge of vetting scripts for this property of robustness and i believe that the threshold of what can accept in speculative noir was discovered or defined by her this fails which basically leaves us with some very energetic and brutal stylizations within which we can encounter angeline i suppose that because of these roles she is the most bankable actress in the world i do think she knows how to do this in smith she drove the story simply with her attitude in tomb raider 1 i think she successfully defined this persona a confident sexual being who could match any male film presence thats what this is all aboutshe actually does support that well enough in the early chase scene where its her movie but then we have to start relying on the narrative to move us along and we get stuck with morgan freemans silliness she simply becomes a watcher with nothing to do she cannot carry it off because theres nothing to fill no movement to get behindand so much of it fights itself theres a hint of a sexual relationship but its random theres a training session that makes no sense at all and seemingly is inserted only to film brutality theres much made of curved bullet paths is this a supernatural talent or special bullet designs or something to do with spin while shootingbut you know i could have tolerated the whole thing all the rats the predictability the incoherence until the very end where our transformed wimp looks directly at us and challenges us with something so remarkably real that it subverts the whole fragile fantasy the implied humor it was so disturbing i credit that encounter as all the power of the film it was dumb blunt and repellent oh theres a crude use of the redhead type as the petty tyrant of the heros officeteds evaluation  1 of 3 you can find something better to do with this part of your life,fantasy
httpeattheblindsblogspotcomi detested the trailers and im not a fan of genepool lottery winner angelina jolie so one movie i never thought id sit down to watch was timur bekmambetovs action orgy problem was i kept coming across reviews that wrote about this film being a pleasant surprise considering all i had to lose was an hour and a half i thought id give it a shot surprise surpriseactually is a pleasant surprisethis surprise didnt come easy and it most definitely didnt come early the first fifteen minutes or so was nothing less than a flip imitation of fight club so lame that my finger hovered over the stop button on my computer but patience prevailed and once wesley gibsons james mcavoy fate was altered there truly was no turning back when shifts into second gear it does so with a resounding thump of unbridled torque once screams aloud that its a thrill ride it does something few action films ever have the smarts to do  it winks at the audiencethis wink lets us know this isnt the real world but that this is a movieand a very silly movie at that the remainder of is crammed full of implausibly overthetop yet very slick and expertly choreographed action sequences each one upping the ante of ridiculousness reminds us being silly and ridiculous is not the exclusive realm of the farrelly brothers and not since john woo made an art form out of corny overthetop action films has there been something with so much adrenaline and laughoutloud silliness aswithin this realm of excessive camp angelina jolie fits as snug as silk stockings not that i would actually know the more serious she plays her character fox even the name is a groan inducing pun the more you cant hate her freakishly abnormal good looks and constant mugging for the camera if she does take herself this seriously in real life then she must be excruciating company but if she has the sense of humor to understand her role here then props to her her cheesy performance is destined to be parodied yet few parodies will ever come close to besting her own efforts she delivers every line of dialogue as if it were her last and every catlike motion she slinks across the screen with is deliberately bon3r baitingbeyond jolie the cast in is first rate mcavoy does the fishoutofwater routine with ease and morgan freeman is wellmorgan freeman the pleasant bonus appearance is terence stamp who is in my mind one of the most underused actors around i cant believe im saying it but i had a laugh out loud riot watching never having met john woo or timur bekmambetov i cant say for sure if they take this junk seriously but if taking the pi out of a tired genre is their thing then theyre experts at this craft if on the other hand theyre not in on the jokewell at least theyre getting rich getting laughed at,fantasy
this movie was utterly embarrassing  me and my friends decided never to let it be known that we ever watched the movie and to disown it i mean come on  some loom giving out names of people to be killed action sequences made speed racer look realistic in comparison the movie was as pointless as it was stupid some monks while weaving discovered a binary code in the loom how do the zerosones correspond to letters was it ascii did it upgrade to unicode due to the recent globalization if youve seen the mahabharat and ramayan tv series of the mid80s in india you will remember those sequences where heroes would fire arrows that hit each other squarely at the tip and are neutralised this movie does the same with bullets  people neutralising each others bullets by firing a counterbullet to intercept it the jedi sith and neo seem lame and boring in comparison to the skills of the fraternity of assassins following the whims of a loom that communicates using a binary textual encoding as if thats not enough bullets dont seem to have inertia and seem to break newtons laws or maybe bullets bend space or whatever curving bullets around objects may have made it a lame actionmovie but a bullet travelling in a circular trajectory just makes the movie a great comedy,fantasy
if you ever want to see a film that is a conglomeration of every generic slick action film then go seei to like this film i truly did the first half was enjoyable the action silly but what i expected the protagonists character was likable and sympathetic despite the slightly fight club office feel after a brilliant section of him being trained not adding spoilers i was looking forward to the rest of the film playing outwrongthe film suddenly spirals down into a pit of frustration with all emphasis on telling a well built up story fused with ott action abandoned and left for dead at the side of the road in its place is a series of choppy scenes each one only serving to lead into the next scene so another ridiculous fight scene can take place for the first part of the film there was also interesting cinematography choices spliced with dark humour  this all dissipates into action action and action againit seems the director and script editors got together with a checklist of clichd moments plot devices and effects and ticked every damn one before high fiving each other and going off to spend three trillion dollars on the sfx bill again i found myself subjected to gratuitous slow down and speed up moments that seemed to be learnt from the 300 school of effects ps i like 300oh and i get it i know this is supposed to be a silly action film or is it the first half leads you to believe they are taking themselves very seriously albeit with crazy yet satisfying impossibilities in action scenes which only films like this can be provide its a shame shoot em up already took this idea and did way better and knew it was silly like smokin aces this film tries to be much slicker than it is and creates scenes which range from impressive to uncomfortable to watch and yes i know it originates from a comic thus was expecting ridiculousness it just got to the point where it wasnt interesting anymore the train scene is incredible from a visual standpoint but it reeked of noone caresi just wish this film could have improved on how it started and made up its mind on what it was going for it was even more ridiculous than the matrix style plausibility yet that is there for a reason shoot em up and crank are hilarious through their stupidity because that is what they are trying to be this seems to find itself tittering between the ott action film and the engaging thriller sprinkled with the extremely unoriginal cool factori wont go on about the plot in too much detail but really the final twenty minutes made me want to kill the nearest bystander for its mindbogglingly obvious play out and bland stereotypical twisti feel im focusing on the negatives here so heres a couple of positivesbreathtaking effects strong lead actorif youre watching this as a casual action flick then fine you will probably enjoy yourself is you set your brain to stupid mode but for me this wasnt a typical lads film as there was a lot going on and there was a lot of potential disappointing but not terrible saved only by its effects and acting in places610,fantasy
after reading all the hype watching the teasing trailers it comes down to one thing i had to go see it it seemed unique action packed and cool effects along with some nice stunts was i right mostly nothing real major was disappointing although some things were a minor the action was full and non stop very cool effects and some real nice shooting but not all was so great the film however started to get predictable until the unexpected end and turned out to be a little confusingthe cast was the best idea from the producer a great familiar cast with one or two legendary actorsactresses morgan freemanangelina jolie did wonderfully i too was actually quite impressed with james mcavoy role he played it perfectly moving on to the important bit in case your still wondering yes there is more then enough action the action scenes were also well panned out and effects of the curving bullets to the effects of the jumping and flips were brilliantly executedthe movie kicked off very well its always good to have a explosive beginning and this movie did just that it automatically gave you an idea of what is too come for the rest of the movie after the furious beginning the movie started to get a bit slow and then rose back up to the action again the ending was definitely strong unexpected and a great bursting with fury shooter scene but occasionally the film was sped up a bit to much with maybe one or two too many flash backs of sorts it had you quite puzzled at times but that doesnt take anything away from such a great filmmaybe all the hype before it came out had people expecting a tad too much thats where so many are disappointed but they really shouldnt be just forget what you heard and go see it plenty of action cool effects and mind blowing stunts also a witty and clever script,fantasy
i do not understand the people that hate this movies is one of the best action movies ive seen for several years gone is boring dialog and stories forget what you know of traditional shoot em up movies and prepare for something new the 90s had the matrix 2008 have not only is the special effects mindblowing but the story is also something completely different from what youve seen before the critics complain about that the movie isnt realistic well  if those people want a realistic story they should watch cnn news instead of a movie the lord of the rings wasnt realistic but still its rated as one of the best movies ever made if you like action with a lot of speed ill promise you that youll love,fantasy
i hope that this movie was not supposed to be smart in a matrix kind of way im pretty certain that it was intended to be more of a comedy then a action but for me this movie was way to exaggerated it was simply to many unbelievable and unrealistic events for meif you can relax with that and enjoy the movie for its action then ignore this commenti dont like to be negative and comment on films just because i dont like them its more fun to give a movie credit or at least good constructive criticism but this was one of the worst modern blockbusters i have ever seen,fantasy
a must see for the start of the summer just saw this movie and it has a bit of everything in it tons of action drama even a little comedy excellent acting and above average special effects the director did an excellent job and took me places i watch 100s of movies and really love horror scifi and action so believe me when i tell you to see this movie you will not be sorry i love it when they take a average person and take them to levels they wouldnt normally aspire to to the critics who are insulted by something a character says well think about this people  its only a movie  chill out and enjoy life,fantasy
this movie had everything going for it amazing caste excellent setup for a story and very high anticipation five minutes into the movie i can already feel the disappointment sinking in the violence and sex were explicit and pointless and all it did was leave a bad taste in my mouth the actual story is trite incongruous and not very original the protagonist is an emo loser that cries and moans about his miserable existence the message of the movie is that anyone that doesnt kill people for a living is not living their life to the fullest i recommend not wasting your money on this huge disappointment of a movie,fantasy
flashy action scenes and special effects did not compensate for the ludicrous plot unreliable characters and feeling that ive already seen parts of it before bottom linethis movie is just over doing itfor me it felt like the movie borrowed something from too many movies the matrix night watchcold harsh brutal bloodiness equilibrium and many morethe only amusing event happened after i compared this movie to night watch only to find that it was directed by the same directortimur bekmambetov im sorry to say that this time he failed to deliverplus side excellent music,fantasy
this is another film ive been looking forward to since it was first advertised i was actually worried it might not live up to the hype such as its been but i was very pleasantly surprisedmcavoy definitely wouldnt have been my first choice as a male lead for a film like this but then thats without the benefit of knowing how the film starts off we get a very good look at his life prethe fraternity and it is an excruciating and demeaning one like most of ours if were honest his terror and anxiety attacks complete the picture and the transformation to cold calculating assassin via cocky school boy attitude to his training is done extremely well by comparison jolie seems to be there for her looks more than anything  she says so little its almost shocking that said her characters depth is still portrayed well with looks and gestures besides jolies undeniable screen presence david ohara is a brilliant addition for the opening assassination sequence and morgan freeman as always is the manthe story builds up well enough although i might have gone a more flashy route with the whole assassinationexecution area that said its the conclusion that makes the film for me like many great works of artentertainment it is a very simple and direct idea hidden inside an elaborate piece of work and in the words of that conclusion what have you or i done lately,fantasy
what a cool action flick i dont know what more i can say it delivers in every way im not a fan of angelina but she was excellent i didnt know who james mccavoy was but he can sooooooooo be an action star and morgan freeman was a complete surprise youll know what i mean when you see it its something youll have to see at the movies unbelievable scenes you have to watch over and over  either for artistic value or just because they kick ass great score an interesting and thought provoking plot excellent special effects some of which havent been seen before or have been done in a stylish new way a movie with a unique sense of humor entertaining and just what i was looking for very recommended action flick,fantasy
and ive only done that once before  for national treasure 2 why is it that millions is spent on antipiracy advertising combating illegal dvds and yet good old plagiarism is seemingly welcomed the wachowski brothers matrix creators must have had a hearty old laugh at the trailer for this nonsense probably felt too much pity or were too hysterical to talk to their lawyers about suingalso i wonder at what point in his career morgan freeman decided you know what im going to stop challenging myself as an actor and just start collecting hefty sums for playing a wiseoldrelaxedauthoritativefatherfigure type guyone day i hope theres criminal penalties and a campaign of warning ads that tries to dissuade people from watching crap like this movies like do more damage to the industry than piracyi know this review is kinda smartass but check out the review in the independent uk if you think im way offbtw i walked out right after the scene with the car flying over the mafia guy and mcavoys character shoots the dude through the sunroof d its funny to even write this stuff,fantasy
let me get this straight i really dont mind dumb action movies ive enjoyed nearly every super hero movie ever made i liked die hard pirates of the carribbean shoot em up and a whole lot more but there is dumb and there is really dumb and falls it the latter category basically its the matrix on speed but without anything that made the matrix such a great movie ie cool characters a really cool premise and exciting action sequences while sure does have its share of action sequences i would not describe them as exciting they are very stylized and there are a couple of nice parts but for the most part you are shaking your head in disbelief at the overthetop nonsense the creators want you to swallow and thats just the action the story if you can call it that is even worse basically the main character is recruited by a supersecret society of assassins who get their targets by a magical loom that spits out binary code to kill one of their rogue members somehow he becomes the worlds best assassin in a couple of weeks by being beaten up for weeks an even obtains supernatural timeslowing and levitation powers after which he proceeds to take out a veritable army of highly trained fellow assassins with no effort whatsoever there are twists and turns everywhere but none of it makes any sense then theres the very obnoxious message basically this movie claims all normal people are losers because they are not fulfilling their potential which apparently adds up to killing your own father and assassinating random people because a magical machine tells you to in fact not just the message is obnoxious everything else is too there is not a likable character or good joke to be found anywhere in the movie i like james mcavoy but heres he just annoying and angelina jolie as usual is there for the looks only and why morgan freeman resorts to crap like this we will probably never know i really dont mind nonsense as long as its presented as nonsense but a movie that goes this far over the top and then still tries to be a serious and cool movie thats just too much watch the action sequences and fast forward through the rest410,fantasy
wow russian director timur bekmambetov sure made an impressive hollywood debut with this wantonly executed action flick will blow you away with its unbelievably slick action sequences and satisfactorily unique story loosely based on a mark millar comicjames mcavoy atonement last king of scotland pulls it off as wesley gibson an anxietyridden cubicle drone with a boring billings job his life turns 180degrees when he meets fox angelina jolie a hot assassin who clues him in on who he really is both are believable in their roles and feed off each others energy the supporting cast isnt too shabby either except maybe for too trite casting choice of morgan freeman as the leader of the fraternity of assassins but im just nitpickingincredibly hedonistic is an adrenaline rush gory yes but violence shouldnt be glamorized anyway so if you enjoy it you better put up with it look forward to the sequel which is already in the works meanwhile bekmambetovs famed vampire series may be worth checking out till then,fantasy
i never write reviews on imdb it takes too long but this movie blanked me offthe entire plot structure is stolen from the matrix and i mean directly ripped off some loser finds out hes oneinamillion with super crazy powers and he must join a group of people who will train him to use these powers against evil etc it doesnt stop there though angelinatrinity saves his life and takes him to morpheus freeman who explains their secret world to him and through brutal training he teaches him to dodge bullets or in this case make bullets dodge other things same storythe action is fun enough i guess but its almost all cgi and feels very fake i liked it better in shoot em up when the crazy blank was tongue in cheek here were just supposed to accept their mindbending reality without question and it gets real serious sometimes you cant have both seriouslythere are many other really obvious blankups here if you pay attention pick em out for yourself cause i wont list em allbottom line you never find out anything about these people or why they are assassins or who their boss is etc if you really wanna see this for the action my comments arent gonna stop ya some of the scenes are kinda fun but as a whole this movie is very hollow and nothing ill watch twice,fantasy
as consumers we vote with our wallets and the tide has been turning against consumers for years now have we come to the point that if the premise is great we dont care about the execution i just dont understand all these glowing reviews i am not some high brow movie consumer i just want to walk out of a movie without feeling like i just wasted my timethis movie wasted my time sure i do think the concept is a really great one no question the whole idea is really great no surprise as its from a comic did i read the comic nope but as an avid collector many years ago i know that there are some really great ideas in comics this movie cannot take credit for the concept peoplewhat it can take credit for is a total lack of execution i do not have issue with the first half of the movie everything up to the twist climax was standard summer movie fare nothing special besides the great concept but also nothing terrible though james mcavoys acting was borderline terrible i would probably rate it a 6 after that point it just fell apart and ruined anything positive this movie had to offer the story became worse than lame the characters less than 1 dimensional and the ending was a joke i wished i had walked out before the last 3045 minutesbasically it was a big buildup to an interesting climax then everyone in this movie had no idea where to go with it without spoilers its impossible to go into details so i will just say the movie went from a 6 to 6 but i cant give it less than a 1 it deserves 1i feel bad that we consumers have come to a point where there are enough people ready to settle for half a movie with a great concept taken verbatim from someone else to give this pile of trash glowing reviews i guess in the end this just proves that we get what we deserve,fantasy
best thing about this movie is its pace i was so glued to this pacey action flick that i forgot having sip of my coke and pop corn till intermission it reminded me of movies like speed and matrix sheer adrenaline and nothing else the story revolves around james mcavoys dull life and how he is losing everything there comes our super sexy angelina jolie to pull him out of this mess and taking him to where he belongs the world of nonstop action its a world of assassins called fraternity and he is one of them based on calculations done by fate a secret society these assassins with gifted skills are killing their targets james now in his new avatar of assassin is getting trained by fraternityled by morgan freeman building his super skills and stepping into his fathers shoes yes his father was an assassin too and been murdered james is now after his fathers killer but there is more that meet his eyes he is slowly getting close to reality which is not what he was told what is that truth will he finally take revenge of his fathers death these answers are the crust of the story which is brilliantly supported by special effects and its star castjames as a loser and trying best to come out of his dull life has done a superb job he is true to his character he was brilliant in his earlier ventureking of scotland too angelina is rock solid in such kickass roles and did a wonderful job this time too though i was bit disappointed with morgan freeman as he did not have much moments but is more about actions scenes and special effects the scenes where the shots take turns in the air and hit the target early car chasing scene and how these assassins kill their targets are brilliant i agree that all these stunts are next to impossible in real but the way these scenes are clubbed with the pace of movie is mind blowing the director is fast in narrating the story that you actually dont get a second to think what and how its happening i suggest all you action freaks should give it a try,fantasy
granted some stuff was far fetched echos of the matrix but all in all i kind of liked it i want to see it again and yes i think i will pay to see it again plus angie looked hoti cant believe the bad reviewsyoure willing to accept a man who turns into a green monster a race of people who are batteries for machines an alcoholic super hero a boy who gets bit by a spider and swings around town wrapping up criminals in spider websbut you cant accept curving bullets whats wrong with you it was fantastic i really liked itthe only thing is that it seemed to be over really fast i wished it was longera movie def see it if you like action and angiewhat the fk have you done lately,fantasy
this was possibly the worst film i have ever seen period a complete waste of time and money in visiting the not so local cinema what can i say apart from interesting plot poorly thought out screenplay with thoroughly unrealistic stunts and special effects the film never really go going until the last 20minutes but the most obvious issue was that you could predict what was going to happen well before it did and im no mediumif ever theres a reason to stay at home this film is it and if i could give it zero out of ten i wouldany reviewer here who gave this film more than three out of ten must have been watching a different film,fantasy
lazy sunday afternoon just finished roast dinner stick on dvd and be assaulted by stylised sequences of bullets going through peoples heads and angelina jolie looking like a bo selecta character on heroin seriously that jaw makes heavyweight champ valuev jealous this film is totally pointless we have to care about characters for action sequences to have any meaning hmmbored guy hates his job  i know lets do some killingavoid at all costscheery bye,fantasy
thats what i thought after i finished watching the movie and the very few extras on dvd action movies are not famed for their deep meanning but usually there is a basic plot justifying the action well not here its not just the lack of a believable plot even in the action hollywood context but also the absurdity of it a fraternity of assassins dated back to middle age with highly trained personel and hightech equipment kills targets dangerous to the world safety and order the problem is that the decision about who is dangerous for the world is extracted by analysing the fabric produced by a devine weaving machine based in an old factory resembling a castleits not just idiotic but impressively dangerous idea the one passed around here it tells us that extremely capable and intelligent persons take as granted everything a divine authoritytells them nobody questions the procedure they just do what the voice of fate tells them for the good of mankind who wrote that thing george bush they dont even explain how the magic machine came up and why it isnt a medieval one but industrial age modelthe only good thing was mcavoy imo i think he fitted the role angelina was there just for the label but the plot was so weak and absurd that not even her legs could save it i wont get at all into the clichs son against father but i would like to comment that the extermination of the arch villain is presented along the ending title sequence as something trivialsome scenes were shot in prague the fraternity castlefactory ones the art director explained the trouble they went into covering the european type brickwalls with rubber american type ones the attention to little details in the cgi creation of backgrounds as a graphic designer im always fascinated by these things but this time i felt so sorry for the art crue they got into all this detail chase for a movie that had not the most basic thing a sound storyline,fantasy
seriously i dont get the grade this movie got here 70 when this review is written aside from the really good special effects this movie lacks any sense the script is awful and the plot just makes one wonder if its worth watching all the way thoughjames mcavoy acting level in this movie is horrible true you can blame the script or you could just assume they drag each other down i figured than since ive already spent an hour and a half that i will never get back i should spend another 5 minutes to write these lines  maybe you can save this time doing something else,fantasy
the film starts with the central character conducting an inner monologue documenting the tedium of his life in some parts this contained aspects that the everyday nobody could relate to and had some funny parts to it as this continues i am struck with an overwhelming sense of deja vu the format and content draws a remarkable resemblance to that of ed nortons character in fight club the feeling of not realising ones full potential the anxiety of day to day living and even a reference to the materialistic values of our society the characters even look similar small weedy and generally unnoticeable the difference between these two portrayals is executes it with less charm subtlety and originalitythe unique selling point of this movie is the characters ability to bend bullets is somewhat milked we already understood this was a factor in the trailer but we are still subjected to multiple scenes of unnecessary shooting round corners up down sideways and even full circle what seems to be quite a complex and practised technique is simply picked up by the central character by the cunning use of a montagethe main premise is introduced about halfway through the film the questions we have about this fraternity why how are answered when morgan freeman briefs the viewer and lead role on the mystical and hysterical machine the loom of fate morgan freemans serious tone during this scene could only add to the comedy of the foundation of the film hence why this film i find was almost a comedyi found that none of the characters struck me with any awe empathy or any interest the central role is contrived and unoriginal i did not feel inclined to will him to victory or any sense of justice when his demons were fought and his battles won the character portrayed by morgan freeman was flat and i was given no real clue as to his motivations or overall goals lastly fox jolie although i can kind of see what they were trying to get at the sexy aloof and complicated assassin i felt too distanced from her and quickly lost interest in any story she might want to tellthis however is an action movie and we almost expect a few plot holes and whatnot but in this movie they are just so numerous that at times it is jarring example when the main character falls into a ravine in europe he is suddenly transported back to america in the very next scene fit and well thanks to their invention that has eluded medical professionals a waxy bath we are forced to believe that he was saved and while still unconscious brought back to america assumably in a plane through customs without a passport bleeding by someone that wasnt even present at the time overall this was one of the worst movies i have seen this year and i could rant for pages regarding the various flaws and ridiculousness of the entire ordeal however i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a good sense of humour,fantasy
this movie makes no sense holy sht is it funi dont read graphic novels i generally dont like movies made from graphic novels or comic bookshowever i have a powerful ability to suspend disbelief and this is the greatest suspend disbelieve movie of 2008angelina jolie is named  wait for it  fox with a twist of the wrist bullets fly around corners a fraternity of assassins that is a thousand years old has discovered binary code total losers are really heirs to the fraternity by being constantly beat up your assassination instincts will emerge and you can shoot down bullets aimed at you with your own bullet and you can enlist an army of exploding rats as your personal army and the best way to invade the castle of your enemy is to run in and grab the guns dropped by people you have just shotwhats not to lovei like it that action movies are moving into absurd territory people might see themselves in the godfather nobody will see themselves in unless they are insane,fantasy
nowadays people cant tell the difference between good and evil a movie with no human value no lessons and nothing good where a group of assassins appear as a brotherhood of angels on divine missiondifficult to understand how an actress like angelina jolie who portrays herself as icon and image of kindness to the world or morgan freeman who has even played god to lend themselves to play on a twisted mind screenplay where violence and foul language is part of every sceneclearly this proves that not everything that comes from hollywood is good time and money wasted on an evil twisted and sick story,fantasy
leave your brains at the door you wont be needing them though that isnt necessarily a bad thing for thoses tired of blockbusters pretending to be otherwise prince caspian grindhouse is a true breath of fresh air a action film that knows its an action film and doesnt pretend to be anything more or anything less though a great cast and a tired but still superb plot help but as far as action goes this is some of the most fluent and nail biting action ive seen since the matrix all the way back in 1999its unlikely action hero james mcavoy who shines brighter than anybody else though slightly irritating at the start of the movie one his kickass side develops he is every iota the james bourne beta we were looking for though credit must go to the suburb morgan freeman and the shimmering angelina jolie who both sweep away the competition as some of the greatest action movie characters to date though may lack the smarts of casino royal of the bourne identity it very easily makes up for all of that which is lost simply because of its outstanding action sequences is never dull and never boring and only ever silly but who really cares about that night watch director timur bekmambetov helms his first englishlanguage feature film with this bigscreen adaptation of mark millars actionpacked graphic novel wesley gibson james mcavoy is a cubedwelling hypochondriac whose uneventful life has become a mundane blur of terminal boredom repeatedly humiliated by his boss and constantly cuckolded by his cheating girlfriend weakling wes seems to be living right down to everyones expectations that he would never amount to anything in life however upon discovering that the father he never knew has been brutally murdered the spineless clockpunching pushover is recruited into a secret society of assassins known as the fraternityduring the course of his training the man who was once an officebound wimp develops lightningfast reflexes and superhuman dexterity courtesy of his skilled mentor fox angelina jolie upon completing his training wes is assigned the task of dealing out death to the mythological fates who possess the ability to alter the lifelines of mortal menjolie is all wolf kohleyed and coldblooded but for all her lethal skills and dropdead physique theres something approachable about her she plays fox with a hint of sardonic remove and a touch of downtoearth grit as if this pumpedup killing machine hasnt forgotten what its like to be one of the girls she puts her cat suit on one leg at a timeall in all i thoroughly enjoyed and it ranking just behind cloverfield as one of the greatest action flick of 2008 with only minor stumbles glides through its fluent action sequences with no problem what so ever though nonof us like that part where morgan freeman swears hes too nice for sht like that,fantasy
this movie is one of the best films ive seen since the matrix it is a work of fiction not intended to be realistic the story is compelling the cinematography is excellent its very violent and there are a lot of curse words but it really makes you think this film is one of the first in a long time to be really entertaining but at the same time forces you to be introspective this is not a film for the simple minded this is a film for people who love great film and can appreciate the inter workings of film making is a masterpiece that forces you to appreciate life in a way that has never been done before it is not a feelgood movie it is an awesome movie,fantasy
is steeped in nihilistic geek culture a comic based movie but being reworked from the source and now breaks into the hollywood mainstream by a relatively unknown director timur bekmambetov with influences from varied movies matrix equilibrium fight club is a symphony of snazzy violence which ejects a spectacle of awesomeness the movie starts of with a man who gets setup from the getgo into a decoy situation and being killed by another named cross we now enter into our protagonists life wesley james mcavoy an insignificant office drone who gets panic attacks and is basically a living doormat one day wesley out to purchase some drugs gets saved by a mysterious assassin fox angelina jolie from the mysterious killer cross after saving his life from the killer she takes him to the fraternity part of an ancient cabal of killers that keep the world in balance which is a secret society of assassins sloan morgan freeman explains to wesley that his father was one of the worlds greatest assassins until cross killed him sloan also informs him that his panic attacks are nothing more than a heighten sense of state and it is an ability that very few people have but that his father had too wesley refuses to believe and returns to his regular life but not long before he begins to believe we learn further that the fraternity has descended from a medieval guild of weavers the giant loom of fate somehow encoding their targets into pieces of cloth wesley joins the fraternity and through some grueling initiations and intense training maneuvers he eventually hones his skillwhile the action sequences are phenomenal primarily because they defy the laws of physics its not really a bad thing per se since the previews do clearly show exactly what the movie is about the direction is actually good for hollywood rookie as there are virtually no dead spots and the pacing flows along with the story there is suspense which is crisp throughout despite the directors constant flirtations with ongoing kinetic frenzywith the plot and concept derived from a graphic novel the story element is intriguing enough as there are a series of twist and turns the keep the story interesting regardless however way you may assess it the style and execution is pretty much spot on there are many funny moments and some smart dialogue mixed in as well the performance by angelina jolie was decent and you cannot deny that her screen presence is stunning even though a few more pounds of flesh on her would have made her a knockout james seems to be shooin as an alister as he has demonstrated his arthouse gig and now vying for the major action leagues of hollywood he was a dynamite central performance morgan freeman is real good at playing these badass characters and his interpretation of sloan was nothing short of brilliantbursts with incredible energy right from the start with wall to wall kinetic action and hyperspeed effects a comic trash nonetheless but a smacking tasty relish this is with a vibrant sensory feast and hardhitting orgasmic pleasure is desirously fun,fantasy
i just got back from seeing and it was amazing it was a lot of fun a really great popcorn flick im not going to waste time explaining the story because you can just read a synopsis it was filled with action and some dark humor what surprised me was that it was a pretty funny movie i enjoyed wesleys sarcastic narration especiallythe action was ridiculous of course if youre not a fan of violent films then you wont like this one it is a really blood shootemup but loads of fun the action sequences are ridiculous and had people in the theater flipping out and even standing up clapping the humor was great too i thought that all the actors did a good job as well james mcavoy was great as wesley morgan freeman as sloan and angelina jolie as fox if all the action and humor still dont make you want to see this movie angelina jolie will brad pitt is a lucky man i dont want to reveal anything too great but she has the best booty ever put on screen when this movie comes out on dvd i will be putting my pause button to great useall in all it was a load of fun tons of action some great humor and ridiculously hot angelina jolie any fan of action films has to check this out because they are in for a thrill ride doesnt disappoint and will keep you thoroughly entertained until the dark knight i highly recommend it,fantasy
wellthe movie is good in terms of action adrenaline storyline and actors but something i havent see in the reviews is that the movie has no moralfor those people that like a meaning in moviesstories well i dont recommend it if you just want to see an action film without care for the story or anything but to be tight on the seat well see it youll have a good timewhen the movie end i have the feeling that i am crap meaningless human destined to be a murderer and to forget everything i learn in school church and family goal does not justify the means el fin no justifica los medios,fantasy
i have to say this is the best summer movie of 2008 yet from the sadistic humor to the explosive affects makes this movie a must see in theaters joliet is hotter than ever and reminds me of her days as laura croftthe actor of wesley gibson was also very good  he set the tone for the whole moviethe special effects were amazing making this like the matrix but with a whole lot of humor thrown inall in all thats what makes this  on my list the best 2008 summer movie if the year yet,fantasy
ridiculously overthetop featuring dull performances and ludicrous action sequences taken to such impossible extremes that they lose any value they might otherwise have wraps up with a massive action sequence that looks like a liveaction version of itchy  scratchythough even someone making that cartoon would have stopped themselves when things looked like they were getting too unbelievable funnier than any deliberate comedy this year filled with overwrought comicbook fanboy angst and brimming with absurd action will be forgotten in theaters before ive finished typing this review and really doesnt merit another line of commentary,fantasy
this is an example of unconstrained brutal movie making at its worst technically excellent but that is routine now as i watched it at a friends homerandomly selected i might add my mind was almost immediately revusled at which time i switched to analytical mode in my opinion this movie is one of many recently made of the same genre that glorifies brutality and savagery i was literally stunned at the level of violence graphically portrayed and yet we wonder about the likes of columbine and other merciless real life killings what could be an inspiration i wonder movies like this make such actions in real life to appear normal and so some act it out many are becoming morally decrepit and violence numbed individuals its only a movie some say yes but humans learn from watching especially young people god help us avoid this movie at all costs,fantasy
good god on mighty if i can encourage anyone not to go to see this movie i will be happy without doubt one of the worst moves i have seen recently zero plot zero acting all mashed together with the most ridiculous special effects you have ever seeni think that the director decided that it would be better to replace the cast with wooden dolls to get a more authentic performance because the acting was direis there any possibility i can give this movie minus points in short 2 hours of my life i am never getting back bad bad oh just so bad,fantasy
this is a james bond batman speed combination movie it tries to be sophisticated like bourne and fails it tries to be over the top like tarantino and fails there tooyet if you like action you should go see it dont worry about the 67 rating people i think have been too critical its enjoyableand you get to see angelina jolie i am not her fan i think she was like 35 when this movie came out yet she is somehow nicer than a beautiful 18 yr old she is an intriguing actress and it was fun watching hercheers,fantasy
i would rate it 1 but angelina jolie alone gets another point the movie lacks almost everything except special effects and clichs superb casting but doesnt work for this movie at all i try and i try but i cant get into this movie its even worse than daredevil in my opinion considering its a 2008 movie of course i think its just pleasing for the lame people that can connect with the main character and hope that their low empty life would turn into a world saving super sexy chick banging lifejust so you know i registered after 6 years of reading reviews here after seeing that this movie got such a good score on rt  this movie deserves no more than a 25 in my opinion what is wrong with people  or is it just the angelina effect the casting looks perfect just not for this movie i watched it twice trying to understand why people would rate it so high still a mystery to me a part from the great effort by angelina to make this movie worth watchinglot of money and effects wasted on an lame plot the tone is changing from sequence to sequence sometimes made me think of daredevil surely not matrix which is 10 times more believable than this in all aspects i think the only thing that could explain such a high score is that it makes lame people think they can achieve extraordinary things overnight and become special just because they can endure pain repeatedly a normal guy would have died 5 times just during the first week of training makes the nolife and midclass guy think he can save the world and get a chance with the sexiest girl alive i think thats about it for the value of this movie making some guys feel less like garbage and more confident in miracles happening for me it was just a big waste of time twice id rather watch the horrible series heroes than this the only feeling i got watching this was feeling sorry for morgan freeman and angelina jolie even though she does her best with the movies materialpointless movie doesnt get above ground level,fantasy
the only reason i put this stinker on was that i saw thomas kretschmann while flipping through the cable channels the story centers around a hangdog office worker who suddenly gets kidnapped by assassins who tell him his father was one of the best so they are going to train him to be an assassin these guys and girls really put the ass in assassin  twice i was quite disappointed as the movie got more and more ridiculous jolie was so bad worse than usual i mean that i was almost embarrassed for her im sure she laughed all the way to the bank i have no idea why kretschmann was in this film  hes had so much work since the pianist that i can hardly believe he needs the money that badly i can say the same for morgan freeman and terence stamp too bad i like mcavoy but with such a ridiculous story line horrible writing and some truly wooden performances he never had a chance,fantasy
i must admit i did read the comments on imdb before i watched this movie so i wasnt entirely shocked but it still had a few surprises i wouldnt have said watching this movie was a waste of an hour and a half because it makes me savour good movies all the more this thing is absolute crap on a crust after watching a movie like shawshank redemption or se7en you sort of wonder if morgan freeman is trying to commit suicide with this thing he is a favourite actor of mine but gives a less than stellar performance in this one as for angelina jolie she was about usual and she doesnt add any sex appeal to the movie in the slightest sense actually she looked down right nasty as for mcavoy he had a few moments of redemption but very few the actual storyline is so so weak the loom of fate sounds more like a piece of toast shaped like jeasus to me and bending bullets come on i think if your a 13 year old nerd and play a lot of computer games this will be a good one for you if you are not then avoid it like the plague,fantasy
when this was released way back in june i had every intention of spending my hard earned money and seeing it at the cinema but for one reason or another i ended up missing out so 5 months and one huge christmas advertising campaign later i picked up the dvd and i was not disappointed with the amount of comic book movie makeovers occurring on a monthly basis this adaption of mark millars graphic novel series could well have fallen by the way side but thanks to some fantastic action sequences and stellar performances by jolie mcavoy and morgan freeman this summer blockbuster attempt really impressed me the plot is very spidermanesquire and does enough to sustain interest throughout moreover it leaves a certain degree of suspense at the end so im sure we can expect a sequel for 20092010 definitely worth the purchase if only to stare at jolie for an hour and a half,fantasy
i really was expecting a lot more from timur bekmambetov adaptation of mark millar comic book top cow 2003the first 5 minutes of the movie are good but all the sudden the script starts changing from the originalturning the bad guys into good guyswith heart and feelingschanging the whole concept from the comic bookif you have read the mini series dont bother to watch the movie it has nothing to do with the original story no sadistic killers no super villains no super powers nor super weapons no parallel universes lets wait for the watchmen with the fingers crossed,fantasy
the movie is about a young man who finds out that his long lost father is an assassin who is killed and teams up his organisation to avenge him anyway let me get to the point this movie is absolutely horrible the only way i understood the story is by reading it not on the screenplay of the movie the first half was so unacceptably bad that i felt like im in a car diving with no destination at the start there was a birthday in an office then all of a sudden there was a useless sex scene there were so many stupid and composite scenes and the filmmakers expect you to suddenly change your mood which is beyond irritating the action was daft  unrealistic eg bullets that goes where you want them to go and shooting a bullet before it hitsthe second half got a bit interesting and was going well but the ending was so bad that it just ruined the second half which was the only good part of the film personally i think that the beginning and the ending are the most important scenes of any movie because of the first and last impression and the beginning and the ending were the worst scenes of there where also some questions that are left unansweredoverall i to see this film when i seen the trailer and it totally turned out to be an unmovie,fantasy
there are too many things wrong in this movie to detail each and everyone here ill try to cover the worst plot not that much of a plot the special powers of the members of the frat is never fully explored just the statement of high adrenaline rush and high reaction time the orders to kill sent by an unnamed spiritual entity in binary code on the weaving of a piece of cloth well it really exists to allow sloan to tamper with the orders and profit with some kills at least thats what is hinted in the movie physics bending bullet trajectories totally unbelievable and absurd jumping from one building to the roof of another if the character had a cape a superhero suit and an extraterrestrial ancestry i might had bought that gore just excessive not really necessary to show that much blood and body parts flying around the molar in one of the first scenes was really too much on the other hand i really went to see the movie just to see angelina jolie not the greatest actress in the world no even close but one of the sexiest persons in the movie industry but not even her presence could rise the rating above 3 stars special effects are well done but without a good plot they are like a frame with no painting in it in the end a poor experience not really worth the us 85 of the ticket better wait for it to come on cable and spend the money on a pizza,fantasy
when i went in to see i had no idea what i was going to get from it and i was worried that it would be another jumper however i found the film to be brilliant apart from flashbacks that take a second or two for you to know just when it was meant to take place i found myself enjoying every part of the film something that hasnt happened in a long time the action scenes are well put together and not as over the top as other films try to make themthere was enough chemistry between james mcavoy and angelina joile for them to fit well on screen together as appear more then comfortable with each otherpeople are saying that the film isnt believable but they fail to see that nothing about it was meant to be this is the first film in over a year that i would happily go back and see again and again it easily tops any other action film out in the past eighteen months and perhaps longer,fantasy
ok all i have to say is that its an amazingly good moviei agree and just become my favourite movie yet of 2008if you are a fanatic of actionmovies then you wouldnt like to miss this one who hasnt yet watched a matrix movie my grandmum yes she hasthis movie has all action lovers dream of great action amazing story and unbelievable special effects  i really mean itand angelina joelly is just amazing on that movie a lot of credit to her also for james mcavoy who had to change his scottish accent to a perfect american accent credit to morgan freeman as well and other excellent actors10 out of 10  for special effects 10 out of 10  for camera angles and rotations 10 out of 10  for film locations 9 out of 10  for story telling 10 out of 10  for actors acting 8 out of 10  for background acting 4 out of 10  for realisticness in real life vs in movie 5 out of 10  for possibility in real life vs in movie 10 out of 10  for vehicles used 9 out of 10  for lovesexactionsuspancetotal 85this is what i think it can vary with each individual you gotta watch it,fantasy
contains spoilers i really couldnt believe this filmi dont mean i couldnt believe that a young guy could be plucked from his boring life and trained to be a super assassini dont mean that i couldnt believe that by channelling adrenalin he is able to alter his perception of time to dodge or catch bullets is able to jump onto moving trains and is even able to shoot around cornerswhat i couldnt believe is that major film studios still insult their viewing audience with awful scripts such as thisdespite all the slomo digital effects this film had no characters you could empathise with lousy dialogue no humour and no sense of dramai dont understand why the studios would be prepared to pay many millions of dollars for top hollywood stars and special effects when the script is so shoddythey are presumably quite happy that the film has made a lot of money but it cost a lot and could have made even more if it was truly involving and entertainingsurely the cost of writing a decent script for this would have been negligible in comparison to the overall cost of this filmsam raimis spiderman films show how you can portray comic book characters with plenty of action but also sympathetic characters and humour this surely greatly broadens the appeal of the filmsi bought the 3 spiderman films i have all the superman and batman films etc like this film they all stretch credibility but have the added advantage of good scripts and humour well maybe not superman ivtheres no way i would buy this tripe on dvd so theyve lost out on an additional 15 from mewhy did they base this on the comic book when it is such a departure from the storyline anyway why did the publishers let them the studio should revisit the accounts for this film in a year and see how much net profit the dark knight and iron man have made with additional cinema tickets dvd and bluray sales etc and think strongly about sending the chimps with typewriters back to the zoo,fantasy
where to begin the only bad thing i can say about this movie was that the beginning dragged on just little but i understand why the director did he did it to set everything up but would have been better to just get right into itcasting was perfect james mcavoy did a great job with his character he played the vulnerable geek well in the beginning and was pretty convincing as an action star to be honestangelina other than all of the tattoos she was smoking put a gun in her hand she gets hotter i enjoyed her performance this is what this woman was made to do it was nice to see morgan freeman step outside the box a little and play the villainthe other supporting characters were pretty good other than the other assassins who really didnt do much but stand around when on screen to be honest i thought this would be a break out role for common but he said i think all of about 3 sentences or had one word answersthe action in this movie i have to admit was so unrealistic it was insane but when i was watching the movie all i was thinking was who was the person that thought all this stuff up best scene in the movies were to the two car chase sequences the train sequence was alright and the ending since i dont want to give it away was pretty good as wellthere is a plot twist in the movie to be honest with you i totally did not see coming i usually see these things before it happens but i was rather entertain since i didnt see this plot comingfor me the movie is a must see,fantasy
my god this is a male fantasy come true youre in a dead end office job then in a supermarket the ever seductive angelina jolie is literally right behind you then youre in a crazy shoot outcar chase soon after youre told you dad was a highly trained killer and you have over three million dollars in your bank account then you tell your pathetic bully of a boss some painful home truths and kick your two faced best best friends arse you then learn to become a highly trained killer and member of the fraternity if only this was my life if only okay its a shameful rip off of the matrix but hey in a world of wussy pg13 action movies this is a rare find plus their is a killer twist,fantasy
for anyone looking for an extremely gory actionfilled movie with plot twists go seefor anyone who doesnt like gore cussing or takes comicbook based movies too seriously dont see this movieim just surprised by most of the comments on how the movie is so poor the most common reason people didnt like the movie based on the comments here on imdb is that the movie isnt realistic the movie is based on a comicbook did this movie ever seem like it was trying to apply all the rules of real life physics since those same people seem to always use the classic americans are dumbed down because of entertainment like this then explain why youre so dumbed down you couldnt notice in the previews that there were supernatural events occurring in the trailer for the movie or how about 5 minutes into the movie when a guy jumps across from one building to another did you think this was a documentary you should have left at that point in the movie if you were going to take the movie that seriousit just seems strange to me that people complained about the overthetop violence in the preview it shows a curving bullet in slowmotion what did you expect to happen when the bullet hits the person in the head everyone also knew before seeing the movie that it was about assassins what do assassins do they kill people this is the first time ive ever commented on a movie and ive been reading reviews and trivial facts on this site for over two years i hope at least one person who claims that the only people who like this movie are idiots reads this i guarantee they are the type of people who complain about everything dont enjoy life and are just frustrated all the time id rather not be in that boat do the anxiety pills he takes in the movie look familiar to you,fantasy
i personally value this for what it clearly is a mindless action flick filled with violent and overdone scenesbut yet a movie that if you actually manage to disconnect your pseudointellectual mindset for a while does what it is supposed to do entertainand apart from how immorally incorrect this movie might be for some with all the violence and killing without a good reason i still believe that it delivers a very clear message at the end and one that i just cant find anything wrong with get yourself together and do something about your life if you arent happy with it in other words put all the crap aside dont think about it too much because this isnt what youre supposed to do not when you watch or critique this movie and just do itso what can i say this movie just delivered what it was supposed to deliver in my opinion and i would dare to think that im being a hypocrite if i said that it had delusions of grandeur or compared it to matrix or shootem up when it clearly doesnt aspire to have the plot of the first one nor the extreme absurdity in my opinion at least it doesnt of the second one,fantasy
i have to say that this film was exactly what i expected it to be an out an out action fest over the top physics defying unbelievable escapismhad i been expecting a clever film with a complex plot etc then i would have given it 2 or 3 out of 10 but the previews trailers and hype prior to its release made no bones about what kind of movie this wasrecommended for anyone who likes to be swept along by bullet time and over the top action sequences not recommended for anyone who likes to over analyse films to the nth degree and pick fault with unrealistic parts or the fact that things are physically impossible in the real world,fantasy
many say that this movie is matrix reloaded but with much more humor im sorry to say that despite the fact that i usually am very tolerant with bad movies and try to have a good time even if they dont appeal to me that much this time i just couldnt i just sat there for 90100 minutes and wondered what was in james mcavoys mind when he accepted to act in it i mean my god i never ever felt that insulted in my entire life the whole film is just a big fat clich filled with come on how stupid do they think i am to buy this scenes now seriously i thought matrix really had a base on which to build the rest of the plot a world of its own in which you didnt find it awkward for all those things to happen in here i just couldnt wait for the movie to be over and recover myself from this horrible experience everything in it either didnt make any sense or it was extremely predictable,fantasy
what a load of hogwash its as if the matrix got mixed with looney toons and the whole concoction was directed by someone trying to imitate john woo while high on crystal methits about an organization of assassins who can do almost anything but yet they require a nobody who works as an office drone their big reveal reason for wanting him to join doesnt even make that much sense cos theyre supposed to be so well trained in the first place plus they can manage to do the most impossible stunts in the world as if they all had formal training at cirque du soleil and can kill any target at anytime but yet theyre so dumb they cant think for themselves cos they all seem to get taken by surprise for the final twist2 awesome action setpieces one involving a car and a bus and the other involving a train falling of a suspension bridge over a canyon managed to save me from gouging out my eyes and my disappointment in morgan freeman is growing as he was one of my fave actors but seems to be doing anything for money these days edison the contract wtf and as for angelina looking nothing like her former voluptuous self and seeming kinda sickly is distractingly nauseating james mcavoy does a halfway decent job for the first 30 minutes until he turns into the spawn of neo from previously mentioned matrix its made oodles of cash at the box office though so of course the sequel is a lock pity,fantasy
heres a cool film that sadly wont make it into my dvd collection when it gets released why well because i already have it admittedly my version has a different name different actors and despite being even more fantastical than this one is far less insulting to my intelligence what is this dvd i hear you cry well its the matrixto say borrows a few elements from the matrix would be like saying that the white settlers borrowed some land from the native americans the characters situations and effects are all there with only the thinnest of disguises ie name changes and rationale to distinguish themand lets think about the rationaleadrenaline in sufficiently large doses can make you perform superhuman feats like leaping between tall buildings in a single bound and with minimal additional training  erbeating you can make bullets curl around things mcavoys terrible attempt at an american accent jolies innaterubberinessand a hundred and one other annoying things all grate on your nerves after a surprisingly short while add in the ridiculous overthetop action sequences and physics what physics mentality and the whole thing just begins to stink like a weekold kippertarget audience im really at a loss to think who might find this entertaining for more than a few seconds so ill be kind and suggest that only those desperate to plumb the depths of movie hell watch this for everyone else dig out your matrix copy its less unbelievable,fantasy
when i first heard of this movie i thought it might be an interesting take on the actiongenre and with freeman and jolie in the cast it reinforced my thoughtstaking a pile of assassins with the ability to dodge bullets shoot wings off of flies jump from scraper to scraper and much much more is surely to make one hell of an actionflicksadly this couldnt be farther from the truth the script must have been written down by a 12yearold who must have been retarded too all the action gets lost in the infantile mood and exaggerated abilities which arent explained with more than 5 wordsthe movie is a mess and freeman who i think is a well performing actor cant even remotely hide the bad writing or the irretrievable lame execution of this moviei am mostly disappointed with this movie and 4 stars equals very generous watch it if it doesnt take more than jolie with a tattoo and freeman in a suit to maintain your interest,fantasy
even if all belief is suspended watching this movie its still one of the worst movies i have ever seen its just so dumb the storyline was ridiculous the action was cgi laden nonsense in all honesty i was in tears of laughter at times through how awful the experience was thismovie is for guys who are obsessed with action computer games and thats about it anyone who wants a good movie save your money because this one aint it did anyone else notice the ending was stolen from the korn music video freak on a leash with the camera following the slow motion bullet going through people and donuts and cups etc the story was also ripped from the murky depths of the matrix sequels with complicated nonsense and slow motion gunshot scenes seriously at one point i got up and left for the bathroom and 2 minutes later i come back and a million mice are running about with watches on or bombsdont ask i didnt even care anymore to find out how peanut butter enticed a million vermon it was gratuitous gore blood every where with no real reason everyone being shot in the brain and the action scenes were stupid at one point mcavoy flips his car over this other car and in the air he points his gun at a random guy it was apparently his destiny to kill then before shooting him he declares im sooooory the direction in this movie was awful it seemed like random action set pieces glued together with no flow no coherence it was a muddy mess what was angelina jolies purpose in this movie someone tell me all she did was beat up james mcavoy a lot ride about on the tops of speeding trains like she was walking on a pavement in downtown la james mcavoiy i went into the movie liking him midway through i him to get shot lets try and make sense of the storyline all i can give you is a list of key words because the story was so chaotic horribly written and made such little sense that its beyond me to link it together binary fraternity assassins destiny loom apparently mcvoy goes from a nervous office worker to a monster assassin when a trip to the pharmacy has jolie meet him he avoids getting shot he gets enrolled in an assassins fraternity he gets beaten up in training a montage few minutes later and he has a 6pack and ready to avenge his fathers death then we get involved in his training and make sense of some sort of loom of destiny dont ask me how a sewing kit has anything to do with assassins but even that isnt the most ridiculous thing i had to make sense of we go from riding around in trains in chicago to some castle somewhere some monastery somewhere some mountains somewhere i have no idea where within a click of a finger it was like bewitched with a twitch of their nose and a click of their finger they are in completely different countries there is some sort of incoherent twist where mcavoy ends up shooting his dad and the frat mcavoy killed from the start in fact they their own members killed from the start which made this film completely pointless there was some other matrix style binary codes which i wont even attempt to explain now onto the curvy bullets how utterly stupid not only were they curvy they could be made with a twist of your arm and a bullet can wipe out a whole circle of the frat then yourself at the end in a perfect circle which angeline jolie illustrates at the end kinda like a boomerang my only wish is she didnt include mcavoy in the circle and did it in the first minute of the movie so i didnt have to endure over 2 hours of a gamers wet dream,fantasy
lets think about this james mcavoy has done many different genres of films and this is his first steps into action films looking from the trailer he also does a good job of acting a believable american character however despite this and the intense action sequences of the film ended up being a muddled mediocre film that had a lot of potentialthe plot runs around a guy named wesley gibson he has a pathetic life working under a boss that abuses him girlfriend that is cheating on him with his best friend and so on one day fox invites him to the fraternity which is a group of super assassins he goes through rigorous training to attain skills which his father once had prior to being killedthe one obvious positive point about this movie are the action sequences it is slick stylized and bloody similar to shoot em up the film crams one crazy stunt after another pumping the adrenaline to the viewer it is very fun to watch and very well choreographedsimilarly the film puts a big emphasis on slow motion however this tends to be a hit or miss making the film look cool or downright silly scenes where the viewer see a bullet fly through space a la matrix are very well done however there are also scenes where you hear characters speaking in slow motion that adds nothing but sillinessthe biggest problem with the movie is its pacing it spends the first hour or so showing the introduction of the characters and gibsons training in the fraternity the next hour presents a plot twist and the development to the final showdown you will notice that this movie tends to focus on the story more than the action similarly after the twist it explain other aspects of the story even though you spent another chunk of time listening to the development of the characters earlier on with a film that has a two hour runtime it is rather disappointinganother mixed aspect of this film is the humor with over the top action and stunt sequences the film is riddled with silly dialogues and events when the film wants you to take the films story seriously you cant help but to wonder if the dialogue is intentionally trying to be funny or notoverall can be described as a action flick that contain slick and violent action but suffers from poor pacing and structure despite its big potential it felt like it fell down a little bit,fantasy
what a pity that actors as good as james mcavoy and morgan freeman can allow themselves to be degraded by such pathetic nonsense as i went with my sister who i havent seen for a couple of years after this film i felt embarrassed that after this long time apart i ended up taking her to this turkey i stayed to the end but was crawling in my chair from about 50 of the way through the film wanting to get out of there i didnt leave because i didnt want to spoil it for my sister  little did i know that she was desperate to get out of there too i dont think ill have the hide to ever suggest we see a film togetherthis dog of a film trawls new depths whereas the matrix hit the mark the first one that is  the second and third ones were dreadful to compare the matrix with is like comparing dog food with a top meal at maxims in paris the two films are about as far apart in terms of entertainment and excellence as its possible to be save your money  dont see this film it will leave a very bad taste in your mouth for a long time to come,fantasy
at the beginning a little bit funny but than comes all that crap with superheroes im not against them but it seems that producers found the easiest way of getting money by creating the guys able to look through playboy hotties dress and combining abilities of batspiderx and other mans all together but no actual prehistory not in the beginning and not in the end dont count the phrases like for thousand years exists fraternity ok i understand that the strike of screenplay writers is a big problem  but before this movie i didnt realize how big it can be named matrix the strike  office worker superhero abilities tricks with bulletsa lot of action and thats it its a very good trailer but not the movie  where are the dialogs the training part is a parody on batman the beginning and other such movies the storyline is a combination of story lines of brazilian soap operas and cheap action moviesa lot of big stars but whats for they a not speaking and not acting jolie looks really ill  please give her that burger james mcavoy is not bad but he wont get oscar for that,fantasy
technically excellent especially the effects but profoundly senseless violent disturbing and saddening i t is not the nra that should be blamed for senseless killing by desperate and vengeful losers but rather hollywood and movies like this one the answer to a sense of inferiority and a hopeless life is to get a gun acquire power through it and become a supperassassin above any law if you feel worthless and hopeless follow wesleys example you will have power money and all the sex you want you will be the manby the way dont trust anyone the world is corrupt and friends will doublecross you any time you will have to kill your own father in the process but you will eventually be free of all thatthe last words of the movie are especially disturbing what have you done lately do you have a boss you hate do you have a girlfriend that cheats on you do you have a colleague who uses you get a gun and turn your life aroundi think it is time that we put some limits on the irresponsible and greed driven hollywood and introduce some kind of code to comply with,fantasy
ive just seen this movie and i think it isnt bad its idiotic it begins unexpectedly good with one of the most breathtaking scenes i have ever seen in an action movie and thats it from then till the end is just a stupid boring story and the end oh yes the end you would believe it wants to get back to you from the good beginning the characters you would believe they are from a comedy a bad one angelina jolie has made a fool of herself by accepting this rolenot as big as al pacino for 80 minutes but quite enough somebody said in a comment before that some of his friends compared this movie to fight club its like comparing a destruction derby car with a brand new lamborgini my opinion dont lose a minute more on this junk,fantasy

if you go into expecting lifeaffirming brilliance you will be disappointed but if you go in expecting an adrenalinefuelled thrill ride you should come out at least fairly contented the film is apparently based on some comic book and is directed by timur bekmambetov a name some may recognise as the director behind russian vampire film night watch and its sequel the film is style over substance in a big way although it does at least attempt to have some substance by way of the basic idea of a normal man living a boring life being given the chance to fulfil his destiny by way of a much more exciting life as a professional assassin his boring life is thrown into turmoil one day when he meets the sexy fox and after being saved from a hitman himself he is recruited into a group of assassins known as the fraternity he is taught how to use his hidden super powers which include the ability to slow things down shoot bullets in a circular motion and drive rubbish cars really fast our hero then learns the reason he was brought in to the fraternity and the destiny that awaits himthe film takes on a very mtv style and the action is continually paused overloaded with cgi andor quickly edited things like this usually annoy me and with this film it does start to grate after a while but the director actually uses these tricks fairly well particularly in the first twenty minutes or so which is a credit to him and the film once the plot kicks into action we basically get treated to one action sequence after another and calling them over the top would be a gross understatement most of the things that happen in this film are completely ridiculous but it soon becomes obvious that the film is not meant to be taken seriously and its better to sit back and enjoy the ride the plot itself has a number of holes and doesnt make complete sense when you think about it but again leaving your brain at the door is highly recommended theres a couple of twists and turns along the way to keep the story interesting and although the ending is not completely unexpected it wraps things up nicely and overall if youre looking for a film to entertain and not be too taxing you could do worse than,fantasy
ill start off by saying i was not expecting this movie to be as good as id like but i was at least expecting it to be decent sadly that was not the case in the least for a comic movie it had surprisingly little to do with the series it was based on about the only things that survived the transfer were some character names admittedly the movie did have some cool sequences however they could not make up for the absolute lack of relevance this film has to the original storypersonally i think that this movie should have simply stuck to the story it had and not try to make it more accessible to a wider audience the comic had a brilliant ending but the movie ends up being a practice in ruining comic films reputations for accuracy if you must see this please make sure you give the book a chance to make up for the waste of time this poor poor movie is,fantasy
with pathetic nods to the matrix fight club and countless other better films this summer yawner gratuitously piles on the bodies and bloodspatter in a way only gamers can enjoy videogames make me nauseous with a flimsy plot a plethora of john woo style narrative lapses and an excess of deja vu special effects this movie barely makes it thru its predictable end morgan freeman sleepwalks thru the thin script and angelina jolie capitalizes only on her rapidly deteriorating looks btw is anybody else completely grossed out by her lips and her permanent pout is pouting all she can do please no more close ups of her horrendous lips,fantasy
this is apparently a screen version of a comic book or a video game the kind of junk thats turning the minds of young americans to mush the plot is that an everyman unhappy with his boring life gets a chance to become an over trained assassin and kill a lot of people in part to avenge the murder of his father even though he never knew the old man thats about all the plot there is here charcterization thats pretty much missing too the male star is forgettable because he is almost completely devoid of personality but he fits right in at the decaprio toby mcguire school of wimps as heroesmorgan freeman nonacts his way through the number three staring rolethat leaves the woman upon whom box office success rests angelina jolie she flashes a couple of smiles but mostly just hangs around looking enigmatic actually her part could have been played by almost anyone but she played it so she is responsible for fostering this non stop exercise in teaching kids violenceshe should be ashamed of herself she is capable of so much morei my eight bucks back when this one was over but i can never get back the two hours of my life wasted on this mess,fantasy
fluff held together by overblown action sequences though it started out interestingly enough as it progressed the plot became too far fetched for its own good once mcavoy steps into the fraternity the film throws all logic out the window and relies on action to advance the narrative that the script is halfbaked only emphasized that the somewhat creative action sequences are the only positive this film has to offer the acting was a bit better with freeman jolie and mcavoy delivering competent yet unimpressive performances in summary was another disappointing summer flick that follows the trend of relying on effects over plot,fantasy
this film was never meant to be viewed as a serious action flick in fact in quite a few parts its funny as hell so please folks enough with the comparisons to the matrix die hard bourne etcmany people complain about the immature material however did any of you truly bother reading the rating before you saw the movie yeah that is in fact an r so my advice for all those who spam the comment list with over critical remarks try to just cool down while youre watching if you then still can not succeed in at the very least partially admiring i suggest therapy or a good box of laxatives,fantasy
i didnt expect much from this movie however this was an absolutely fantastic movie with great action and a thrilling storylinewe all know it isnt possible to bend a bullet physics simply will not allow such a thing that being said i went into this movie with rather low expectations however i was blown away by the action scenes as well as the storyline i didnt expect the storyline to be so deep and thought out i was highly surprised at the end of the movie as well as being rather saddened by what transpired i wont give that part away too muchi dont recommend this movie for kids especially the younger ones as there are a couple scenes that are pretty graphic with the violence but i do recommend this movie very highly to those who love high action movies not only was i blown away by the bending of bullets but i was blown away by the main car chase that was some wicked driving by jolie plus it didnt help that shes a 25 on a scale from 1 to 10 lolmorgan freeman as usual did a fabulous job in his role angelina jolie was as hot and sexy as ever before i has never heard of james mcavoy but his performance was every bit as superb as jolies and freemansdont take my word for it make sure you see this movie for yourself,fantasy
i initially had reservations about seeing this film even as a free advance press screening because of how the trailers portrayed it scenes of angelina good actress but isnt she getting ridiculously typecast at this point in various states of dress and performing inhuman acts just didnt entice me i was very pleased as the plot progressed to see that this is merely an initial rush of smoke and mirrors and the real meat of this film doesnt really involve her muchthe plot is pretty simple so ill spin it quick basically wesley is a doormat and hates his life until an assassin introduces him to a group of assassins known as the fraternity the reason he is chosen is that he shares a bloodline with another member they train him and prepare him to be an aggressive assassin instead of a pushover i like the way this movie transitions wesleys change even though its kinda preachy a la fight club and a little too much too fast the plot moves with the sleek finesse of the fraternity members and always keeps you interested especially with twists that are much less predictable than recent films and dont require a stretch of the imagination the whole film comes together with a satisfying ending that leaves smiling while the film is a little on the testosteroneinduced macho side i dont see it being all that uninteresting to the typical female viewerjolie who plays as fox delivers another good performance one that is nearly perfected at this point because its basically recycled shes beautiful in form and stimulating to watch but i cant help but thinking that its angelina playing angelina not a character freeman as sloan delivers an intriguing performance that changes the dynamic of his acting as of late while he still commands the scene like most films he is playing an interesting new type of role that allows him to be more lighthearted in his later projects while i enjoyed freemans performance i must still give the golden star to james mcavoy who plays the lead wesley on his stellar jump into a new type of film he moves the plot with a convincing transition from doormat to bad ass and somehow keeps your eyes focused on his presence even when jolie is around as an actor i really know from a random role in swimming pool and as the faun in lion witch and the wardrobe i must say he molds into the action lead role nicely bully for him the supporting cast does a good job to back these top three many character actors youll recognize from various projects and it all comes together in a nice neat packageit wont take home any significant awards this year and it will join the many films that are chock full of beautiful babes hardcore killers and intriguing setup the difference is that your film buddy wont be able to predict more than about 13 of the twists correctly which is refreshing with a formula that has been rather overdone its a good time and doesnt disappoint for all audiences especially action junkies,fantasy
very loosely based upon mark millars comic book miniseries of the same name is the story of a white collar office worker who discovers he is actually the son of the worlds greatest assassin and sets out to avenge his fathers death with a secret fraternity of assassins who choose their targets from the loom of fate yes seriously the loom of fateawkwardly pitched somewhere between matrix and fight club without the sense of wonder of the former or the intelligence of the latter and directed by timur bekmambetov best known for 2004s night watch is difficult to judge as a film its oddly soulless inflicted by an over reliance on cgi and add direction that seems to infect the majority of modern action films yet it does have some very good set pieces and a reasonable involving storyline though the dialogue itself is a bit of a mess and the characters are never explored to their full potentialjames mcavoy one of the better actors to break through over the last few years gives a decent performance as the films protagonist wesley gibson ignoring his horrific attempt at an american accent though the support including a sleepwalking morgan freeman as fraternity leader sloan and a goingthroughthemotions angelina jolie is less successful overall doesnt fulfil its promise which it may have done had it stuck closer to millars original work but is a serviceable enough summer action film and theres certainly worse ways to spend 2 hours in the evening just dont expect anything to make you beg for a sequel though theres one on the way natch,fantasy
wow this is a movie i wont soon forget its like the film is planted in the back of my brain where it would never get out the film from beginning to the very last word is just delicious and you find yourself asking for more when its over just like a delicious meal you just ate but didnt have enough of the best slow motion effects since the matrix and the most profane characters since the departed were shown in and not to forget the most amount of violence every action fanatic would ask for as far as the story goes is a tale of a guy named wesley gibson who works as an accounts manager and basically lets others stab him in the back and treat him like crap but soon he realizes that he is destined to succeed his father who was a specially skilled assassin and worked with other assassins who call themselves as the fraternity as revelations are gradually made wesley finds out who his real enemies are and why he got tangled up in his so called destiny in the first place james mcavoy plays wesley gibson and i couldnt have asked for a better performance he was phenomenal i always enjoy his performances whether he plays a physician for a notorious tyrant in the last king of scotland or he plays half a human and half a something else as mr tumnus in the chronicles of narnia in there is no difference he is flawless at every angle and he does some awesome things in the film from curving bullets to shooting people from a mile or two or even more away or even shooting the wings off of tiny flies nevertheless he had some serious actors with him who got their shares of bullet curving jolie who plays fox and freeman who plays sloan both astonishing as always amazing chemistry throughout the movie and the actors were just awesomei would suggest a sequel for this piece of art it was brilliant and has a plot twist that turned the whole film around though a bit unrealistic yet again really cool special effects and did teach a little lesson about how we shouldnt let others step all over us and even if a sequel doesnt come out this will be a movie as i already said that wont be soon forgotten,fantasy
folks let me remind thats not pure hollywood movie actually it contains a lot of decent russian jokesfor example curved bullet mystery timur bekmambetov used to be soviet mortar soldier mortar are famous to get around walls to hit opponents due ballistic trajectory and there was a question from young keen soldier what if we put mortar down on side to hit around a corner the sergeant answer was yes its possible but soviet soldiers do not hit around the corner and you see that protagonists real father and matured wesley do not kill around the corner real heroes do not need this trick its that simple ,fantasy
indeed has it all and it is all fantastic james mcavoy draws the audience in from the very beginning with his expert performance his chemistry with jolie is unrivaled in comparison with any onscreen duo in films out this year the first ten minutes of the film were the most intriguing and visually stunning minutes to be found in the action genre be prepared for a wild ride with the fast vehicles violent escapades and emotional twists found in instead of listening to a few irrational viewers reviews check out because if youre looking for a gritty exceptional alternative to the hohum films being thrown at families during this holiday season youll want leaves nothing to be except more,fantasy
is simply one of the finest action movies i have seen in a long time it is the perfect summer action flick and might just be one of the finer summer films thus faris the story of a nobody office worker named wesley gibson wesley is a young man who is awkward and does not know how to stand up for himself and because of these things his life is a complete wreck he has an awful job with a horrendous boss and then on top of that his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best mate wesleys life just seems to be a complete waste until one night a mysterious woman named fox rescues wesley from an assassin fox takes wesley back to meet her leader and here wesley learns that she is a member of a secret fraternity of assassins at the fraternitys headquarters wesley is told that he possesses all of the powers to be in the fraternity and is coerced by the fraternitys leader to become an assassin once wesley begins his assassin training he learns that his father was an assassin as well and that he was killed by the rogue assassin cross upon learning this wesley begins to train harder in order to avenge his fatherdelivers everything i could ask for out of a great action movie tons of explosions cool fight scenes and a few new tricks that i have never seen before in an american action movie each action sequence is masterfully crafted and includes spectacular feats that are completely unrealistic but who cares its a comic book movie the film was really well directed by russian action director timur bekmambetov who utilized everything from slowmo to awesome zoomins to deliver the pulse pounding action scenes of course not only does it have plenty of action to satisfy the viewer but it also has a good story now the story is by no means thought provoking but is original unique and unlike any action film i have ever seen before the script is both funny and suspenseful managing to pull off both in a fashion that would make the kings of the action genre proud though what really surprised me about was the acting from james mcavoy who is most well known for his roles in films such as atonement and the chronicles of narnia mcavoy successfully makes the transition to action star in this film and definitely sells you this often outlandish story and makes you believe that this fraternity of super powered assassins could truly exist in our modern day worldoverall i felt that was one of the best summer films i have seen so far and that is no easy task seeing as how we have already had a terrific summer for movies up to this point the only disclaimer to put on this film is to heed the rrating it is full of blood gore bad language and some sexual material if you are offended by any of these things you should not see but if you dont mind them such as myself you will have a terrific time with this film i cant wait for this one on dvdgets a perfect 10 out of 10,fantasy
i just got back from the midnight showing managed to be bad and clever at times but the story blew balls and there were some major gaps in logic throughout the whole thing i never thought id say binary on a loom before but that basically sums up the story  its dumb but i guarantee there will be a bunch of people thatll eat it up basically its definitely worth seeing because the action is the next step up in the evolution of matrixlike action but if you start thinking the story might be getting good you can terminate that thought immediately also by the end of the movie the main character is still quite a tool,fantasy
based on comics by mark millar and jg jones which i had never heard of tells of a putupon wimp james mcavoy who discovers that he is the son of a member of a league of assassins called the fraternity who can do such amazing things as shooting bullets round corners in very short order he is trained up by fellow assassin angelina jolie on the instructions of fraternity head morgan freeman to pursue and kill the man who killed his father this involves various savage beatings for reasons which are never wholly clear and some trainee junior level assassinations based on targets identified from binary characters coded into fabric woven by an automatic loom which has been functioning for 1000 years since the fraternity was a guild of weavers i think  that bit didnt make a vast amount of senselets be honest the whole thing didnt make a whole lot of sense but maybe it wasnt meant to maybe it was meant to be a vehicle for the several eyepopping matrixstyle action set pieces put brain on hold and accept the improbable elements as they come along and youll like it just finemorgan freeman does his elder statesman bit angelina jolie does a variation on lara croft terence stamp pops in momentarily as zoned out as usual and james mcavoy proves that he can hold centre stage in an action movie as convincingly as everything else he doesthe action is great and there are some laughs too its not a classic  its far too dumb for that  but its a perfectly satisfactory popcorn movie,fantasy
as a person with anxiety i think mr mc avoy perfectly performed an anxiety stressed person in the workplace the film was rather good it fits in well with a m a l a d a p t i v e daydreamer who wishes they were somewhere else rather than the real world the film over all is good great infact personally i liked every moment of it not so much a review i guess but a personal thought of a realistic issue perfectly portrayed in a film the film was personally fun to watch mrs joli was rather fun to watch and as usual a brilliant actress as way mr freeman as i said a fun film that portrays anxiety rather well better than most films,fantasy
though completely unrealistic i loved it it was exciting it was adventurous and it gave hope to those of us who want more than a boring office job maybe one day while we are at work a beautifulhot assassin will come in to recruit ushey it could happen was suspenseful with a number of plot twists along the way it was also chock full of hot actors and actresses example the main two angelina and james make one hot duogo see this film you will not be disappointed it was oh so exciting you will be on the edge of your seat while you are jumping for joy and excitement,fantasy
is this film trying to give an underlying message does it leave a lot to the imagination of the audience letting them infer and deduce along the way do you have to listen to key dialogue events of course the answer to all of the above is no this is kick ass from front to back and if you walk in knowing theyre not trying to make a groundbreaking epic movie then you will love iti adored the over the top action stupidity and simplicity of this film the cast works relatively well the plot about on par with the cast and all in all it has got to be one to watch even if you never view it again afterwards,fantasy
this movie is a nonpretentious thrillride jolie says little and thats always a good thing mcavoy plays the dweebs transition to superhero assassin very well he was convincing in both roles oh and theres just enough silly improbability to clue you in that this movie isnt intended to be taken too seriouswell after reading some of the downers who reviewed this movie i have to say yet again why do people watch movies that they likely wont enjoy this is definitely a leave your brain at home movie just pure fun and more than a little tongueincheek in many respects it shares something of what made crank a fun movie theres no doubt that most of what is portrayed in this movie is downright impossible in the real world i see similar reviews for doomsday and it makes my blood boil some people simply dont understand the filmmakers intentions and miss the point that its just for funbasically were given the premise of an every day guy who has lost his way his job is boring his boss is simply awful one day he finds out that hes really the son of a superhuman assassin and his destiny is to fill his shoes sure theres a little hokey philosophy thrown in to tie the story together but its just a macguffin when alls told no need to enter into a sociopolitical philosophical rant about fate etcif youve had your fill for the week of weighty meaningful drama or youre just a sucker for well choreographed cgiheavy action then this is something for you if on the other hand you believe that entertainment must only contain elements of fact and only reside in a world of what is possible then stay at home dont rent it dont watch it and dont whine on imdb about the two hours of your life youll never get back  you still wont get em backall in all i enjoyed this for what it is it didnt leave me with a message and i didnt think about it afterward but sometimes thats what im looking for in my entertainment,fantasy
a pastiche of ideas cribbed from chuck palahniuk the wachowski brothers and paul the apostle marries its stolen themes and characters to a visual style ripped from  hey  david fincher and the wachowski brothers plus a little ringo lam matrix and fight club were about something though they were at least attempts at social commentary this movie is about nothing well okay its about two hours longer than not watching itthe graphic novel might be great i dont know i havent read it does that disqualify me from calling the movie a failed entertainment a feature length series of waxon waxoff montage sequences a childish pointlessly pottymouthed exercise in developmentally arrested wish fulfillment no it doesnt how many more existential hitman movies can we take and how many hit men need to die before they realize theyre always going to end up betrayed by their handlers dont they watch hitman movies this is a gun fetish movie in which a blocked barrel fails to blow up when the trigger is pulled maybe stress fracture biofeedback control was part of the training that got edited out or maybe this movies just stuuuuuuupid how many contradictions does one bad shootemup need anyway a girl who can bend bullets at 180 degrees cant shoot a guy driving a truck from right in front of him a building blows up from the inside and from the outside we see it explode  but from the inside the buildings barely damaged a father sends his son a message by shooting him and sending him to moravia so he can meet him on a train when hes standing about thirty feet away he couldnt just talk to himand if angelina jolie gets any weirder looking shes going to have to make all of her movies in motioncapture animation just to seem human,fantasy
hopelessly derivative generic action flick based on a comic book its either that or a computer game these daysits about pod worker wesley gibson played by james mcavoy of atonement and last king of scotland fame this time putting on an american accent he hates his job his life his coworkers etc then out of the blue this lush assassin angelina jolie is hauling him off into a different destiny so far so the matrix but then theres the come with me if you want to live action scene where theyre being chased by a nasty assassin and shes protecting him it also reminded me of weird science as the nerd is mooning over her tooits all a bit like hitman the difference being the story arc in hitman the assassin is a cool deadly type who learns real feelings thanks to a girl he picks up in its a loser who learns to be a cool deadly type thanks to being picked up by a girl its reversed i do prefer because the two leads are more charismatic and it has two outstanding action scenesthat said while i like mcavoy as an actor on principle im not sure he can really carry a film like this i didnt care for his us accent so far its all a bit like ewan mcgregor when he tried to break into the states he lacks the air of mystery or paradox really they may as well have cast an american actor jolie is terrific i must admit shes a real celluloid turn on and you dont get many of those these daysalthough it picks up towards the end this is a real dumb flick  i think it needed a european director to tap into its moral ambiguity i mean someone tells you to be an assassin and you just go with it also this nerd is meant to be trained up but it seems to take place within a few weeks rather than a year it has lots of visual tricks to distract from the fact that most of it is nicked from other films,fantasy
i dont usually write any comments about movies i have seen but this one is so bad i feel i have to warn others who are considering going to see it unless you like hearing the fbomb every other sentence and like seeing about 100 people get shot in the head dont waste your time on this one im used to seeing violence but the amount of carnage in this film is ridiculous in one scene the cadaver of an old lady who could be your grandmother is used for target practice and shot in the head in another scene the main character of the movie shoots a fellow assassin in the eye pushes the gun through his head and shoots at otherswhile running with the dead guy hanging from his gun give me a break this is just a couple of the many examples of how ridiculous and over the top the movie wasas far as the performances go james mcavoy has been pretty good in some others movies ive seen him in but this type of movie is not his thing he is unconvincing as a badass killer and his attempts at trying to be tough border on annoying morgan freeman is emotionless and gives little to the movie angelina jolie is decent and plays her part pretty well but that does not help with the rest of the poor castthis movie might appeal to some but i did not care for it at all my wife turned to me about 14 of the way through and said i hope this gets better because it really sucks so far it only got worse and i considered walking out a couple of times the only positive of the movie is that it had some pretty creative shots and gimmicks here and there if you want to see it wait until it is released on dvd,fantasy
with all the big names that are in this movie i expected a whole lot more than this my guess is that they were expecting it to turn out pretty bad so they got a bunch of good actors to attract the masses unfortunately i fell for it as wellthe action was good it has some pretty decent action scenes the sad part is that the best one is right at the start the one you see in the trailer the acting is decent but what do you expect with a line up like thisthe storyline is where this movie lacks big time now i dont have any problems with a good no brain action movie but this is not such a movie the director keeps trying to make the storyline important but fails horribly you can see the plot switches coming starwars anyone it will also leave you with many questions unanswered like why dont the normal rules of physics apply for some of these assassins there are some really disturbing things as well wesleys training consists of him getting beaten up stabbed and recovering in some magical substance after about 10 minutes of watching the above he suddenly is a very powerful assassin but theres more the assassins get their targets from a loom huh what did i miss giving a bullet a curve ok i can deal with that but shooting it around a circular room the end is even more hilarious apparently our main character equipped more than a thousand rats rough estimate with a little explosive watch and loaded them up a garbage truck along with more rats that were not equipped with an explosive the garbage truck is driven into the hq of the assassins and the rats spread themselves while he is being shot at by about 68 people none of these people manage to hit him however i thought they were assassins after you watch the rats spread for half a minute they take you back to our main character wesley who somehow got under the garbage truck still unharmed where he takes cover for the rats that are about to blow up the whole building blows up now i dont know how fast rats can run but im pretty sure they are not that fast normally i wouldnt really care about these kind of things but this actually plays a big part in the storylinein short this movie takes itself too serious for it to be taken serious its a decent movie if you want to lean back and enjoy some good matrix style action but it sure aint the blockbuster everyone was hoping for,fantasy
my wife and i havent walked out of a movie in nearly a decade but we gave up on lured in by the stellar cast and a positive review by david edelstein we were expecting dumb loud summer entertainment with great production valueswhat we got was violence porn sin city without the high style or prevailing sense of loss and regret i was worried that i was going to find a bloody tooth in my popcorndont get me wrong i have no illusions about what sells movie tickets or who buys them majorstudio hollywood has long been a purveyor of grisly loud slomo bloodspurting violence but used intelligently by a skilled filmmaker it can be provocative and compelling david cronenbergs most recent films eastern promises and history of violence are shot through with explicit gutchurning mayhem but they dont revel in it on the other hand wants you to savor the thrill of every bloodspattered smack of bullet or fist the first hour of the movie exists largely as a vehicle for the torture of james mcavoy served up for our delectation and amusementlord knows theres a big market for that stuff and i suppose we shouldnt be expecting anything different but whats confusing here is the presence of distinguished alist actors angelina jolie has generally shown better script sense shes always fun to watch but the bluntforce trauma of is light years away from the effervescence of sky captain  morgan freeman has squandered his natural authority by appearing in this spatterfest maybe the heretofore charming mcavoy needs the money but surely jolie and freeman can be choosier if this is what theyve been reduced to why dont they just get to the point and sign on for hostel iii or resident evil iv terence stamp thomas kretschmann i respect these actors and their work they can and must do better than this,fantasy
a slick looking hyperadrenalinerush contrivedflick with an absurdity quotient 15 points off the credibility scale may entertain some whom may still believe that mad max was a real person and that santa claus the tooth fairy and wrestlmania are realyesh there are fine performances by mcavoy and mr freeman jolie looks fine and sultry in a smoky come hitherim gonna beat your ass then apply my considerable lippage to yourskinda waybut the general premise of a fraternity of assassins and there naturally gifted enhanced physical abilities wears wispy thin in the opening sequence where an assassin can manage to pump up his heart rate and adrenaline so he can run and propel himself through significantly sturdy office building plate glass windowwith out having to blink or close his eyesthen able to still have enough momentum to streakin mid airacross almost to another building while shooting pistols and automatic weapons accurately before losing a few feet of elevation and crash through another plate glass office buildingthe movie attempts to get clever with the plot and doesnt work with any believability at the end and actually caused me to groan out loudof course this movie has a steady stream of well crafted action sequences that will surely keep most entertained well those who secretly wish they could be an assassin with angelina jolie as their personal trainerthe movie manages to directly insult its audience towards the end and i was like i am no such thing well thats not exactly what i was thinking but you get the driftthere is also a laughable attempt at visual allegory towards the end hinting at the oh what a tangled web we weaveetc etc blah blah i dont mind suspending my disbelief on a movie where there is some attempt to explain the unbelievable premise such as ironman the incredible hulk etc but this flick i just couldnt hang with,fantasy
i believe this might be an original storyline but what can be stretched out into two to even three stories is crammed into one 2hour long movie i mustve thought the story couldve ended on at least 2 sections of the movie and pick it up later on with more developmentthe also used elements from movies like fight club tomb raider and matrix into this eyecandy extremely bloody action flick with not enough explosions in my opinionthey also spent way too long building the character of the main character and not enough time developing each of the other characters which made all of the rest 2dimensional the casting was awesome and each star seem to fit well into their characters but the script unfortunately didnt give them much to work with angelina jolie gave her best performance in there which is fun to watch if youre a jolie fanthe ending also didnt make much sense it seemed abrupt and not wellthoughtout as morgan freemans character did something that they were trained not to do i understand that they were trying to give a frame to the movie but the frame didnt make sense for what theyre trying to accomplishallinall this movie isnt worth the watch on the big screen unless you dont seeing blood splattered for 10 minutes at a time,fantasy
i never thought id give a film a 1 out of 10 especially one that scored 68 on imdb whoever reviewed it to give it such high scores watching this with my son we both figured that there wasnt going to be a plot to speak of within the first five minutes what it does have is unbelievable special effects and a good measure of gore and ultraviolence that quickly becomes tiresomethe a list cast must have been short of money all have been much better in other movies had this film had a decent plot you might have forgiven it but it simply doesntpossibly the worst film i have ever seen and i have seen some turkeys,fantasy
finally i saw it 201004 i was interested cause i read an article about bekmambetov director of the film in russian forbeswhat can i say  it was a total sh1t sh1ty plot sh1tty ideas of violence and revenge ugly jolie really ugly etc etc i think its not worth to list all negative things here i think i wouldnt be able to name any positive moment or anything positive about this film at all my explanation for this sh1t is bekmambetov he has 3 other successful commercially successful films here in russia a 2 sh1tty dozors night watch and day watch im afraid i wasted time for watching 133 of them  just the same sh1tty mix as in b irony of fate 2  i didnt see it and i am not going to it was successful as it was a sequel of a very wellknown old soviet film bekmambetov is commercially successful but didnt respect his viewer at all  he believes that customer is so stupid that formula for success is twisted plot  u can be hero  jolie  freeman  violence  spec effects  success but as a result i saw another total sh1t so im afraid that in the nearest future you will have an opportunity to see another total sh1t from timur bekmambetov i am very sorry kind regards ivan ps sh1t was used only 8 times here i believe the number should be greater pps i am really sorry for using sh1t but i couldnt find another suitable words they were even worse,fantasy
wesley gibson is a simple office worker tired with his life and past the point of hoping for more before you can say hang on didnt the matrix do this but better gibson is approached by a woman claiming he is the son of a famed killer with nearsupernatural abilities and that he has them too it takes a few gun battles to make him believe the story but gibson is soon under the wing of the fraternity a group of superassassins under the leadership of the shadowy sloan who kill based on the thread patterns sown by a magic loom no really gibson begins training for his ultimate task  taking down the man who killed his father all those years agowas a friday night rental and i cannot imagine it would work any other time than that the plot is a mix between the matrix and a warm turd guess which side the loom is from and it just about pulls a basic frame for lots of action running shouting and gun pornography there is not a point to expecting anything more than this because it offers nothing more except maybe unintentional laughs at the sheer nonsense of the plot this was not a particular problem for me in terms of words on paper but the delivery seemed to suggest that i should take it at least a little bit seriously and is a bit pofaced  to the detriment of the film which really needed to be played for sheer funbecause the action is reliant on the plot and characters to draw us in it cannot save the film but it certainly provides a distraction the excessive abilities of these humans is another turn off in regards getting into it but on the flipside it does provide some action sequences that are so outrageous that it is hard not to enjoy them for the sheer spectacle director bekmambetov is probably a reasonable choice if this is the only aim as he also made that superficial vampire success the other year but he cannot draw anything from the talented cast nor draw the audience in i feel a little sorry for james mcavoy as he has solid roles under his belt and was due his big action film role however this shows that when opportunity does knock you should probably answer with the door on the chain just in case he has a fairly thankless role but throws himself into it well enough within the context of the film morgan freeman dials in his performance but yet it still fits jolie has clearly just been told to pout and look sexy as much as possible because that is all she does personally i found her skinny frame to be alarmingly unsexy and wondered who she is surrounding herself with that nobody has taken her to side about how bad she looks in this film the support cast offer little but their familiar faces and are a weird bunch of stamp common warren and othersis a fairly basic film then but one that has enough money thrown at the action to just about make it appeal to the teenage boy in us all however it is impossible to ignore just how very daft it all is and how none of it really gets the heart going instantly forgettable stuff but if youre looking for something noisy and totally undemanding then this would fit that bill,fantasy
2008 sees a long list of action packed movies on the big screen although isnt as big a picture as iron man or the dark knight it certainly is worth watchingeven though most action movies are labeled as guy movies as a girl i certainly enjoyed this adrenalin filled rushwatching wesley transform from a mild mannered and almost pathetic office worker to a confident and perhaps cocky assassin is the perfect thing for a quiet friday nightangelina jolie and morgan freeman also hold their own in this onetimur bekmambetov who was responsible for the fantastic russian vampire movies day watch  night watch certainly put his stamp on the movie his trademark slowmo and almost surreal action sequence shots puts into a class of its own,fantasy
i like the idea lots of reviewers find this movie unoriginal but really what action movie is people seem to hold the matrix as the pinnacle of scifi but it has glaring similarities to star wars and even the bible originality out the window this is a decent movie to watch for lots of bullets and car chases just dont expect anything too deepthe cast was immensely flawed the main character mcenvoy is almost too typical it seemed like this character was a wimpy tool turned killing machine solely to cater to the 20something video game crowd did the office scenes remind anyone else of office space i started to hate the fraternity almost as much as i hate reallife frats as every member had a stupid arrogant smirk on their face like i know something you dont times 100 i dont think a single assassin changed expressions once as they went from smug to overlysmugthe special effects are lovehate i liked the car chases and most of the shootings except for the bullets colliding midair that was cool the first time but since its an event that has likely never happened or ever will happen it grew tired by about the fourth repetition one thing that absolutely disgusted me was how the main character survived the farthest fall ever with no major injuriesif you want to see a quick flick with lots of action this is a good pick the stereotypical charactersstory elements however were very questionable at times and just reminded me of those kids in middle school that were always fakeshooting each other and trying to do matrix moves in gym class,fantasy
aka a modest yarn of mixed fabrication a warning if you are a vegetarian dont even think about going to see several scenes take place in a kind of meat store and the large hanging chunks of meat are as vividly memorable as angelinas tattoosim almost ashamed to admit that i rather enjoyed this piece of friday night fluff no fluff is the wrong word its extremely violent in a cartoonish way and not remotely fluffy lots of lingering shots of bullets penetrating skin and the red stuff flying hither and thither to call it light weight is paying it a compliment its so light weight it makes ms jolie look like a body builder is watchable because it never takes itself too seriously i spent the first ten minutes wondering if i should get up go home and have an early night then i grasped that it was a comic book and went along for the reasonably entertaining ride i should point out up front that this film is aimed unapologetically at the 1830 male demographic with its lingering shots of angelinas butt and mouth and routinely obnoxious female characters ms jolie excepted so we all know what we are getting with this one okjames mcavoy plays wesley gibson a rather weedy young man who works in a cubicle as some kind of customer service rep his girl friend is bonking his best friend on his ikea dining table am i getting old or does that look really uncomfortable and his boss resembles a beached walrus with a bad hangover one day on a trip to the grocery store someone starts shooting at him and to cut a long story short he discovers he is the son of a fabled assassin who belonged to an ancient order of assassins  the fraternity  who masquerade as weavers but spend their off time taking out the worlds nastiest people think of them as boy scouts with very large weapons they are always prepared and in order to prepare our wesley to take his place amongst the splatterati the fraternity prepare him very well indeed by beating him up daily and dunking him in rejuvenating baths as spa treatments go this one is awesome looks a bit like hot wax mmmmmmmmmmmangeline jolie as fox is one of the top honchos which has me wondering whether calling it a fraternity might not be a bit misleading i guess calling it the coed was a non starter she plays this strictly tongue in cheek and looks so underfed that i doubt she could raise one of the weapons to shoulder height never mind wield it menacingly morgan freeman plays the boss sloan every now and then the magic weaving machine spews forth the name of another victim and that was about the place where i actually started giggling how did morgan freeman manage to utter the words loom of fate with a straight face this must be the kind of stuff they prepare you for in acting school and all i can say is i take my hat off to him after an encounter with terence stamp playing a monk my but hasnt stamp come a long way since far from the madding crowd there is a fairly entertaining chase through a train and a spectacular wreck in a deep gorge and our hero wesley finds out that his dad may not be who he thought and the goodies may be the baddies after all the loom of fate has spewed his own name out but he takes his revenge with a novel plague of explosive rats who all become willing suicide rodents because they are high on peanut butter or some such equally ludicrous detail anyway if james mcavoy was looking for something diametrically opposite to atonement i think he found it in its unlikely to get oscar nominated but i think i could actually sit through it one more time just to hear morgan freeman say loom of fate again classic i was mildly interested in where they filmed this so i sat through the endless reel of credits to the very end just to put me out of my misery can anyone tell me what a libra head technician is do they have a head technician for every sign of the zodiac just curious,fantasy
i walked into theaters excited and i came back out feeling the same way and the film to me is highly recommended im a gore hound and the blood was flying everywhere so i got my treat the story was great the acting was superb and the actionoh yeah the action it just me to say holy sht that was frigging awesome definitely a winner in my bookswas perhaps one of the greatest action flicks of the year but im still waiting for tropic thunder and pineapple express though this film will although hold me together till that time comesfor my say watch this and you will be leaning on the edge of your seat waiting for the pause button to be presses or the credits to rollthats how amazing this film is highly recommended especially the violence raavveenn out,fantasy
like other dweeby action stars before him toby mcquire ed norton  now surprisingly robert downey jr james mcavoy continues his ascendancy in the hollywood firmament by becoming an action hero of all things supported by a list actors like morgan freeman  angelina jolie  he is in good company but make no doubt about it  this is his movie  he carries it off even though the movies seems like one long car train bus chase ok there is a plot of sorts about a fraternity  some fatherson issues but basically this is a cartoon comic book that is there to fill up our summer hours i would have liked a little more sex  a little less violence but all in all it was a pleasant enough movie going experience but please skip the sequel  spare us,fantasy
after seeing i am legend speed racer and the happening i was beginning to think that maybe my only hope for a quality film this year would lie in the hands of walle and the dark knight however thanks to this is the first time in five or six months that ive left the theater feeling absolutely satisfied  wishing i could live the life of an assassinis wonderful there is no other word to describe the cinematography comedy action and acting in this picture this movie does exactly what it sets out to do  engage the audience in an actionpacked kickass story with the occasional drama and comedic reliefi havent been this satisfied with an action movie since the matrix,fantasy
the film never really grabbed me from the trailers it was simply taking the action genre to another level of absurdity thats exactly what i expected and exactly what i got i did have fun but was left unfulfilled by the end of it it was immature and inane in a lot of parts and the wow factor never really got me it was all done in the trailers leaving an empty film for us viewers to watchit has the beautiful jolie who after a handful of serious roles is able to relax and have fun here she is laura croft with a more bad ass attitude and sexy tattoos james mcavoy tries his best as the leading man he does a decent job but fails to have any connection with jolie terence stamp is hardly in the movie to really comment on him and morgan freeman takes a different role here as the baddie without a doubt he has the best line of the filmno the best line of 2008 his delivery is hilarious and frightening at the same timeive seen nightwatch and see the same hyper style here its something that i expect to see a lot more of from him it may get tiring fast for some peoplei never heard of the gn before the film and didnt think anything that wasnt popular would be turned into a film this film proved me wrong twists and turns happen here all for predictable and some of really aggravating specifically what jolie does at the end anyway i can recommend the film simply on a pure entertainment never take a single frame of this film seriously type way,fantasy
the rare pretentious schmuck would blindly badmouth this movie doesnt set out to change lives or inspire the deaf to hear the blind to see or the normal to become great this is a thrill ride you dont buy a ticket to this movie to break on through to the other side accompanied by newfound philosophy you buy a ticket to take a shot of adrenaline and enjoy some cool special effects bonus you get to see angelinas ass its fun to watch its enjoyable and at times funny for such a movie the level of cinematographic meticulousness was surprising and entertaining thats what this movie is despite clichs and corny lines the end pulls it together and brings it above average remember its no citizen kane but then again it doesnt set out to be so dont set out for a life changing experience,fantasy
with a new breed of stunning footage angelina jolie is a superstar with pure lucidity of understanding her roles like mr and mrs smith the record for her fitness is a number fixed in her head and she pulls those figures in training and with basics jolie with a bright look like a person full of brightness like in the movies is a sight,fantasy
this movie is so good and yet so bad and it reeks of the 2000s this is the perfect guilty pleasure movie for action fans and its on netflix,fantasy
i really enjoy this movie i love acting in this movie,fantasy
i just re watch the entire movie today and i have to say that this movie is still very watchable the bullet bending thing is pretty cool and the way they we see the bullets trajectory path is pretty pretty good this is a top notch action movie with really good action scenes with cars chasing knife fighting bare buckle beatingsas the biggest angelina jolie lover i would say she is very tough in this film especially when she beats up james maccoythe movie still keep my attention even if i have seen it before many times so i was about to give it an 8 but because angelina is in it i bump it up to a 10 also you get to see angelinas butt in it,fantasy
i think this is that kind of movie that gives everyone that exitmentto see a movie without a problemit is present that kind of real action you are looking forwithout mentioning the great performance of actors in this movieangelina jolie will not disapoint you she still got the classit maybe should give us a little bit more of the story,fantasy
i dont get all those bad comment it was a good pastime with great music plenty of action  awesome actor ,fantasy
when you see angelina jolie in a movie  it becomes hard for others to get noticed but james mcavoy showed his talent in this movie that became well known in next years  filth   great action movie and it is funny too ,fantasy

an ordinary man with an ordinary job a backstabbing friend and an infidel girlfriend finds himself one day chased by a couple of people who introduce him to a couple of powers he didnt know he had after much training he must obey the orders of the organization and ultimately kill a dangerous man who supposedly killed his fatherits a movie which is designed to wow the viewer through its spectacular cgi characters powers and extraordinary events unfortunately as one can expect from this type of film the plot is left in the background having almost nothing to sustain the imagery except for a plot twist which doesnt change much i was impressed with the special effects they truly are spectacular but i have to add that they are way to exaggerated from any point of view if you can accept this aspect youre going to have a pretty good time with this oneits nice to watch and it will be quite entertaining if you dont have high expectations in terms of plot and character development,fantasy
ok just to get things straight i hate action movies i watched this one 3 times in a row when it came out and 2 more times sinceusually when i watch long overthetop action scenes im like meh give me the damn plot already but action scenes in are hilariously selfconscious about how overthetop they are theres this scene in the beginning where james mcavoy knocks out his shitty friends teeth with a pc keyboard and then a couple of keys and one tooth form a fck u in the air for a moment i saw this and i was sold whats not to love this is deadpool v2008 guys watch it,fantasy
this is the type of movie that is created for the entertainment of the audience and that is all there is to itlots of actions and fighting scenes with lots of blood as well the movie though doesnt lose the plot even though the twist that happens in the story is unexpected to a pointthe story is basically about how we get caught up in a job that we hate with a boss that we hate and basically end up in a life that we hateit obviously leads to our main character exploding with the realization that he cant take living the way he does and decides to finally take charge of his own lifesomething that many people need to start doing if they are to feel satisfied with the way their life is lookingso the main characters life changes forever and he is plunged into the world of assassins and where every shot counts an interesting scene in the movie is when the main character is asked to curve the bullet and the main character responds with the typical answer that its impossible to do such a thingthe response to that is if you were handed a gun for the first time how would you know that it shoots in a straight linethis is basically saying that we put limitations on what we are able to do just because ewe are unaware that it can be donethat we give up almost before we even tryi found that that was a very good message given to the audience through the film,fantasy
wesley gibson james mcavoy is working in a job that he hates as an account manager when fox angelina jolie explains to wesley that his father that left him at 7 days old has been murdered fox rescues wesley from the man that shot his father and then he is asked to kill the assassin because no one else is capable sloan morgan freeman heads the fraternity of the assassins and trains wesley to be an assassin wesley comes to find out that cross the man that killed wesleys father is really his father and has been trying to save his sons life from the real bad guy sloan the theme of this film as it is stated in the last line is what have you done lately in your life in six weeks wesley trained and became an assassin he was nearly beat to death on several occasions or cut with knives while learning to fight wax baths would heal all wounds to prepare for the next step of training the filmmakers of used slow motion technique throughout the film slow motion suggested superhuman speed and power of the assassins the slow motion technique is mostly used while jolie and mcavoy are acting the sound of wesleys heartbeat was enhanced in the beginning of the film wesleys heart was racing and he would have anxiety attacks then he was told why his heart raced and how he needed to learn to control it to be a great assassin the purpose of emphasis was to show his superhuman powers that he was given and how he had learned to slow his heart rate down when it would go out of control there are some unrealistic components of the film such as rolling cars over other cars and landing perfect to keep moving curved bullets living through a train car crashing in a gorge of water from several thousand feet a loom deciding fate with who is to be killed next shooting the wings off of flies and then finding them in a trash can if you are into superhuman action movies that star jolie then this is the movie for you,fantasy
spoilersone of the themes running throughout this movie is fate that things are because they are and we have to accept that and that inevitably it is unavoidable yes i know bullets cant be bent round corners but for the sake of they can loom machines arent able to real off names to be assassinated but again for the sake of they cani like angelina jolie and she is usually well cast however it was only really half way through before she started to fit her character perfectly upon watching the film again this isnt an issue but i feel she did seem a little awkward at timesits hard not to compare james mcavoy to keanu reeves neo both wesley and neo start of their respective films in an inescapable rut and while not as cool as neo james mcavoy also makes the transition with ease and wesley becomes a very likable protagonist i also thought morgan freeman played his part well although the rest of the cast were only really background characters i did like the russian vodka guy thoughthe plot was very clich in parts you are my son and how wesley managed to survive it all i dont know but james bond has managed it throughout the years the first twenty minutes or so are a bit slow but it quickly picks up and kept me more than entertained throughoutdid borrow quite a lot from other films but so what there must have been a point in cinema where its almost impossible not to borrow from other filmsis film that plays on the ideas of revenge retribution and fate and throw in some cool action a clich ridden plot and likable characters and you have a very good film,fantasy
james macavoy plays wesley a normal boring office guy who finds out he is the son of a super assassin who was killed in the line of duty and now the fraternity want to employ wesley to avenge his father the film is based on mark millars comic book series this has some amazing special effects that will keep the average movie maniac glued and the action istamecompared to the hk bloodshed movies i know a lot of people who thought the end shootout was spectacularobviously they havent seen collateral heatmatrixthe film was okay and did provide some generally amazing moments and jaw droppinganjelina coming out of the tub and even james macavoys body wasspectacularall in all a good film but the plot isnt as great as some of the other comic book series,fantasy
i cant believe that this has such a high rating i think pretty much all the interns of all companies involved rated this one upacting  alrightstundts  mehstory  pukecharacters  unlovable but not in the icantbelievetheypainteditso good kind of way cinematography  ah so so music  boring well i would advice everyone to stay away from it its not worth your money nor your timego watch some old classic where they actually drive a couple of cars into objects instead of another cheap cgi animated piece of tripethe transformation from looser to hero boy with no direction to man with a mission is way to quick and told in such broad strokes and colors its patheticsave your time please i know its a comic book but its still so much over the top without having the aesthetics that for example 300 had or sin city for that matterflat flat flat,fantasy
having watched this movie around when it was released and having mostly forgotten about it but remember enjoying it and hoping for a sequel decided to watch it again and noticed more things on this viewing than when first watched it a decade or so agothis film is based on a comic book series and it seems that many of the negative reviews dont understand its concept or purpose much criticism is how unrealistic the film is with the bullets curving or some other stunts but that was merely on purpose and what makes this film stand out it may be more style over substance but there is enough mindless action entertainment to enjoy james mcavoy in one of his earlier leading roles is well liked and was a great choice for the lead along with the supporting cast of angelina jolie and morgan freemanfeaturing several twists along the way as one had forgotten on this viewing but afterwards had felt it served its purpose and worked a lot of negative hate seems to come from the fact tat people were expecting a different type of film this wasnt supposed to be james bond or jason bourne or die hard it has its purpose and it pulls it off only a shame is how they never made a sequel,fantasy
honestly could not believe all the negative reviews on here or that the average score was below 80 i saw this movie in theaters when it came out with a group of about 6 people everyone loved it and it was one of those movies where as you walked out everyone knew it would be ridiculous to ask did you like it instead the questions were what was your favorite part and do you rank this above or below insert all time great action moviei just rewatched it with my dad who was seeing it for the first time he also loved it and hes a very picky moviegoer this is an imaginative superreal action movie much like the matrix or john wick it tells a sort of fantasy story a lot of people can relate to the acting is on point and it has some of the most imaginative and heart pumping action sequences ive ever seen in a moviethe negative reviewers here often seem to have not even seen the movie making bizarre incorrect claims like it never tells you why they have super human powers it does not in great detail but that wasnt necessary and would probably have detracted from the experiencesee it for yourself if you,fantasy
if youre looking for a particularly amazing action film this definitely aint it but after watching it twice out of sheer boredom it manages to keep my attention for those two hourswhile i love james mcavoy for a lot of the stuff hes in this portrayal of a whiny entitled dweeb works kinda well if you dont think about itsure the action is dumb and just popcorn film stuff but no one should be expecting that going into a film about assassins who get their targets from linen and can curve bulletshonestly just a fun two hours i recommend it,fantasy
is one of my guilty pleasure movies i liked it as a kid for its explicit action and the coole stunts and still these are the reason i come back to this movie from time to timesometimes the movie seems a little trashy and over the top but if you dont care too much and enjoy the action sequences you can definitely find things to like about this movie,fantasy
to call an action movie would be like calling cannibal holocaust a horror flick this movie is one step removed from being the most stylish snuff film ever made is full of flair inventive action scenes and good special effects and sound but it is thoroughly violent taken on craft alone is good but factor in the effect of the endless scenes of vicious bloody murder and this becomes a film you endure rather than enjoyis about james mcavoys wesley a frustrated office worker who is recruited by angelina jolie and morgan freeman into an underground assassin community to finish his legendary gun master fathers last job or at least that is what the plot summary is about in reality is about violence lots and lots of increasingly brutal violence wesley and fox jolie kill gobs of hulking thugs sometimes in creative ways but always with bullets lots of bullets and thats the movie basically characters stop and talk here and there but almost no single scene ends without somebody getting maimed or killedthose scenes of protracted murder start out kind of fun there are some imaginative sniper scenes with long slow motion tracking shots of the bullet as it passes through the air and fox teaches wesley to curve bullets in a memorable early scene director timur bekmambetov takes a hardedged gritty kind of style and rolls with it for about an hour you might get caught up in the mayhem by the end its just too much the movie is under two hours but without any kind of engaging story to prop up the action fatigue sets in quick as things get more and more gruesome the slickness of the bloodshed is lost replaced by a feeling of nauseous unpleasantness i understand is no family film and i can get into angry stressrelieving ultraviolence as much as anybody but is a bridge too far for me it is a very mean spirited movie taking way too much gleeful pleasure in blowing the brains out of hundreds of heads thats where the movie really crossed into snuff territory for me i can handle violence i can handle very gruesome violence but the kind of sustained gun porn seen in would test anyones stomach the action is done well and in a shorter more absorbing story it would work by itself drawn out over almost two hours it doesnt your results may vary but after a while i was entirely turned off by54100,fantasy
i really enjoyed this a nonstop action movie that doesnt take itself too seriously i mean its a total popcorn flick way overthetop at times but done in such a fun entertaining way that you just go with it and think that was kinda awesome the opening scenes are very cool and set the tone welljames mcavoy plays a frustrated american office worker who is recruited by a sexy  mysterious jolie to join a secret society of assassins and avenge the murder of his estranged father this has a real matrix vibe to it with healing baths an oracle loom bullets able to go around corners because the character thinks they can stuff like that theres also a great twist involved and some seriously awesome stunts including jolie scooping mcavoy up with her car ott train crash sequence and the two of them playing atop commuter trains super funi just love angelina jolie in these action roles she is just so cool sure she only weighs about 95 lbs here and i doubt would have the strength to pull off any of the fight scenes without eating a sandwich first but i still enjoy watching her do her thing i enjoyed mcavoy too i always do even though it was weird to hear him with an american accent no reason why they couldnt have kept his character scottish 101914,fantasy
there is an old saw in the movie review biz that if a stranger asks you to retell the plot of a film and you become uncomfortable or excessively selfaware in the process chances are it wasnt that much of a plot to start with which pretty much sums up based on a graphic novel ie comic to anyone over the age of 7 about a bunch of weavers not a misprint who centuries ago decided to become assassins when one of their looms starting telling them who deserved killing which might possibly be seen as a cockeyed tribute to son of sam who allegedly took his marching orders from a german shepherd except that in terms of this bizarre backstory sam is the more recent historical figure as directed with manic persistence by russian wonderkind timur bekmambetov however the movie is less about plot than it is about action and there is indeed action lots and lots until the very last half hour or so at which point most theatergoers will be more interested in whats for dinner that night than in how ultimately resolves its many dangling and equally uninteresting plot threads the street buzz in tinseltown is that angelina jolie is much more of a drawing card for the testosterone set than than any other face in this opus there is much truth to this but with a serious caveat the film that established jolie as an action hero was her lara croft gig in 2001 it is now 7 years later and in spite of lips that merit their own zip code jolie is simply not getting any younger in fact this oscarwinner does not so much act in this film as haunt it always just on the edge of the shot somehow always surveying the action rather than participating she seems to be at the odd stage of her career where she is paid very handsomely mindyou simply to do an impersonation of her younger self  a task she does arguably better than anyone else on the planet,fantasy
i love this movie this is a major spoiler but i thought the whole loom of fate bit was ridiculous that was a major plot hole where did the loom come from what is this fate thing that is running it why would fate get involved in the lives of mortals why does fate care so much about having a balance in the universe so there was no logic in it also it seemed silly to take orders from a loom it would have been better if they had just left the whole loom bit out overall its a great action movie it has angelina jolie in it and shes great i like that he left his snarky and horrible girlfriend she was really annoying and i love how he quit his job hehe,fantasy
after seeing james mcavoy in last king of scotland and atonement it was certainly jarring to hear his american accent and this wouldnt be the only thing jarring about the movie it earns its r rating easily by being very violent perhaps irredeemably violent i have nothing against violence in movies either but i dont go to movies for the violence i go for involving story and for all its cool camera work and follow the bullet imagery just didnt grab me the action is topnotch but unlike the bourne movies not set in reality which should be cool but is less then expected and certainly doesnt have the emotional resonance of those movies either the chase in bourne ultimatum on the roof tops playing cat and mouse then the fight to the death being rated r doesnt have anything as suspenseful or intensefinally for all i respect mcavoy as an actor i didnt enjoy him in this his character is a whiny wimpwhos transformed into a elite skilled assassin his scared act is played for laughsfor me it was just annoying and the journey from wimp to badass really has been done better in movies that uses for inspiration fight club the matrix seem to be quoted freely both as ideas and visually i was ready to be blown away by this and just felt the director has the technical chops and a very capable cast but the script was just derivative it gave the actors little material to really bite into making them into movable pieces in the action scenes this makes me appreciate something like what tarantino is able to accomplish in grade a superior action junk food like kill bill is getting decent reviews but for me it was a disappointment,fantasy
within every nerd lurks a superpowered killing machine thats the message of the latest moviecumvideo game from hollywood oh and did i mention angelina jolie she of the pneumatic lips digs nerds who are superpowered killing machines with night watch and day watch timur bekmambetov proved he could direct stylish but incoherent russian fantasies with he demonstrates he can do the same thing for tinseltown shoot em ups there are some amusing scenes with bullets whizzing in around and through things but after a while it all starts to look the same morgan freeman and terence stamp alist actors are also in this bpicture looking slightly embarrassed with more than a few plot points borrowed from the star wars series luke i am your father the force is strong in this one for those who care we briefly get to see jolies perfect posterior it almost redeems this otherwise saggy mess,fantasy
this film is like the bastardised love child of fight club the matrix and assassins creed but not quite as good as any of them individuallythe first major downfall of this film is the obscene lack of realism this i usually would not normally mind as i do not feel it is a necessity in modern cinema had they not try to explain it away with something so completely preposterous apparently with a little bit of training a surge of adrenaline will allow you to leap between skyscrapers effectively put yourself in bullet time and get some form of natural optical zoom in your eyes im pretty dam sure that even with a massively over active adrenal gland you will not be able to accomplish any of these feats and i would have much rather seen these things put down to something more realistic like superpowers or aliensas my title summary suggests this film also takes the natural laws of physics ramps a mustang in a barrel roll fashion over it but fails landing short and crushing any regard for them whatsoever seriously some of this stuff although entertaining was completely ridiculous at one part fox manages to flip a dodge viper with 2 flat tires over a barricade of police cars i know your thinking well thats pretty cool and it might happen which is fair enough and thats about where this particular stunt should have stopped but it doesnt to land this stretch of automotive acrobatics she plants the car wheels first into the side of what must be a 23 ton bus immediately flipping the public transport vehicle onto its side with a car that must weigh less than half of that powering it over and she is then able to drive off also the whole curving bullets thing again although cool was a bit silly and again totally impossible if you just have a little extra adrenaline frankly i found these sections to be stupid and it spoiled the experience a little for me as it stopped me from immersing myself in the film properlybut even considering the above this was by no means a bad film the fight and chase sequences were all exhilarating if a bit obtuse and packed with good cgi i found the plot to be much better than i anticipated with a couple of twists and it never seemed to get boring the performances are pretty solid as can be expected from the likes of morgan freeman and angelina joliealso the beginning sequence reminded me greatly of the fight club scenario with the mundane mild mannered office worker suddenly drawn into a world of violence and weird happenings the introduction of wesley gibson and his life make it very easy to sympathise with the characterin short id say that this film is undeniably cool and will not let you relax for one second but was simply too implausible to enjoy the full experience,fantasy
i never bought the comic despite the good art im not a fan of mark millars comic book writing my hope was that the movie would be better than the comic regardless of how much i dislike millars writing thankfully someone else wrote the screenplaythere are movies that are so bad they are good this isnt one there are movies where the special effects are cool and you dont care about the story this isnt one there are movies where the actors are so good they can carry a bad story and make it work this isnt one there are movies that just have a stunning plot and you watch it thinking wow this isnt onethe story starts stupid and gets progressively more stupid at random intervals throughout its attempt to try and be clever fall short its attempt to be visually exciting just makes your eyes rolli say dont waste your time seeing it ignore the dvd release im going to give it 4 stars for being boring and stupid,fantasy
most people will not agree with me but this movie is ridiculously immature to be put out by adults i love it when people say dont take it too seriously just disconnect your brain and enjoy funny that sounds sort of disturbing in the let us tell you what to believe and dont think for yourself way heres why i take issue not because i dont know how to lighten up or just sit back and be entertained but because a number of vulnerable teenage minds are picking up this movie yes they have plenty of access to r movies and taking it seriously so while we more mature adults are telling ourselves the ideology of taking control of your life by getting ticked off at everyone who ever pushed you around is not to be taken seriously a whole generation of sadly underparented children is thinking that this is what we mature adults believe after all we put out the movie and we helped propagate it by paying money to see it so some sadly misunderstood kid decides to take control of his life and take a gun into his school shoot the girl that turned him down the teacher that was too hard on him and the bully that pushed him in the hall this movie seems to say good for you you know what grow up and i think we adults need to do some growing up too and stop excusing the pushing of philosophies like this with the irresponsible lament its only a movie its not like it really influences anyone hardyharhar,fantasy
im revising my commentary again on this movie after seeing it more than a few times it keeps getting better after each viewing its about a fraternity of assassins whove been around for 1000 years who kill based on the orders of fate a theoretically pure process divining who will be killed based on the best interest of humankind and to maintain balance in the world but a rogue member is killing fellow members and a son of one of the fraternity is recruited to kill the rogue the possibilities and convolutions from that premise are plentiful and they are fully exploredyou do have to fight through the incredible violence much like the matrix its inyourface stuff and a few artistic liberties but there are some real spiritual intellectual and emotional ideas being presented here along with some great visuals if youre able you will understand and hook into them and come to absolutely love this movie even more with each successive viewing  jolies understated performance is nice but its the story the ideas attention to detail and intensity that provide the brilliance its a twisting turning thoughtful eventful intellectually honest unique trip that will meet every expectation you have in a movie the last 25 minutes and final confrontation are a cinematic masterpiecethis is one of the best movies ive seen in the last 5 years and maybe one of the top 10 movies ive seen period  warning you might not get the genius of this movie from one viewing but youll be drawn to watch it again and again buy into this movie from the start and it wont let you down,fantasy
wesley gibsons mcavoy life is going nowhere and he knows it and can doing nothing about it then he is told his father was a top assassin and was recently killed wes is given the chance to avenge his fathers death by joining a secret society of assassinsi thought the last die hard movie live free or die hard was the best ever action movie mr and mrs smith was very good too along with hitman what you didnt see that then i saw omg i saw stunts that i have never seen performed before whether in real time or cgi didnt matter i saw bullets turn corners well we do know that is fiction but it works in this movie and i saw a brutal training program for wes of course that had me on the floor crawling to the bathroom for rolls of gauze neosporin and vicodin wow this movie is on a par with live free or die hard excellent the acting by all is very good but the stunts whether real or with cgi hard to tell sometimes keep this movie going at breakneck speed and you dont get lost you are right there with it enjoying and yes cringing with every moment but then something began to happen i didnt care about wes or any of the characters i just yes a little play on words the stunts to keep coming the more the better i did not care if wes succeeded or if anyone succeeded as long as the stunts kept coming yes i felt the characters were developed enough i knew what they were about  you will know too  hey they are assassins what more do you need to know but i just didnt care about them i more stunts they were so good i was hooked they were far different and superior from anything i have ever seen and wowyes there is a story here and its pretty good and there are some twists and turns as wellbut it will be the stunts you will be talking about yes although this action movie is very good live free or die hard is still number one with meviolence yes sex yes an early scene jumps right into it really not needed here not for the kids nudity no surprisingly language yes,fantasy
i to love this film after all the reviews were so positive but then came the film in century city los angeles with a friend on the 4th of july and what a disappointment act one had too many scenes of developing the male lead and only when angelina jolie hit the screen with her incredible smirk and body that became a bit more interestingyes some scenes were bloody the car chases well seen one car chase and youve seen them all the sets as dark as the characters but unless jolie is on the screen is nothing more than a frat boy flick with dialog that is trite and dull however when the action kicks into gear jolie in the lead then the price of seeing this film is worthwhile otherwise skip this film,fantasy
i saw the trailers for it and i have to admit that the tattoos showing on the back of angelina jolie made me wanna see it just a little bit more what can i say im a manbut wow this movie is awesome i read on here that people say that its not realistic its too much like matrix was matrix not an excellent movie with the exception that you had to watch it a few times to understand it people listen its a movie its not supposed to be realistic and especially about bending bullets come on anyone expecting to see a movie that is realistic when in the trailers it pretty much shows you people bending bullets what would you expect action is over the top but its awesome cgi over the top but its awesome no guidelines for reality but its awesome well worth seeing at the movies ignore the comments about it being stupid and not realistic well duh i could have told you that before seeing the movie one of the best movies this year you all need to go see it,fantasy
the matrix was a great movie why because it had a premise we could buy into yes it also had a nerdy white boy but his transformation was to be a sign of a new world to come now i take no responsibility for the mess that was made of the sequels but the original was fun i bring up the matrix because i also blame that movie for the long litany of movies that came after glorifying violence in ways that make most your people numb and the rest of us just sick is another one of those movies it wants to be taken seriously and yet it gives too simplistic an explanation for what wesleyjames mcavoy does for a while i thought that it was going to dwell deeper but then of course the filmmakers pull back and revert again to stylized violence so to every nerdy white boy who sees this movie and thinks all he needs is his own brand of assassin training a big gun some special bullets that shots around things from long distances and i can be in controltreating everyone that i feel wronged me i say maybe you need to ask yourself that question they kept asking wesley too bad he couldnt figure out a better more productive answer,fantasy
overall this movie was very good i went into this movie expecting a thrill ride and thats exactly what it is from beginning to end if youve watched the previews you already know there is a lot of overblown action in this movie however it never takes itself too seriously and a lot of it has surprisingly good explanations james mcavoy does a good job in the lead role and makes a believable action star the rest of the cast is sharp as well with angelina jolie standing out very well its nice seeing her returning to this kind of role there are some humorous moments in the movie to nicely balance the action and i think the director did a pretty nice job in the action sequences there is only one thing that truly bothers me about this movie at the end but i wont give it away however i will say that it is an insignificant detail not some major plot point of any kind but as a whole i would definitely recommend this movie at all summer moviegoers,fantasy
yes it was one of the nights where you just go to the movies because you want to be entertained last night there was no other choice than and i gave it at least a try  even i was a bit skepticalto be honest i lose confidence in mankind if there is anybody out there who loves or even accepts this movieyes i know we call it drama or thriller if there is stupid unrealistic speed driving bullets entering a humans head in slowmotion tons of blood smile in a face by killing a human being without any proved reasonand such a stupid bloodshed story is legitimated by it is just based on a comici am sorry  everybody who writes such a story who is producing such a project who is directing such a movie who is acting in such a movie who is watching such a movie with funis definitely making our world worse and not bettera message to everybody who earns money with this feel ashamed even morgan freeman whom i really respect still after this a message to everybody who lost the money by watching it let us prove better next time where we spend out money on a message to everybody who loves this movie rethink your valuesthis movie is just ridiculous,fantasy
wait for dvd eta 1 weekthis movie was terrible and should have never got to theaters after sitting down to watch it i kept wanting to get up and leave its more of that gun dancing unrealistic unnecessarily violent bs at some points the dialog is so weak like people talking just for the sake of it while adding nothing to the ploti cant believe morgan freedman and angelina jolie wasted their time on this im unfamiliar with the graphic novel i was also unfamiliar with v for vendetta but that movie was great this on the other hand was garbageits a movie about assassins i like that i thought then it turns all weird and has people flipping their guns and making bullets curve around things  thats where it lost me im thinking thats physically impossible it might be ok to have a superhero with superpowers but making a modern device like a gun do something its not supposed to do is too much its a freaking gun its not a samurai sword,fantasy
to get right to the point i found this movie very distressing to watch i do like watching action genre films but theres a line drawn where movies is divided by the sense of being realistic which i prefer to enjoy and totally unbelievable ill put the movie in the place of being completely farfetchis all that special effects necessary well watching the film it appears it relies more on effects than the storyline itselfs that i really had a problem with since we are in the 21th century now and filmmakers are looking for new ways of being innovative this is where the problem lies too many film makers are using their film budget more on special effects these days like it was hard to take notice of the narrative because of the constance special effect so to answer the question special effects is necessary in disaster genre pictures such as the day after tomorrow action films such as shoot em up and uses special effects to make it look better when it looks ok on its own that is why i prefer the die hard rambo movies 20 years ago where special effects werent a issuei mentioned about it being beyond disbelieve audiences today arent considering the logicbut are more being amazed by the slowmotion scenesfastpace action and special effects for example one scene in the movie wesley gibson crashes his car and spins over a limo to shoot the target through the sunroof thinking about it if a car spins over this limo it will take approximately one second in this second the character had time to say the line im sorry and shoot the target when the car is spinning at that point i couldnt bare to watch any morefinal outcome is that modern films are taking special effects as a alternative to make to appear better which i dislike about action films today this movie would of been better if the special effects was cut down or taken out the acting was average and had an interesting story with twists but unfortunately this year is the worst movie of 2008 so far,fantasy
is a dull exercise in guns blood ridiculous vehicular stunts and mediocre cgi i appreciate the films unapologetic inyourface attitude but the experience is overwhelmingly generic theres your usual bulletbending matrixstyle action hackishly combined with a story about a nebbishy cpa who discovers hes the son of an assassinmcavoy is unremarkable in the lead rolei actually found him quite grating and unlikeable and never really believed he was some badass killer theres some star power here as well w morgan freeman and angelina jolies lipsthey are adequate but not really given much to work with and anyway the actors take a backseat to the bloody action and mayhem which ive seen done better in some of the ultraviolent asian action flicks this movie is so obviously trying to emulatestay away from filmgoing public stay away,fantasy
i just finished viewing this film and i must say that i was not very impressed i may be too judgmental but here is what i thought about the film from some aspects which i find to be keyi dont mind a film using language if its done in a tasteful manner such as se7en or pulp fiction but this film did not it seemed that they were trying to squeeze in obscenities to make the film have more of an edge and appeal to those looking for more of a bada appeal when in reality it only added to the films weak dialog that brings up the dialog as a whole which was far below par for what script writers are capable of now i dont expect it to be like a humphrey bogart casablanca monologue but some amount of effort should be put forth there were just too many clich lines derived from a poor attempt at humorthe cinematography for the film was decent for the majority nothing very innovative but average however whenever the characters were running or in cars the camera becomes so shaky that you almost cannot follow the action but while the action scenes are not all well shot there are some which are pretty cool i found the concept of curving bullets and shooting bullets out of the air pretty cool but not necessarily original i noticed a similarity to this film and several others eg the matrix and equilibrium especially in the scene where wesley comes through the window there were other portions which were extremely clich for instance when wesley hits barry with the keyboard and a word is spelled out using one of barrys teethgranted that most movies require a suspension of reality requires its destructionthere is some sexuality in the film including two sex scenes in which a male butt is seen and there is enough movement to know whats happening though nothing explicit is seen angelina jolies character is also seen completely nude from the behind granted that there is no intense nudity in the film it is something which could very easily have been left out without having the film lose anything i found it to be just another unnecessary piece added in to give the film more of a bada edge and help support the r rating one final aspect of the film which did not impress me was the choice of james mcavoy for the lead actor throughout the course of the film i found myself embarrassed to be watching it because his acting was so weak in the opening action scenes of the film i was so annoyed by his forced emotions and doing a rather poor job at it at that but his character did evolve a little bit by the end he had changed to insisting upon himself obviously wishing that he were the next 007 while i would not want to degrade a great actor like edward norton or brad pitt to this film someone like jason statham may have been an adequate choice over all with the film id have to say that the dialog is very weak the action sequences are cool but over the top by so much that its hard to watch without laughing the character development is nonexistent save for with mcavoys character which somehow manages to go from louis tully to james bond with no real reason the violence is intense and over the top the twist is predictable the ending is predictable the language is unnecessary the sexuality is unnecessary and the acting is weak though freeman and jolie do nothing awful they also by no means have performances that are up to par with previous work i gave the film a 3 because while it is not a good movie by any means it had some moments of entertainment in it but by no means was it enough to warrant anything higher than a 5 if you are interested in this style of film i would suggest seeing equilibrium the departed or donnie brasco peace,fantasy
the effects are great the casts are even better but what really turns me off is the clich partscons 1 clich parts a finding out that your father is actually the one who youre supposed to kill but you were made to believe otherwise b a guy is shot from the behind after the suspense background was soundedc not missing the shot after the real person is used for a decoyd although some people will not agree with this i found the bullets that were shot by cross to kill mr x was out of proportion that will not really happen in real life given the distance is so long and how could you possibly see him on top of the building from your apartments window is just really really out of proportion 2 suspense not really that suspense since it gave away the suspense thing 3 cheesy linespros  but after all these flaws the research and the effects is totally wow  angelina jolies skills mixed with sophistication and grace is a double wowall in all we must give credit to the director for leading this skillful batch of actors and actresses in an action pack filled movie i though that they would stress with the s e x thing but i was actually surprised that they didnt and is a totallyworthspendingyourmoney onit thing,fantasy

well you certainly cant fault for its originality theres all kinds of great action to be seen here and it will satisfy every action fans wildest dreams what i like most about the movie is that it is a massive adrenaline rush which of course is what the movie centers around the action is jaw dropping crazy breathtaking yet not mindless the movies plot albeit progressively unrealistic and unbelievable always remains a factor the scenes are not random and are perfectly contained within the storyline notice i said storyline not reality timur bekmambetov is the master of action as evidenced by the night watch films and this action masterpiecethe actingof course its an action movie and its based on a graphic novel so i wasnt expecting much here the acting wont blow you away but the stars live up to their names james mcavoy is stellar as the geek turned assassin a man who has led a nothing life with no purpose until he meets fox angelina jolie and her fellow assassins led by sloan morgan freeman together they form the fraternity its certainly not mcavoys best performance but he does bring a likable depth to the character and a tinge of badassery to the part at the end of the film i enjoyed jolies performance the most in the film theres a certain subtlety to it that doesnt show itself until the end and youll leave saying to yourself thats why shes considered one of the best of her time common and thomas kretschmann add strong showings along with morgan freemans fierce portrayal of sloandont worry too much about the writing the film gets cheesy at many points but that is the point bekmambetov knows this and he continually hits us with mind blowing and crazy action i was left stupefied multiple times during the film the film opens and ends with a bang theres car chases sniper shots shootouts ingenuity finesse and even some stealthy action i really enjoyed bekmambetovs work on this moviethe supreme unbelievability of the movie does detract a bit but its not like the filmmakers could have changed this what makes it unbelievable its part of the story and essential to the plot is a sleek sexy action packed and wonderful thriller film to offset all the superhero films of late,fantasy
had a lot going for it but lost track of that by trying to make a more actionpacked matrix ripoff the beginning of the movie is what captures the audiences attention by portraying the life of the main character that we can all relate to unsatisfactory job unsatisfactory relationship and unsatisfactory life where the movie really goes wrong is failed logic too many illogical assumptions that that audience has to buy into in order to follow the storyline some examples theres no logical reason bullets can suddenly curve at the minds will at least in the matrix there was a solid justification to anything out of the ordinary ie the matrix wasnt the real worldthe ending in my opinion is a cheap shot talking to the audience firsthand because they couldnt do it properly in the movie if the message of movie cant be figuredout by the audience yelling at them through the main character is only making it worse in conclusion there were a lot of great sequences in this movie and its always fulfilling when you feel you can relate to the main character but the absolute irrational physicsdefying action stuff just made me lose touch with the movie,fantasy
this is my first review as i saw the film on tv last night and couldnt get over the massive lack of imagination in the script it reminds me of a high school film project except its had far too much money thrown at it for some unapparent reason the film is basically a poor mans matrix with some dark humour if it can be called that james mcavoy is essentially neo an office worker who doesnt understand his place in the world and is sought out by some badass woman with some knowledge of his character who protects him and takes him to a leader of a group of people whom vows to train mcavoy to become a master assassin meaning he can ultimately brake the laws of physics there are of course some differences in the plot from this point but the similarities are ridiculous morgan freemans character even talks in the same way as morpheus and slow motion has never seemed so unnecessary other problems with this film are the countless plot holes that leave you hugely distracted from the filmfirstly mcavoys character is all torn up about murdering one man then later in the film he is responsible for the death of hundreds of innocent train passengers and doesnt bat an eyelid secondly morgan freeman is supposedly a master assassin and yet in the final scene of the film he walks over to someone who looks a bit like james mcavoy from behind in the middle of an office and says something witty before going to shoot him not even noticing that he is stood on a rather large yellow x made of postit notes which you would assume he would be aware of from the other side of the room it was like the writer just to put in the sniper bullet tracking shot ripped straight from the freak on a leash video by korn and didnt care if the plot made any sense the ridiculous character flaws go on throughout the film but those two were particularly irritating the film was gratuitous in its action sequences each one insanely repetitive and the clichs made them very predictablethe one decent thing about this film was the fact that we could laugh at it its just about watchable and ridiculous enough to be funny the paychecks must have been big for this film as i dont see how that script would appeal to the likes of morgan freeman,fantasy

this review contains spoilers but i ll try to limit them as best as i cani hear this movie is based on a cartoon for the cartoons sake i hope the movie took liberties story wise because the story of this movie is awful no actually awful is an understatement but you get the ideathe movie is about an ordinary guy who gets unexpectedly invited to join a cult of assassins which has apparently existed for several thousand years the special secret power of those assassins is that they can fire bullets from a gun like a curve ball or like a top spin shot in tennis which in essence lets them shoot around cornersbut it gets worsein the course of the movie we learn about the beginnings of this cult of assassins the founders of the group were just ordinary people they had discovered that a certain device in their daily work they were not assassins yet did not work as well as they hoped there were anomalies which they decided had to be coded messages and sure enough they cracked the code and what that device was feeding them were namesmaybe we can be inclined to follow that plot development but how can we explain that the conclusion these people drew from receiving names was that they had to kill them why not send them flowers or invite them to lunch apparently these assassins believe that if the person on their list does not get killed far greater evil will come into this world how can they possibly come to that conclusion the people they kill are perfectly innocent by the time they die the killers assume however that something the victim would have done in the future would have caused harmwhy do the assassins claim to know this have they tried all the other options as well flowers lunchthe movie does not explain this but what makes it worse the young recruit does not ask he just joins and quickly gets to the point where he kills without questionthe movie has some plot twists none of which are surprising and ends in a showdown which is easily the most ridiculous scene of the movieit is for that reason that i would advise you to sit through this movie just for laughs that is if you can stomach the utter stupidity of the story,fantasy
yes this is a disturbing film disturbing that something so absurd made 135342 million domesticww box office on a 75 million budget it really bothers me when something i hate is wildly successful so like all old dorks i will write it off to young people today young people today like movies written for sexually frustrated 14yearold boys this movie is essentially a fps firstperson shooter video game made into a movie so the real deal is they have to make some implausible story to allow the male lead to go on a killing spreethe movie shows some sad indications of the american male teen psyche1 they hate their mcjob well why didnt he have the sales report done the slacker maybe if he would make his deadlines he would be treated better better by the boss2 they think cars make up for bad personalty you can almost hear the millions of them thinking in unison if i had a read ferrari i could bang angelina jolie3 they want to kill people the whole premise of the movie reminds me of the sniper in the jerk you know the one that utters the forever classic line die you random bastard so this is a movie tailored to murderous psychopaths and it made 342 million dollars that does not count the rentals or tv syndication you can see why i am disturbed it is hardly worth looking at all the plot holes and implausibility why should he care about his nonexistent dad in fact whey should we care about any of these clowns the bogus dream scene at the very beginning means the whole thing is called into question there is absolutely no way to discern reality from his stupid teenage dreams this may be some attempt at grand existential philosophy on the part of the filmmakers but it is a violation of basic storytelling this complements the violations of the basic laws of physics bending bullets give me a break when his dad was laying in a pool of blood you think he would have taken a swab so he could check the story at his local paternity clinicfather never you in the fraternity he you in a deadend job with a fat slob boss how about sending him to yale or better yet a wharton mba double mind twists jeeze oh pete could someone please keep the good guys good and the bad guys bad i am tired of switching sides seeing angelina jolie blow her own brains out was nice she has bass lips and that always bothered me she deserved to die die random bastress i am writing this realtime but i am sure angelina will spring back to life who are all the tinypeter teen boys going to vank off to if she is dead ahhh credits role thank god what a lame movie and worse yet it is a shocking depiction how lame the young boys of the planet are ok space aliens we are a bunch of effete mambypamby jackwagons who get sad when we see yellow time to exterminate this race and try a different dna sequencei loved the imdb review that said this movie made crank look like the godfather in case there are some gullible and easilyinfluenced teen boys that only rave about this movie since they thing they are supposed to sorry boys i have worked as a mob soldier and hung around outlaw motorcycle clubs badass tough guys dont go for this type of crap they watch ever after  a cinderella story 1998 ill be reviewing that nextgratuitous r lee ermey reference,fantasy
this was another great movie with angelina jolie she is super hot in this one and plays a great wild and sexy characteri very much enjoyed the writers take on the office environment the boss and cubicle mess i think we have all experienced that working situation beforethe movie is full of action and cool stunts  effects you never get bored watching itthe movie also contains twist that one may not expect either its interesting to see how sides are chosen when the truth comes out the music really helps build up the scenes too great sound track,fantasy
right from the onset i was enthralled by it is one of the most explosive action movie i have ever seenis a story about a loser wesley gibson james mcavoy who works with a firm as an accountant his life is hell and nothing seems to be going right with him he is on antianxiety pills and is also harassed by his grumpy boss who keeps irritating him with a stapler and loads of work he is such a miserly person that together with his best friend his girl friend is cheating on him but one day his life takes a new leaf when he is rescued by fox angelina jolie who happens to be a member of the fraternity a secret society of trained assassins she rescues him from a rogue assassin cross thomas kretschmann who wants to kill him cross has also allegedly killed wesleys father who was one of the assassins at the fraternityis a film with a lot of twists  turns its thrilling narration will keep you absorbed in the movieit is a suspense thriller with bloody action sequences the cinematographer of the movie uses a lot of computer generated effects to give the thrills to the moviethe movie was also nominated for 2 oscars for best sound editing  best sound mixing its a cruel irony that it lost out the awards to slumdog millionaire in my view the guys at the sound department did a flawless job in delivering some of the best sounds ever made for a movie the sound mixing was awesome  added the necessary juice required for an action movie the heart pumping background score really sent shivers down my heartperformance wise going james mcavoy was surely the show stealer of the movie i have always been amazed by his expressions morgan freemans role was small but important i hope he gets some longer roles in future his talent needs to be given more onscreen time in order to really get a feel of what he has in store with him angelina jolie was awesome in her role the rest of the cast did a fair job toooverall is a nice  sleek action movie it will surely remind you of the matrix series although its much more violent go enjoy yourself out httpmuditsoodinfoarticles,fantasy
this is a lot of fun the films plot is wildly implausible and its action explosive like something out of a comic book james mcavoy plays a likable guy trapped in a mundane office job with a cheating girl friend a boss from a hell and a smarmy best friend enter angelina jolie and mcavoys life is changed for ever theres a clever plot twist towards the end which i didnt guess it makes mcavoy reassess everything thats been happening to him morgan freeman is solidly dependable while jolie is enigmatic and deadly there is too much violence and the film is overlong still very much watchableoverall 710,fantasy
this movie insults your and my intellect this movie is horrible bad and dissents all law of physics and logics dont watch it if you are older than three demand your money back at ticket office and dont pay it loud for dvd or bluray what the hell is the cause for playing in this fairy tales for imbecile children for morgan freeman is he no more interested to play in good movies or he doesnt become more good roles i dont know it but this plant is the worst  by a mile that i have seen in the last 2 years great growth of the form above the substance hands offon the index of 1 to 10 it is 10,fantasy
this is a very cool fast paced action movie its got a great star who is relatable to before he becomes a super killer it has great side characters sloan and fox who are awesomely played by freeman and jolie it has very cool action scenes and uses slomotion at the right moments if you have read the book like me you will not find this predictable because it has some great twist that werent from the book my only problems with the movie are 2 things one i was left wanting more at the end i felt they should have had a battle between sloan and wesley also at 2 parts of the movies i felt the movie was choppy cutting a scene to early like when wesley wakes up in his bed believing meeting the faternity was a dream how did he get back home also after that train scene and wesley falls to the ground how did tarrence stamp get him and bring him to his dads apartment so there are some minor problems in the movie but it is really just a very fun cool movie,fantasy
is partly based on a comic book and let me tell you about the comic its a far out foul language and generally buttawful scifisuperhero thing with multiple dimensions and aliens in it and costumed villains who have defeated all the heroes the fraternity are total bad guys killers and rapists apathy prevails and there aint no loomthe movie therefore while not great is a vast improvement over the misanthropic comic they introduced the loom of fortune in order to turn the fraternity into a sort of good guys who only kill people who would go on to cause death and disaster if they were allowed to live coupled with a preternatural ability to curve bullets and maneuver cars and other equipment this is actually a neat action concept the loom is supernatural and perhaps an act of god but if you accept that it is in some uncanny way always right then the basic premise is not bad with welldirected action scenes this could be turned into a really cool franchiseor perhaps the correct wording is could have been because they already messed it up in the first movie two basic plot elements served to ruin this movie dragging it down from something quite cool to something totally mediocre1 the beatings as in the comics our movie protagonist had to undergo severe beatings in order to become part of the fraternity now this may be believable though still deeply repulsive if the fraternity are total bad guys as in the comic but it makes zero sense when the fraternity as in the movie are good guys none whatsoever and its all the more disgusting for being so meaningless2 the fact that sloan turns out to be a bad guy its bad enough that its awfully clich to have the guy at the top be corrupt but whats worse is it violates the whole principle of the loom of fortune if sloan were destined to go bad then the loom should have ordered his assassination before he ever became leader of the fraternity if the loom is always right then it cant make these kinds of mistakes it doesnt make sensea third and more minor complaint is that the trailer showed our protagonist and angelina jolies character getting together with a piece of dialog where jolies character says do you want to that part has however been completely excised from the movie when is hollywood getting its act together with trailers what the hell is the sense of including bits that arent in the final movie harumphstill its a quite entertaining movie the plot of which actually works most of the time8 out of 10,fantasy
i gave the movie a 2 out of 10 for the unand useless and unneeded sexual content and offensive language the plot was great i would have enjoyed the movie much much more without the sexual content and offensive language the actors in this movie deserve better than to have to stoop to the language and sex in scripts these days i am a big fan of films like the matrix that are science fiction futuristic and actionpacked this film definitely is actionpacked in my opinion and keeps you on the edge of your seat just when i thought i had the plot figured outand i just knew what would happen next bami was totally blown away this film could in my opinion be rewritten cleaner for a much more enjoyable experience,fantasy
enough is enough from this moment on i declare war on hollywoods infatuation with slow motion the matrix revolutionized the technique nearly a decade ago and in the years since has literally taken the industry hostage it became an epidemic with 300 and now theres a textbook definition of excess and a film thats more annoying than entertainingan aggravating attack on the senses takes an interesting and potentially promising concept and weighs it down with a heavy handedness you cant prepare for in fact timur bekmambetovs style of direction may very well be a direct testament to this generations perpetual short attention span for while there are countless action sequences adequately mindless and feverishly overthetop each one becomes less thrilling and more predictable than the last follows a simple formula and never strays but in the end that comes back to hurt itbut above all else just isnt a very likable movie the amount of skill involved in the project is undeniable everything is executed with precision and glamor but i didnt like the hyperactive camera angles i didnt like the aforementioned use of slow motion which became groan inducing after only a few minutes i didnt like the ridiculous dialogue james mcavoys narration most of all and if i never have to see mcavoy scream in slow motion again ill die happymakes numerous stabs at putting together a coherent story each of them unsuccessful some mumbo jumbo about fate and an array of ludicrous twists thatll get eyes rolling in the last twenty minutes it all seems so uninvolving and contrived i would have preferred if hadnt even pretended that the likes of angelina jolie and morgan freeman were anything but props bad ass props but dumb props nonetheless because when the last bullet is fired what were left with is little more than another empty hollywood lackluster thats all style and no substance surprise surprisemore reviews rottentomatoescomvinejournalviewphpjournalid219276viewpublic,fantasy
timur bekmambetovs first american film isnt that far removed from the kinetic hyperactive and sometimes just plain fing batty movies night watch and day watch its about the fraternity of assassins who get their missions from clues hidden in a giant quilt i guess and its also about wesley james mcavoy a regular whitecollar worker and his strange dark adventure of selfdiscovery in this fraternity of who he really is an instinctual almostmutant killing machine meant for revenge by his mentor morgan freeman who thankfully is a villain for once in a great whilewhat is there to say about this then well its never boring at least as far as i could tell i never did nod off that being said it makes last years shoot em up look like a documentary in comparison and this isnt necessarily a good thing a movie might be totally crazy with the overthetop manners of killing people in this one we get bullets that curve bullets that hit one another heart rates reaching 400 bps and rats who bomb the joint reminding one of the armed penguins in batman returns but does it make it a really good movienot in this case im afraid this is a shame since james mcavoy is a very good actor one whos very convincing funny and believable even when put in the most unbelievable circumstances he practically carries the first third of the film on his own this despite him being put in a totally crazy car chase that continues some of the readytobreak rules set up here by bekmambetov and theres even some good star power with jolie acting like big action star angelina jolie and freeman in a part too easily readable for his own good but by the end were given a plot and choice in technical style that knocks off matrix fight club la femme nikita a slew of john woo movies two turtle doves and a pear tree unpartriaged and the last quarter of the film is just escalating laughoutloud madness that skids the line between suspenseful and totally ludicrous and eventually falls over the latter sidewould i recommend no i wouldnt at least if youre paying for yourself but if youre invited go along and take a chance youll leave a little shellshocked but you might not be totally sorry you went well might,fantasy
i do not understand how any logical person can find this film i am being nice entertaining the movie viewing public has only ourselves to blame when it comes to hollywood and them release crap like over the top action scenes with totally unbelievable stunts the characters are not even likable which may have given me something to appreciate i can suspend belief in scifi and other genres but is just crap in my humble opinion obviously i am in the minority here with this movie receiving a 77 rating my guess the a jolie lovers are giving the high marks for this socalled entertainment,fantasy
im amazed at the reviews of this movie these reviews are not just good reviews they are astounding reviews is this what weve come to really perhaps after 3 months of comic book style action movies people are just happy to see graphic violence and willing to overhype a movie simply based on the amount of bullets shot through someones skull this movie was not groundbreaking it sounds like people need to watch more movies ill give a fair criticism of the film now the acting was all over the place it was good where youd expect it to be good and uncomfortable where youd expect it to be uncomfortable james was excellent his transformation was believable and that is the only reason this film can stand on its own as a serious movie as opposed to a graphic bmovie if otherwise led by a horrible actor jolie is losing her touch shes not terrible but she adds absolutely nothing to the movie not even sex appeal which was their goal as she is in most of the previews and her character gets way more screen time than necessary for the story freeman used to be flawless in his choices but after unleashed and now im starting to wonder the guy can obviously act but i honestly think rick moranis could have pulled this role offthe storyline had potential but they ruined any credibility with their continuous dialogue beating us over the head with the reasons their world existed tell me this according to the movie freemans character explains that fate is the reason they kill a slightly more detailed explanation is in the film but fate seems to cover it however a few scenes later freeman tells mcavoy that he is in control not in control of the fate factor that job is left to a large knitting machine that doesnt follow the fate logic very closely does it and the real kicker in the movie is another line that freeman says while explaining to mcavoy why his character can kill with the best of them freeman says something along the lines of you can kill because of an extreme amount of adrenaline pumping through your body that only a few people in the world have not only that but what mcavoy thought were panic attacks turned out to be those adrenaline rushes that allow him to kill where to start right first of all adrenaline rushes do not give you the ability to leap tall buildings secondly if everyone that had panic attacks really suffered from assassininducing adrenaline rushes then wouldnt a lot of people in the world have it dont take this as just tearing the movie apart and please dont say its just a movie idiot you have to suspend disbelief i dont like suspending my disbelief because i dont think you should have to if the movie has properly set up the story and creates a world in itself then the viewer can enter that world created then they dont have to suspend their disbelief because the world in the movie explains any disbelief you might have the last thing ill say about the storyline is the use of the bending the bullet thing what an arrogant way to popularize your movie when you hear people say bending the bullet they are not simply naming a secret assassination technique from the movie they are actually quoting the movie the film itself in a very cocky way literally says bend the bullet nearly 10 times the fact that the movie names its own ploy in their marketing campaign is very unsettling to menow the direction i just didnt like it some shots were good some scenes were very well done example the shootout at the end of the movie was exciting and violent and everything youd expect from a movie like this but overall the films pace was annoying and the editing was sloppy in places also a good action movies needs more than two locations for action in this film we had 1 a moving train and 2 the fraternitys hideout thats really not enoughi dont think this film is horrible by any means its a good enough movie to rent when youre bored on a saturday afternoon and want some action but i cant stand these rave reviews this film is getting this new russian director has a lot of potential but i feel like he along with most firsttime american movie foreign directors follows the american cs of filmmaking get as many cuts and cusses in there as possible and people will like the moviebottom line  wait until it hits the cheap theaters to see this overhyped actioner and please dont fall for these ridiculous reviews that the studios need so badly since jolie and freeman both added their names to the cast the only redeeming quality is james mcavoy who really will make a great action star if he plays his cards right,fantasy
i gave this movie 1 star only because some of the special effects are good though all of them are now time worn and thoroughly wornout in moviedom how many more people on wires and slowmo  john woo effects do we the public have to suffer through before hollywood starts making good movies again the acting was in short awful then again i have no particular liking for angelina without a doubt the most overrated actress ever i am a fan of morgan freeman but i guess morgan like ed mcmahon must really be behind on his mortgage and really needed the paycheck from this productionapparently if you want a vehicle that goes fast do not waste your money on a customized viper just buy a 20 year old holsum bread van and put a bunch of bobbleheads on the dashthis movie is strictly an extremely crappy ripoff of star wars luke im your father the matrix and the fight clubi could include tons of spoilers here based on the ridiculousness of this movie but you already know all of them if youve watched the movies mentioned abovefor gawds sake have some sense and if youre over 12 years old physically or mentally do not waste your money or more importantly your valuable time watching this work of garbage,fantasy
there is something about this film that makes it not quite the most ridiculous awful film you could watch its a fun romp with some great names and interesting cast who were made for action films everything else is just awful you could write the script 10 seconds before the characters speak the writing is that obvious i never liked matrix but at least matrix bothered to explain why people could do impossible actions by taking outside a physical world this writer and director would have you just believe some people are just really duhawsome its not possible to write a spoiler on this film trust me its so clichd you have seen this film under every action film imaginable if this film did not have effects and budget it would be the biggest embarrassment to some distinguished careers if it wasnt for the violencekids would love it if your over eight years of age you might want something a little more substantial to watch,fantasy
this is the first comment ive written for a movie i just saw the movie on opening night with my girlfriend and we both loved it were both 17 so for a teenager id say its a good movie to go toi watch a lot of movies and not man blockbuster films and i like pretty much any kind of movie or i at least give them a shot i read reviews that this movie was the matrix with humor but just a few of the special effects reminded me of the matrix but otherwise not that much although i can see how people compared characters in with the matrixbut i didnt even think about that during the moviei recommend this movie for everyone to go see even adults the humor in it is funny and makes the movie seem a little less serious which is goodtrust me the only thing i didnt like about this movie wont give anything away dont worry was when angelina and mcavoy are the train at night the green screening makes it look kind of fake and that just bugs me with movies but it defiantly didnt effect how amazing this movie was the special effects were stunning the plot was pretty good and the script wasnt terrible go and see it if your looking for a good movie to see,fantasy
this is a must see movie  this beautifully orchestrated storyline and mind blowing effects is played out with a precision rarely seen in movies todayit is the masterful direction of timur bekmambetov and the superior cast including james mcavoy morgan freeman and angelina jolie that allow this sophisticated story to unfold with unsurpassed perfectionwith all the action drama and edge of your seat suspense this movie lacks nothing with its ability to pull you inside and keep you therethe twists and turns in this amazing plot keep you on the edge and guessing beyond the end of the movieif you do nothing for yourself the rest of the summer see this movie and realize that you can have the maximum amount of adrenaline course through your veins and survive,fantasy
i saw a midnight showing of this movie last night and absolutely loved it 1000 thumbs up james mcavoy delivers a stupendous performance along with angelina jolie and morgan freeman its incredible action and special effectsi wish this movie would be nominated for best performance by jamesmorgan and angelina and especially for best visual and special effects but i dont know because its kind of comparing it to the matrix but also not really and at the time they dominated the whole year when they came outbut i highly highly highly recommend anyone and everyone to see this movie its got its humor also and very funny mite i add,fantasy
i have no idea why people are actually giving this movie 10 out of 10 it looks like there are far too many people with vested interests that are trying to skew the voting do you really think this deserves 10 out of 10 no waythis movie was terrible clichd hollywood with predictable plot twists and average by todays standards special effects the plot is ridiculous and i actually laughed out loud at the film on more than one occasioni actually registered today to try to spare those that were thinking about seeing this below average film dont waste your time or money  it will be on the tv in a year or soit was a coin toss between and the incredible hulk  which i have heard is much better than the first how unlucky was i410,fantasy
i dont get this film to be honest having received so much praise and attention from the media i felt compelled to check it out what a waste of 2 hours the highlight was when nine inch nails appeared on the soundtrack a few minutes into me this seemed like it was heavily influenced by the incredible fight club a film which most people will agree was fantastic this however had a completely ridiculous plot line lame acting i really dont like james mcavoy and corny action scenes dont get me wrong i love a good action film and senseless violence can be great if done properly but in it was done very badlyi thought i was the only way that felt this way but after much searching i found many people that share my opinion how this got so much i attention ill never know maybe because of morgan freemananywayas i mentioned earlier to me this film seems like a rip of off fight club what with the inner monologues the journey the main character goes through and the way the action was directed that was done very badly i couldnt stop thinking james mcavoy was trying to copy edward nortonthis film gets two stars purely because morgan freeman was in it and it had nin on the soundtrack thats it i urge people with a decent film taste to steer well clear of this however if you like useless plot lines and corny action scenes be my guest,fantasy
the most surprising aspect of this movie is that morgan freeman would lend his talents to such a bomb filled with gratuitous violence and based on one of the silliest plots ever devised this movie somehow manages to be boring and revolting at the same time the film makers seem to believe that there is some correlation between entertainment and the amount of blood smeared james mcavoy a good actor has his character subjected to numerous beatings any one of which would easily kill a normal human being he survives by seemly dipping his head in white chocolate and then lying in a cold water bath angelina joli who has a proved record as an actor seems bored through most of the movie even while she is inflicting brutal punishment on mcavoy although almost every character in the movie is alternatively a villain and then a hero the real villains are the producers of this lame excuse for a film,fantasy
i was able to catch this movie for free and thank god i didnt spend money on this basically the director from night watch slows it down a bit just a bit and makes a cheesy bland action flick about a guy who joins the fraternity a secret group of assassins now me i have a special place in my heart for assassins rogues cat burglers snipers and sneaky marginalized heroes of all types so i understand that its really a matter of taste when i say i didnt care much for the type of worldsaving assassin that flips cars and blows up trains shown in this film on the other hand i dont think its a matter of taste when i say that its stupid to watch a movie where a guy walking across the street gets the same stylistic cutting and zoomsound editing as a guy trying to pick off a target from a moving train night watch was frustrating because its most beautiful images and thus basically the reason to watch the film were cut away merely for stylistic effect at least has some images that you can linger on and enjoy but they ultimately begin to drag under poor stylistic direction and of course a pretty ridiculous storylineanother thing is the concept behind the curving bullets me i can accept such an idea in a movie of this type because its not so much trying to be real as its trying to provide a neat new approach to action and the movie does at least bother to explain it somewhat which is nice but what with all the other things that happen in this movie one discovers that what those characters are using are not guns guns dont shoot out knives that got jammed up their barrel they backfire guns dont bend barrels around corners and then have the bullet follow the path of the barrel they backfire guns cant be held like a friggin baseball they have this thing known as kickback theres only so far things like that can go before what youre watching is not a gun battle but honestly just a really boring exposition of some guy magically making all of his opponents die without a scratch and thats not exciting tense or really much of anything because theres no drama in it i mean really all the jumpcuts in the world dont replace the need for some logical foil in plot to give our intrepid hero something to strive against and besides in a world where people believe the da vinci code is real 10000 bc is an historical exploration into our past and the selective trivia of national treasure has any true referent in our nations history i cant help but wonder how many stupid people are actually going to try this curving bullet thing ultimately theres a lot of really good movies out there right now and its hard for me to imagine why anyone would really want to go see this one instead oh wait it does have a shot of angelina jolies butt and for better or for worse morgan freeman is always an interesting actor oh and well all of the office scenes work for a sort of followup to office space style humour and catharsis but basically all of that exposition is in about the first half of the movie so once the unearned twist in the plot occurs about twothirds in youll pretty much know all of the plot you need to know and seen all of the images you need to see and you can leave therepolarisdib,fantasy
what a waste of film how come these actors even bother with this crap angelina jolie would have been worth watching if it werent for the fact she looks like a anorexic crackwhorejesus christ most of action seems to have been done by a 14 year old kid on his dads pcnot a single iota of plausibility in this pile of sht the director should be shot along with studio execs who green lighted thismorgan freeman shouldve know bettermakes the matrix look like a merchant ivory masterpieceif its not the worst movie ever its the next best thing,fantasy

really a 70 out of 10 by thousands of people never mind clich and predictable but how about just plain ridiculous i dont mind science fiction or superhero movies but this was neither but still had impossible elements of both genres a gun is gun bullets dont bend for anyone and this is just one of the many many ridiculously impossible things that you have to believe can happen to buy into this movie i do not believe that a movie needs to be 100 realistic to be enjoyable but at least give the audience a reason for the things that happen that are not realistic as is the case with a science fiction or superhero movie how can anyone watch two bullets cancel each other out in mid air time after time and think oh this is a great action movie for my money a movie needs to establish a good reason for supernatural occurrences just because a persons father was an assassin does not mean that they can shoot the wings off of a fly the 1st time they handle a gun,fantasy
there was an angie before and after girl interruptedbone collector before was a great actress for miniseries but very bad for movies after gitbc was the great femele choice for action flicks the main trouble was almost all sucks and none was a masterpiece well the bc and g i werent either and her dramas and comedies were bad and her performance even worse even i dislike her in the too hate or too love performance of a mighty hard finally i thought that jolie was one of the most overrated actresses and one of the worst but finally ive seen a good vehicle for her not only but also a good movie too she acts like a reptile and looks wonderful and strong her costar are equally good james mcavoy is the perfect nerd turn hero and morgan freeman and thomas krestchmann as ambiguous assesins are great too in fact a very good movie with some social contious material that fix well lot of humour and a fantastic finish,fantasy
this film is a fabulous action entertainer a bit of free violence of course with a slight pathetic story at some point but the action scenes were top indeedthe blockbuster i was expecting is very tolerable even better than my expectationsuntil the last scene that last scene ruins completely the film i mean its so basic removes the few substance the movie had at all theres no message i felt the whole movie was for retards no substancei was completely disappointed ruins everything,fantasy
i saw the trailers like everybody else that were run up and down the block the big thing was the curving bullets and the assassin son rightofpassage bit i gathered it was a newkind of matrixstyle effects film i guess somewhat in that sense the film delivered but the first five minutes had me surprised at the cheaptrick hype of vulgarity usage another half hour in and i thought okay this is like shoot em up except no clive owen another fifteen minutes later as the plot unravels angelina jolie isnt goodlooking enough to overcome disinterest in the film and lastly im thinking wow at least shoot em up came off as an action farce all you had to do was just sit back laugh and watch the bullets fly attempts to delve into a complex plot amid action and drama but the drama fails to deliver and things only get corny toward the end after seeing morgan freeman last week in bucket list and respecting his reputation as an actor i was surprised he signed on james mcavoys performance in last king of scotland only makes this film look like he decided to go on acting vacation and angelina joliewell expect more tomb raider without the accent it seems like too many actors with potential are getting role happy these days what film will jason statham show up in next,fantasy
i expected this film to be the type of movie that showed the best bits in the adverts and left you with nothing but filler to watch but i was wrong from the first few minutes the film had action and it never seemed to stop jolie makes killing look easy and coolnot sure thats a good thing in real life but hey this is film and fiction after all mcavoy did a good job with us accent and was far better at the action than i expected if youre looking for heartfelt drama or oscar worthy acting dont go to see this and then moan this is a film for people who like to go the cinema and just enjoy themselves and yes its far fetched but so what its loads of fun toothe last few times ive been the cinema ive come away disappointed the films i saw were either garbage or i could have enjoyed just as much sitting at home on dvdand paid less for popcorn but films like this were made for cinema they are loud fast overwhelm the senses and are hugely entertaining this is the type of film ill end up buying on dvd to watch again and again when i want a film that i can switch off to and just thoroughly enjoy,fantasy
i admit that after seeing only one preview on tv i was pretty excited for this movie my friends saw it before me one of them reluctantly and then proceeded to harass me for a full week to go and see it as well as soon as possible theyd never done that before so i thought the film must be phenomenalits really notif i were to pitch this film i would say its shoot em up meets the matrix but with all the corny ridiculousness of the first and none of the unique possibilities possessed by the latter tries to to outdo every action film in existence but it tries too hard i enjoyed some of the action the bending bullets knifeplay and overthetop car chases in particular were all very entertaining and unique but mixed with the needless blood and seemingly endless cascade of slow motion hold ups i found myself yawning and shifting uncomfortably in my seatthe language too seemed only to be there to make it especially crude the main characters boss curses so much im surprised no ones reported hertheres caricatures stereotypes violence blood and language galore but that isnt what got to me im a huge fan of graphic novels and some of their movie adaptations but a good one this was not it might have been had the writers put in a little more effort but as it is i found myself almost lazily catching the light foreshadowed hints and predicting every plot twist well before you were finally flung around the bendthe plot itself is much too reminiscent of the matrix and star wars with even a little boondock saints thrown in but while all of those films had a unique message to deliver this one did not it seemed to want to try and teach you something about yourself very much like fight club but without any real connection between the audience and the character being flung around on screenand then there was the loom of fate er all of the assassins ended up listening to a contraption so ridiculous that i found myself struggling not to roll my eyes instead of the grand underground antipolitical free masonesquire society they could have been if thered been other fantastic elements to the film then sure maybe i could have accepted that as it was but to throw in something so completely unrealistic into an otherwise normal and mundane world was a bad move they didnt even link it to the threads of fate found in greek legend which i was sure even after hearing their weak attempt at an explanation it must have been based off of without any type of real mythological or legendary history the audience was asked to dumbly believe that this ancient ultracool band of seasoned hardened warriors the doomed dregs of mankind who are forced to suffer and kill so that the rest of us can live free take their orders from a magical allknowing threadspinner and that this is perfectly normal logical and rational the fact that they formed 1000 years ago because they deciphered a language that didnt exist until a few decades ago doesnt seem to matter in the leastthe characters too were lacking james mcavoys scottish accent crept out every now and then and he literally went from sniveling paperpusher to raging rebel in the span of a few minutes angelina jolie looked the part but her history was ultimately clich and unsatisfying no one showed enough personality or revealed enough history for you to really care about what happened to them by the end im of the opinion that if theyd have cut some of the slowmo and lengthened gunshot scenes and focused instead on character development and interaction it could have been really greatlooking back on it from the perspective of a graphic novel i find i can swallow a bit more of the unreal atmosphere but they should have marketed it like that instead of proclaiming it to be a hot action flick the bourne identity and the matrix are regarded as masterpieces because they brought something new to the table while simultaneously maintaining a coherent believable intriguing storyline and characters spiderman batman superman the incredible hulk iron manthe unrealistic nature of these films is automatically swept aside by the knowledge that theyre based on comic books and are therefore supposed to be overly dramatic and filled with stereotypical characters language and action sequences theyre what make up the entire genre fell short because it pretended to be a real boy instead of the comical overcinematized comic book adaptation that it wasgood for some mindless action and crazybullet fun but useless if youre looking for anything more intellectual than as ive already mentioned shoot em up i would recommend equilibrium if youre looking for another open your eyes analysis of human nature human suffering or human discontent its slower but the story is there alongside and complimenting the action which is the one thing really failed to fuseunless was supposed to be an overthetop farce of the entire matrixfight club genre then i would say that if you can keep yourself from trying to take anything in it seriously it succeeds,fantasy
great job timur russian director with rususa team made a great russianamerican movie and proved that the rususa mix in cinema could be a good thing mcavoy and jolie did a great job great acting look at jolies reaction after mcavoy takes the gun and try to escape from this crazy place im sure stanislavsky said i believe from the sky at this moment special effects are awesome its not hollywood spef its timurs original style with spef looks beautiful the story i think is a mix from matrix and fight club but its ok its not about plagiarism its about parody hope timur will do hollywood again 1010,fantasy
i like angelina jolie and i like highaction adventure films especially if they deal with secret societies thats what the first 5 stars are for but for me there was one element missingjudging by the fancy cars driven and the size of the young assassins bank account fate must have deep pockets so  where did the money come from to pay for all this and i dont just ask this in reference to the films present circumstances but in light of the fraternitys long history inquiring minds like mine want to knowbut i gave the film one more star because its possible i took the film totally out of context my theory its possible that this film was much simpler in its premise this could be the story of a loser who is so psychotic that he invented this macho dream world of assassins and secret societies to prop up his nonexistent selfesteem there were two hints of thispossible spoiler if im right1 near the beginning of the film we know that the guy has been prescribed a psychoactive drug to relieve anxiety  implying that he might be a psychiatric outpatient2 near the end of the film he visits an atm machine  and it appears his bank account is back to zero if it ever really was better than zero in the first place and immediately afterward his body is mysteriously transported from the atm machine right back to his terrible workstation as if the whole movie was a dream sequence and to get out of that situation what does he do he reimagines his invented world in such a way that hes on top again and remember that in the office and in the very last scene the scars of his theoretical ordeal have miraculously disappearedin short it could be that this guy is was and will always be a loser trapped in a world filled with delusions of grandeur that would make the whole film palpable logical and enjoyable  but only if you like films about nut cases suffering from delusions of grandeur i dont,fantasy
i remember seeing previews for this flick in late december and it immediately caught my eye so when it released this weekend i made sure i was there to see it i was not disappointed in this flick at all the plot stood strong throughout and the twist was a good one with the action scenes being aesthetically pleasing to the eyes jolie has few lines the entire movie but her characters presence is stronger than any dialog the rest of the cast performs top notch as well all and all this film is a blast and most likely one of the more original pieces youll see this year 1010,fantasy
this movie looked like it was going to be good but i wasnt expecting it to be that good while there was a couple of sexual scenes i wasnt comfortable with i brought my 16 yr old to the movie the movie was high on energy and excitement with a little plot twist i didnt expect i am a lover of actionadventure movies and i would definitely go see this movie a second timeangelina jolie as fox was perfect i had never heard of actor that played the lead prior to this movie but i will definitely pay him more attention i highly enjoyed their acting and the fight scenes were choreographed quite welli highly recommend seeing this movie,fantasy
before i knock this movie i have to admit the special effects were pretty awesome and some of the shots in the film were really nice particularly how the director captured the anxiety of the main character in the scenes at work and the main character wesley did an okay job he reminded me of a homeless mans edward nortonhowever i do not understand why so many people are going nuts over this movie it really wasnt that good i tried to stick with the movie after a awesomely entertaining and catching first 30 minutes but i just could not the plot just continued to get more and more ridiculous i know that you should not expect everything to be realistic when you go to the movies but some things were just to over the top for me for instance the ability to heal in the bath that wasnt thoroughly explained it was just basically a candle wax bath from what i saw and the loom of fate really what does a clothing machine of mystical language have to do with assassinations i know i get the whole weavers thing of assassins but come on the loom of fate that just sounds like a piece of sht 1980s heavy metal band i mean a loom of fate really that just sounds retardedfurthermore i tried giving this movie a shot but the last 45 minutes of the movie dragged on like a root canal the only way i could bare the last few grueling scenes was to treat the movie as a comedy i mean there was two i am your father scenes and morgan freeman turned from a sophisticated man to kill this motherfer in a matter of minutesonce again great effects but if you enjoy movies with at least some substance and reasonably realistic content not worth your time in hindsight probably would have been much better under the influence of some drug or alcohol,fantasy
preemptive warning there is a lot of blood and a moderate amount of swearing in the film so if youre opposed to seeing things like bullets going through heads and rats being blown up veer awaynow having said this my brother and i caught it today and we both loved it from the other reviews we were expecting something more comedic and were a bit confused on that pointit is a bit more comedic than your average action flick yes but dont expect a comedy it is an action flick with a slice of comedy thrown in to get its points across and it employs it wellthe main protagonist one wesley is one of my favorite actors albeit not well known for whatever reason and plays the part rather well jolie and freeman are pretty much as always good so the cast is at least spot on there are a few underdeveloped areas and characters lorewise and a few of the other companions which wesley meets i would liked to have known more about but at 2 hours already i doubt most would sit through a film double that lengthbut the film itself is not terribly much about the character themselves its entertaining with plenty of special effects and eyecandy not to mention some great stunts but the reason i found it so refreshing is that it actually had a punchline to it there was a message and even though i was utterly confused because of my preconceptions for a little while soon i was in the groove and lovin iti wont spoil the ending message because the entire film is a buildup to a single line at the end and its all good stuffcheck it out if youre interested you wont be disappointed,fantasy
i dont know how much more i can elaborate on this except to say that my iq dropped about fifty points after sitting through this movie like a gruesome car wreck though i couldnt pull myself away the only people who should be happy about this film are the ones who made boxing helena because now it no longer has to be the worst movie ever made a few points here 1 morgan freeman how he ended up being in this film 2 james mcavoy needs to go to borders and buy acting for dummies 3 any and all of you who rated this movie over a 110 thus contributing to its woefully overinflatedlikeadeadbody underwaterforthreeweeks 72 rating should be banned from ever speaking again to say nothing of the fact that youre allowed to rate movies imdbs ratings have officially lost all credibility 4 i dont object to violence in moviesafter all i love pulp fictionbut there should be some reason for the over the top violence and gore really im not offended by it except as a person that is offended by stupid movies would be offended 5 i can appreciate movies that are unrealistic after all i love comic book movies as much as the next person but help me out here the story is so ridiculously bad that i to drown myself in a theater toilet after leaving the movie not a spoiler really but if you choose to go see the movie just watch for when angelina is driving alongside the train to see what i mean by over the top ridiculousnessthe only good news is that after seeing this movie i know that life can only get better because that was officially the worst two hours of my life,fantasy
video games are fun theyre a fantasy as deep as fantasy can go where films merely show you exciting and exotic professions video games allow you the magic of interaction involving you to the fullest level possible outside of actually doing it with video games you are given the chance to be a hitman a guitar hero a superstar athlete or the chosen one tasked with saving a fair maiden or an entire world has the dna of a video game but you have to sit and watch someone else playis a film made by men who work tireless empty office jobs watch fight club and office space and fantasize about emulating edward norton and ron livingston these are white men who have a dvd collection full of action movies including perhaps gone in 60 seconds the remake and all three matrix films especially those and have an extensive video game collection including grand theft auto burnout the legend of zelda and max payne these are men who enjoy intense industrial and rapmetal nine inch nails and korn chief among them one day they got home watched the matrix played max payne saw the video for korns freak on a leash and epiphanically said dude the entire mythology of can be unspooled simply by taking a cursory look around their shabby apartments a normal man is informed that he is the chosen one out to avenge his murdered father and is drafted into a secret group of gunwielding revolutionaries that take him from his deadend office job and train him they train him to do amazing things to manipulate time and space specifically in the form of moving and dodging bullets he is tasked with practicing in hand knife and firearm combat in various shall we say levels sometimes he fails no worries he has infinite lives as each time he is injured the narrative merely restarts from a standard save point in this point a sort of bathhouse room with all wounds healed allowing him to try again he is given a set group of tasks where he has to commit various acts of violence upon completion of these tasks and a series of nonactionbased cutscenes he gets closer and closer to his ultimate goal a boss fight if you will there are a few twists and turns and we are taken to exotic locales and have plenty of running car chases and gunplayunfortunately another aspect in which resembles a video game is in its poor acting james mcavoys delivery is unbelievably poor his american accent is solid but he has no range and no believability whatsoever angelina jolie has big fakelookinglips and a gangly strut although if this was a video game her breasts would be substantially larger see tomb raider morgan freeman is the token respectable name slumming and he has such an authoritative voice that he sticks out for commendation even when hes phoning it in the rest of the cast is generic in a way that you couldnt recognize them or care to if they werent live in person in front of younow this is not to say that a film that looks and runs like a video game cant be fun running scared had a gonzo quality that still amounted to a go here and find this plot line and managed to be brilliantly entertaining crank was a bit more empty but had several fantastically silly bits of overthetop action that made you giggle even as you didnt care even jumper salvaged a decent score because its effects were unique and exciting lacks here as well the film has a couple nifty scenes but overall nothing all that fantastic occurs specifically nothing you havent seen in the matrix and the film has so much slowmotion the makers of 300 thought it was overkillas stated its no fun to watch someone else play video games and although they occasionally take your advice dude go back to your apartment and punch that douchebag barry oh sweet i had to go retrieve the gun here anyway thanks bro for the most part they frustrate you with their inability to instantly perform the tasks and the character is sort of whiny and annoying anyway and its just not that much fun especially since youve played so many games like this that were a lot more fun is a mediocre video game and a mediocre film the film apparently did in fact get a video game translation i cant speak for its quality but as a film feels like you rented a game your friend made you watch him play then took it back to the video store without even telling you what a gypgrade 5510 high c  29 of 64 of 2008,fantasy
the haters are right this movie is baaaaaaad and not in the michael jackson sense of bad well on second thoughti must admit the matrix always left me cold as a computer programmer i always thought it was stupid that a guy who didnt even know he was in a computer program was somehow able to outwit the beings who wrote it  inside their own program so it lost my interest for being way too unbelievable and way too complicated i tried to watch it and like it i really did i mean cmon guido the killer pimp is in itof course the matrixs influence has been felt on many films since it was first released but probably none more than the violence in makes the matrix look like little house on the prairie and i finally found something worse than the intricate convoluted unbelievable plot in the matrix the insubstantial onesentence practically missing plot inim going to try to spoil for you for a few reasons 1 the filmmakers dont deserve your money and 2 the marketing team has already spoiled the movie for youthere is nothing substantial in this movie other than what youve seen in commercials and theatrical trailers fox angelina jolie scoops up wesley some guy with a slightlycoolerthantobymaguirebutthatsnotsayingmuch vibe in a viper ridiculous chase ensues foxs vette serves as a ramp for wesleys classic stang he does a barrel roll over an opensunroofed limo and whacks a guy fox drives sovietera sedan into speeding euro train ridiculous derailment over a 2000foot 606meter gorge ensues heres what you didnt see wesley gets revenge on cheating girlfriend and former best friend trains with knives guns and looms takes healing baths kills a few people who have nothing to do with anything misses a big chance to save fox by hitting her bullet with his bullet not a euphemism then kills easy reader the big twist is only an excuse to end this movie exactly when it should be getting started imagine if a james bond movie ended after the opening sequence imagine if rocky trained with giant logs slabs of beef and a screaming nagging wife but never actually fought anybody imagine if ripley had lifted off from the remote space terra farm without going back for newt thats the level of disappointment youll feel when this movie endsvisually the movie is quite impressive especially if you love to play mortal kombat however the abuses of the laws of physics in this film are even more preposterous than the anything goes at least for neo rules in the matrix if theres an oscar for insulting the intelligence of the audience is a lock this movie manages to be as visually impressive and fastpaced as it is cold brutal and utterly pointless for that reason i cant give it a 1 or the just as ubiquitous i wish imdb had a 0 rating i also cant pronounce the directors name but then i cant pronounce m night shyamalan either however i do know something both of their films have in common theyre bleep,fantasy
i miss simple films you know like rear window rope and duel rope and rear window take place in the same room for the most part and duel is pretty much just on the highway but the stories are so powerful that it keeps the viewer hooked and on the edge of their seat now lets talk about a movie that is nothing like those classics in any way shape or form is movie that is so void of anything with substance that the producers tried to cover it up with a bunch of special effects and cuts every two seconds i like to enjoy cinematography in a movie appreciate what kinds of shots are in the film this movie doesnt allow you to do that because the shot changes every few seconds its headache inducing the acting isnt great at all morgan freeman is pretty good but hes literally the only one who seemed to have any idea what he was doing whatsoever angelina jolie is annoying and nondimensional and she added nothing to her character a lot of people have been happy about how james mcavoy is getting leading roles after his portrayal of tumnus in narnia well his role in narnia must have been a fluke because he was terrible in this i think overacting is the word over all i wasnt impressed with the castthe story is totally empty its like the matrix minus a purpose or any form of coherency i really cant say much more about the plot because there really isnt one at all its just a mess of special effects and bad acting with no character developmentthis movie is total crap dont waste your time on it it is nothing more than a ripoff of other films with no storyline to back it up,fantasy
is a decentmade action movie with a mystery waiting to be unfolded by the audiences which will essentially lead the movie to be reflectivedue to my bad habit of making comparisons between a movie and its trailer id like to say it gave me mixed feeling first of all my expectation is too high when i it to be like a topnotch john woo slowmotion flick came out like that but the director is not john woo after all here are the goods and bads about itthe good 1 a solid story excelled my expectation has something to say it is a great fatherson relationship story at first it arouse up the audiences into the mood of brainless killers then subsequently cool them down to let them think the writers are very smart not to ruin the storyline in the gunfires but to develop it into something else i want actions to be driven by story not story driven by actionssaid john woo some years ago is a good example of that2 while brains are kept being blown out the movie kept a balance between a black comedy and a mystery thriller there is no forced romance even though angelina jolie gave many erotic appearances concerning angelina she has to be mentioned as she gave a good performance even with very few lines the rest of the cast is also good morgan freeman deserved a nod absolutely3 the actions the first third of the movie has enough potential to be another matrix but thats also what let me down consequentlythe bad the second part of the movie is halfnarrative halfactionpacked but the third part finally slowed down after the breathtaking train scene the mystery is solved and everyone is waiting for some explosive final shootout but the actions after that are no match for the former parts of the movie what a pity it could have been better than equilibrium it could have been better than so many action classics if it has a better climax maybe its meant to be anticlimaxabout the message of the movie id like to say its an ironic encouragement to everyone who is not satisfied with the environment choose your destiny could be something deceitful and being a good child of the society could be the luckiest thing for you and me710 had some laugh with friends in theater enjoyed it,fantasy
to me was a really decent movie it was really well done and really put together well the cast to me really was entertaining it was the right choice of people to play those parts the story was also a very original and interesting plot to get into hes just a normal person like all of us then he gets in with this fraternity of assassins morgan freeman did an excellent job as well as angeline jolie is definitely a movie that would be good to check out if you and your friends are hanging out and need something to do it really was an entertaining movie the whole thing was full of great cast and great story,fantasy
from four minutes into the film does not slow   from curving bullets to curvaceous women the pace keeps to the highest point almost near the point of run lola run and shoot em up though it does get to be a little too much at times features some of the coolest effects ive seen in an action film since the matrix also the training session at least the first half was cool unfortunately trainingpreparation takes up half the film which to me seemed like far more than enough repetition made for a bit of boredom as did an ending you can see coming from mars   which was a bit of a curse for this film boredom and predictability in an allout action film are probably the worst things you can havebut the impossible overthetop action makes up for it and turns it into a fun summer popcorn flick that isnt entirely brainlessfinal verdict 7510onehalf point was removed for the annoyingly insulting final lineap3,fantasy
was awful i could only get through 5 minutes maybe i turned it off when a guy ran down a hall jumped through a glass window and had a running gun battle come on that was too much bull to take who ever made this movie has to be a video game nut no way does a video game make a good movie i played dungeons and dragons then i watched the movie it stunk to high heaven is a waste of time what ever happened to story or plot visual effects happy people are out of control with movies i dont watch movies for visual effects i watch movies for a story jolie was great in changeling skip and see her that movie,fantasy
i do not know where to start with how bad this movie is the premise of weavers forming an elite group of assassins is about as realistic as bakers forming an elite parachuting group because the writing was in the danish pastries it tries badly to emulate the matrix and fight club and ends up insulting both lets start with the main character a dull insipid little man with seemingly no control over his own life whose dad was an elite weaverassasain and left him when he was born probably because he was embarrassed by the sheer mediocrity of his offspring then there is angelina joile as fox poorly written and acted with no apparent explanation of her actions she just wanders around looking cool until she shoots herself in the head thank goodness morgan freeman used to be one of my favourite actors until he starred in this film special effects and big bangs do not make a movie and i hope that everyone in this film never makes another one truly awful i would rather rip my eyes out than watch this again,fantasy
first of all i want to say that i enjoyed this movie it is very different from the usual action flick and very very imaginative even if some scenes go a bit far in imaginationrussian director timur bekmambetov does quite a good job in the action scenes and you can notice some of his own style previously seen on nochnoy dozor night watch he gets to work on a smart and inventive side of the movie and that was the good point of the moviewe have actors with some good names here morgan freeman angelina jolie and james mcavoy i appriceated this last ones performance as he achieves to deliver a serious character and run some few gags during the movie specially in the beginning where the scenes have some humor morgan freeman and angelina jolie were kind of reduced to a secondary role i think but it is always nice to count with these academy award winners and i also to comment on the fact that angelina jolie brings up some class style and of course beauty to this movieat last but not least the plot i thought it could be well improved in some parts of the movie because i noticed some holes in the story but i also enjoyed some elements in the movie that were quite interesting specially the part when the screenplay gets the final twistfinishing up is a fast vertiginous actionpacked and inventive movie that really reminded me of shoot em up because of its crazy action so before watching this movie just turn off your brain and watch this movie with a different vision of it thats what i did and it worked  710,fantasy
much hype russian director superb star cast action movie big scale great stunts  that is what i saw in the trailers added to that a few friends who saw the movie  recommended it as a very good movie so here i go to see the moviewesley james mcavoy is an accountant  bullied worried and bankrupt in a supermarket shootout action  wesley knows through fox angelina jolie and sloan morgan freeman that he is the son of an assassin soon he gets involved in being rigorously trained by this assassination cult his missions are to kill bad people in one mission his target becomes his own father and that is the time  wesley realizes the real story behind everything happening to him i wont give spoilers here  but wesley in the end does take his fathers place by eliminating all the bad guysthis movie is a collassal waste of money with senseless action sense and a story that only nave person can write one has to keep our brains out while watching the moviethe russian director timur bekmambetov  hollywood outing does not fetch him any great points and he has to wait for another good story and movie to showcase his talent surely his talent is shown in megascale actions and mystical suspense  but that does not bite the audience tastejames mcavoy a good actor  does everything that his director asks him to do  but the movie is not a matrix to fire anything for him angelina jolie and morgan freeman  are those stars who would fetch the director some good audiences but nothing sustains in the endthe actions are high speed and out of the world  whatever one can imagine one can find here believe in the instinct and one can curve the path of bullet while shooting  that is the type of stuff they showfor very hard core actions friends  who just want fun this is their outingstars 425 out of 10,fantasy
is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours its like an adrenaline shot right to the heart full of exciting action spectacular adventure suspense and mystery with many twists and an unexpected ending its a entertaining and enjoyable movie which maintains a very good rhythm throughout the entire movie it ends exactly how it begins the story is very interesting and the plot about a frustrated office worker learns that he is the son of a professional assassin and that he shares his fathers superhuman killing abilities is very convincing has a great cast james mcavoy as wesley allan gibson his performance is very good first as a guy frustrated with his life and then as a cold blooded assassin angelina jolie in the role of fox his acting is powerful and convincing morgan freeman as sloan the leader of the fraternity is excellent as always he has no limits as an actor in one movie he can be the kindest person and in the other he is the baddest to conclude a movie worthy for its action scenes very enjoyable and highly recommended,fantasy
when i first saw the trailer of this movie i think it will be a stereotype kind of movie with many technologies and heavy computer elements like the matrix trilogy and also the actors with great names are only a few in this movie like morgan freeman and angelina jolie the director timur bekmambetov also isnt really famous for his work but i thought i maybe give it a shot to see it it turns quite good james mcavoy acted this movie very well he could changes his irish accent into american accentand he poured his entire emotions into this movie so his quality as an actor is really shown in this movie the plot of this movie quite interesting its about a fraternity who raised many assassins i dont really want to talk about the ending of this movie because i want all of you to watch it its highly recommended,fantasy

i was expecting the american debut of director timur bekmambetov the man who made the night watch series a fascinating and catching vampires meets bulgakov film in the decadent postcommunist russia the result is quite disappointing but no usual stuff eitheryou can watch and enjoy it if you forget for the duration of the film both laws of physics and rules of morality the story is of a secret society of assassins working according to a code of rules and instructions received from no other than fate itself killing is presented and i would not say say justified but no question is asked about who writes the rules and what is the collateral damage of the actions of the society in a film where more than half of the screen time is spent in motorized killing rampage the annihilation of the laws of physics is of course another accepted feature of the comics genre the effects are well done remind to some extent matrix without the astonishing visuals of the brothers wachowski while the innovations curved trajectory bullet a recovery bath that looks like some kind of a cement mold etc seemed to me to be somehow naivewhat about the movie itself the dark cinematography was consistent but the unidentified american metropolis looks less intriguing than the moscow the director left behind morgan freeman and angelina jolie do what they are expected james mcavoy makes here another landedinaforeignworld type of role same as he did in the last king of scotland and ends by being the most incredible serial killer we are in danger to see again if this film is only the start of a series,fantasy

has been out for some weeks now and is winding down in the box office but if u havent seen it yet u really should this has to be the most badass movie since crank came out back in 2006 which u should also see it opens up with about eight people getting their heads blown off sparing no blood of course if ur squeamish to blood and violence this is not a pg13 action flick for sure this shows the violence and in graphic detail but enough about the violence this movie truly has a good story and good acting but the thing that stood out most to me was how well made this film was with the over the top action sequences to the countless times we get the bullets eye view and to the well done twist in the story towards the end in short this is a great summer action flick that should not be missedps to all the guys out there u even get a quick peek at angelina jolies nude ass,fantasy
its been called earthrottling nonsense and the cinematic equivalent of an energy drink but in my opinion is entertainment personified from the beginning the viewer is thrust into a fastpaced adrenaline pumping world full of intrigue originality and fun many people demean this film owing to the impossible action sequences and improbable circumstances however i dont think these people realize the origin of the movie is a rip off of a brilliant comic by the same name which surrounds an assassin cult of infinite ability called the fraternity owing to their supernatural ability to focus to an astounding extent yes what they do is impossible just as with superman spiderman or any other superhero ever producedtruly i found a fresh innovative heartpumper of endless proportions linking new camera techniques with an invigorating storyline that leaves the viewer gasping for more,fantasy
ive never really liked theatre runs of loud expensive action movies but im willing to make an exception for this one perhaps because its so loud and fast and flashy and actually ends up leaving an impression on me rather than just staying on the screen and fading out like so many others james macavoy gives his best shot at playing a total loser that in a lengthy fish out of water sequence is beaten up stabbed and such and such however for some reason that can only be explained with otherwise redundant camera trickery he has some kind of matrixlike superpower which allows him to do a lot of implausible stuff i just accepted in the end you cant fire a bullet through an entire labyrinth just because you believe in itor maybe you cani wouldnt know but if you really plan on enjoying this movie hell get used to things like this even though the conclusion with the circle is even too much for me seriouslywhat the hell either wayit keeps you occupied for a couple of hours,fantasy
speaking as someone who did not have any idea that the movie was based off of a comic book and chose to see this movie because the action scenes in the trailer looked pretty ridiculous i mean that in a good way i was definitely not in the least bit disappointed the story has a sort of fight club meets matrix meets sin city feel lots of gratuitous blood sailingthroughtheair beatings whooaaslowdowninthemiddleofahighspeed actionscene shots and the idea of trading in your cubicle for a life of violence but it definitely works mcavoy is likable his nerdy accountant turned assassin character gives lots of opportunities for witty lines and funny scenes jolie once again manages to look amazing while shooting people through the head the action sequences were pretty wild total special effect eye candyis a very fun sometimes absurd action film plain and simple dont try to take it too seriouslybut then again if exploding peanut butter filled rats crazy bullet trajectories and defying gravity with cars isnt your thing theres always walle right,fantasy

then is exactly what you are looking for it requires a minor suspension of belief curving bullets around objects to hit targets on the other side but if you enjoyed titles like fight club which is far more intellectually stimulating but nonetheless an action flick shoot em up crank and smokin aces which common was in too then there is no foreseeable reason why you should not enjoy this delightful actionfest that can slap a smirk on your face in even the most violent moments i imagine it is an incredibly difficult task to construct a scene where everyone in the audience can gleefully smile as they witness people getting their brains blown out whats more i got the vibe that the audience did not feel sadistic while witnessing such scenes instead many therein chuckling under their breath if not laughingwarning potential spoilers in the next paragraph our protagonist wesley gibson is a character not unlike the narrator that edward norton masterfully acted as in fight club stuck at a deadend job leading an unhappy existence needing a changeofpace etc he is approached by an ancient and secret society of assassins called the fraternity which made an exception for angelina jolies character fox after seeing that he has the blood of a naturallyborn assassin flowing in his veins skills with guns that would put annie oakley to shame and finally losing his temper at the office wesley is brutally trained to become a master killer he is trained very well indeed as i hope you will witness should you see with that i implore you to see the film in its intended medium in the theaterutilizes incredible special effects a cast of very talented actors and a storyline that keeps the audience interested just enough without detracting from a constant pace of spectacular action will not win any oscars but it accomplished what it set out to do entertain and be fun you might need to be in the right mood or even with the right crowd to enjoy this the way it was intended to be i however went alone and still had a wonderful timelastly it is based somewhat on sixissues of graphic novels by mark millar i am sure i will be looking in the bookstore for these in the near future perhaps reading those before seeing the movie will make you appreciate it even more than those who have not enjoy,fantasy
upon first watching this movie i loved it it was filled with action thrills twists and just the right amount of badassness in short it was exilerating however the night after i watched it i sat back and thought about how silly and unrealistic it was a loom telling a secret society of assassins who to kill i mean come on now thats pretty ridiculous and making bullets curve through air not possible so if you want to see something with intense plot and character studies this movie is not for you i am usually not a huge fan of mindless action movies but i still loved this movie not angelina james and morgans best performances but they still did a decent job i would recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to sit back and have a great time 910,fantasy
action movies at its finest back in the day these movies use to be a dime a dozen but now you are lucky if there is one competent action film every five years i personally am tired of mutants people from other planets and monsters being the heroes for once though this movie is based on a comic series it is not like spiderman or the hulk this movie has the feel of the matrix meets equilibrium are the action sequences over the top yes but look at the great action films and tell me theres not over the top moments in those not to mention i absolutely love the fact the of the r rating i have grown tired of the pc movies that come out if pg13 movies are so wonderful then why are there only 5 of the last 15 best picture awards winners pg 13 not to mention those movies are very pushed to the limits of pg 13 summertime use to be about popcorn and action films and its nice to see one that is absolutely balls to the wall,fantasy
in short was really good for a comic book movie it was good anyway some cheesy parts but the lead played by mcavoy was great you can tell a lot of effort was put into development of his character his acting was easily the best jolie has acting skills for sure but it wasnt seen in this film freeman as always does well but seems he dialed it in with this one i have read the graphic novel and the ending is fine because it was similar to the book the middle isnt like the book at all but dont let that put you off it was still good it is just so weird how only 20 was from the book but thats hollywood for you right the comedy was good an the script was decent an its 2hrs so you get your moneys worth the action is the drawing point but honestly it was bittersweet yes it was bloody an fun but it came with some problems here and there i say this now the opening action scene took me out of the movie an will confuse some people for the rest of the film also there were points were it was unrealistic yes its a comic book movie an yes its over the top at times but seriously there are scenes where it just doesnt fit at all pacing was ok but should have taken a bit of more focus the last twenty minutes were good an the big final shootout is really fun and a spin on what you have already seen overall its fun and even with some gripes here and there there is a lot to be enjoyed,fantasy
this movie rocked  its definitely not the same as say  iron man but it has a lot of moments it is way over the top  and very matrix like in some ways  with much begged borrowed and stolen  however it all works  and works welli dont think you have to have a crappy life to relate to the main character either many movies are about improving your life it is more about being in control of your life vs the other way around you do not have to be a comic booksuper herosuper villain assassin to relatei think many people are looking for realism in action movies whats the point in that the story is nice  its tight the dialog is fine  for what it is and the plot elements are nice too there are shades of star wars rocky  and um even fight club which i think makes it great there is some depth but they waste little time which makes the action good there is the loom they make very good fabrics there is the wax bath the heals you in a day or two  after rough night on the town or in training there is the 400 bpm heart rate that allows some humans these gifted assassins to react or act super fast  as if time slowed downfor those that did not like this flick  relax and you might have good time uptight and constipated is no way to go through life just a final thought  an all caps summary for a post for this movie is the proper thing to do  it is not shouting  or if it is  its proper shouting wtf happened to imdb,fantasy
this is the movie in which i knew so little when i was seated in the cinema except for the fact that angelina jolie is in it and it is action packedthen came the first 10 minutes no rolling credits with james mcavoy as miserable as he can be i started wondering if this was the right movie with angelina jolie this is a very clever movie because the life of james mcavoy begged sympathy and provided an excellent balance with the actions the action sequences was excellently choreographed and sent the hearts pulsing the images as seen by the assassin his leap across the building the supermarket encounter the car chasing scene were just the beginning of a series of breathtaking actionsangelina jolie is so charming even more than in her role as mrs smith against bradd pitt her eyes are all smiling when she trains james mcavoy and her tutoring sessions on the top of the train fully demonstrated her fluid actionsi never peeped at the watch and there were twists and laughs from time to time all the actorsactresses are excellent the only minor disappointment is morgan freeman  he is excellent as always but he doesnt look a villain and he has played such paternal roles for so long it would be nice to see a new face for a changejames mcavoy did exactly that he looked so suppressed in the beginning then his special talent surfaced and the running and fighting all added up he also knows how to act such a delight that in the second part he caught my attention even more than angelina jolie but the truth is i cannot imagine anyone playing the role any one better than angelina joliewill there be a sequel,fantasy
this gonzo visionarypop russian director day watch night watch makes his hollywood debut with a splashy actioner unoriginal and even more unbelievable in its farfetched graphicnovelbased story of a meek man turned superhero but striking for the craft of its details and featuring a central character who gives things a fastbeating heart and draws you in by seeming as scared by his exploits as youd beto fit an american movie mold bekmambetov throws aside the fantasmagoric russian vision of his scifi vampire spectaculars and focuses on chases and battles but from scene to scene he maintains an exceptional level of craft apart from car and train chase scenes that outdo most others this is a veritable treatise on superhero ballistics youve seen the slowmo magnified bullet thing before but he makes them a little more psychedelic and surreal his ace shooters so precise their bullets meet in midair and we see them collide and split even if theyre curved to go around obstacles the bekmam is evidently still excited by what hes doing and he rises to the bigger challenges like gangbustersthis movie damns all logic a car jumps up over another car and upside down the driver picks off his victim in a gorgeous climactic sequence a long train crashes down a mountain ravine caught at the top undulating like a giant slinky while adversaries do battle within and without moments like this are satisfying to look at for their color and texture as much as for the cool preposterous way things dovetail and whip around the movie never falters in maintaining its energy and distinctive lookthe film stars morgan freeman and angelina jolie as familiar if elegant arch villains but theres a new guy on the block james mcavoy as wesley gibson the timid terrified unwilling dbutant killertrainee they recruit whose to him unknown father was one of them and who therefore is found to possess genetic peculiarities that make him capable of paranormal feats of mayhem and carnage his panic attacks for which he pops tranquilizer pills daily while trudging back and forth to a demeaning office job as an accountant are a sign that his heart can go up to 400 beats a minute and his adrenalin can pump so hard he can see and shoot off flies wings yeah well you had to be thereis full of stretchers but they are what make possible all the splendid visual tricks theyd quickly pall though were it not for mcavoys humanness as the meek trampledover wesley whose overweight obnoxious female boss janice lorna scott makes life at the office miserable while his best friend chris pratt is screwing his snippy girlfriend kristen hager mcavoy who has played the scot that he is notably in the last king of scotland a virtuoso role despite being overshadowed by forest whitaker and a wide variety of brits including the victim in atonement and a disabled punker from dublin not too surprisingly reincarnates himself completely not just with an american accent but a whole american young guys voice maybe a little like the young tom cruises but sweeter and less needy its an act of ventriloquism and rebirth as cool and astounding as any of bekmambetovs gimmicks and as essential to the movies success hard to praise mcavoy too much or to think of any other actor today who could have brought such vividness to his initially meek character and still take up the physical demands of such a role with comparable energy and verve this guy is talented it was obvious he could handle all sorts of emotions and personalities and now he turns himself into a hyperkenetic hunk so two gifted foreigners smash into hollywood blockbusters with a bang here the russian director and the scottish star and this movie is a lot of fun even though the rather creaky comic book mythology of the secret order of weaverassassins who need to recruit a new guy to take out a rogue member just gets hokier as it goes along the loom of fate that spells out the next victim in a code of warp and weft you have to take it all on faith but thats easier when things are flying through the air weve had conveniencestorepharmacy shootouts so often before theyre getting to be a standard scene but the one early on here that makes wesleys intro to fox angelina and the ultraviolence of the fraternity the assassins society is so violent it recalls the overthetop joke grossout one in gregg arakis underrated the doom generationmorgan freeman as the fraternitys bossman sloan is typically authoritative but his hectoring sententious lectures to wesley quickly grow tiresome jolies fox however has an offhand panache her role has been criticized as underwritten but she does plenty with the willtimed monosyllable the cunningly displayed tattoo the anorexic arm extending an outsize silver pistol and the pouting lips her performance says if youve got it you can just flash it you dont have to flaunt it as an essential foil to wesleys panics and ebullience she is dashing and cool and between them theres a kind of lowburner romance both are too busy to indulge in to see fox draped upside down on the front of a speeding ferrari with guns blazing in both hands is to realize what a long way female like black actors have come as american fantasy heroesleaving reality in the lurchbut while theres a ton of stuff you can learn from comic books most of that gets lost in the noise of screen adaptations even though the hokey walter mitty platitudes about living life to the full are compensated by some truly wonderful physical feats and ocular trickeries this is not like every other 75 million action movie and iron man and the incredible hulk cost twice as much by the way,fantasy
this movie is pretty much a mix of fight club xmen the matrix and kill bill like fight club there are sequences which use cgi that portray the frustrated mind of the protagonist and the story is narrated by the protagonist using very unique details like xmen this movie is about a brotherhood of super humans the curving of the bullet is pretty much a reflection of the matrix and like kill bill this movie is about hit men this movie had it all it was really funny it was deep it was gory and it basically defied the laws of physics only thing is that i wish angelina was less skinnier it seems like tomb raider is long gone this movie had the best ending i had ever seen when wesley looks directly at us and says what the fck have you done lately the best rrated movie of this year,fantasy
i really enjoy a good assassin or hitman flick really i doafter a recent string of poor to very bad trained gunmen and assassintype films hitman shoot em up smokin aces etc i had high expectations for given the toprate cast and after seeing the stylistic trailerunfortunately has way too many flaws to warrant plunking down your 1012 to see it in the theater at best this is a rental or if you are patient wait for it to make it onto hbo or showtimewhile it has an interesting premise begins with strong setup and features some great action sequences the negatives outweigh the positives the acting is fairly weak the development of the protagonist mcavoy is rushed and unrealistic even with my disbelief suspended the overall pacing is way off and the plot becomes more and more unbelievable as the movie unfolds by the time you get to the final act youll be shaking your head as it is just that badoverall given the talented cast involved i was unimpressed,fantasy
another example of a good movie ruined by the unnecessary harming of innocent creatures yepi know its fake thats not the point showing the pretend abusive killing of innocent creatures makes it easier for the real abuse of those same creatures you cannot continually show bad behavior whatever the type whether its on tv movies or the news and not expect people to become desensitized to it once that happens anything can become ok scoff all you wantjust because its a rat doesnt mean its ok in other words when you turn on the news and hear about some crazy who killed kids in his basement do a little homework and ill bet you find this same individual had a history of hurting other life before upgradingphillip,fantasy
i was completely expecting only an action movie with ms jolie kicking ass and just went to the movies for watching a summer flick and having a good time and for my luck i got more yes the plot is predictable at some points but the twists in it for me werent predictable at all and actually found them really interestinggreat fx lots of not unnecessary action sequences and lots of new entertainment not a copy of anything even when everybody says that they copy the matrix slow motion effects ok who doesnt all action movies use them now and actually i think they took what the matriz brought to another level the story is witjames mcavoys character and performance is great actually all the things that he thinks the way he acts i found it actually really deep always asking to himself lots of things and the way he portraits this is amazingangelina jolie beautiful and perfect since she appears on screen till the explosive finalescript is perfect and filmed in an exquisite way camera movements are a delishi know it is based on a comic never read it definitely now completely interested but i supposed that this movie respect it a lot even some shots are totally as if you were watching a giant comic book on screen hope fans were satisfied because i have had a good hell of a ride and actually got me thinking in lots of things try to look deeper and you will find more than action and you will appreciate it lots morehope bekmambetov gives more of his visionary and amazing world soonlove it,fantasy
i was amazed after i saw i was expecting to be a really good movie but not this great i was really blown away by what this film brought to the big screen sure it does have a matrix style to it but the humor and twists made it even more interesting and enjoyablejames mcavoy is wesley gibson a 25yearold man whose life is miserable as hell when he is working his boss always complains regarding his work and his girlfriend cheats on him with his best friend gibson is basically nobody until he meets fox angelina jolie a member of the fraternity a secret society that trains gibson to develop pretty amazing and find the guy that killed his father after joining the team gibson turns his life around and soon learns that the organization he is in is not actually what it looks likei thought the story was great and really well told i was very surprised by the twist in the story the movie wasnt really long but it still manages to tell the whole story fine and clearly i thought the director did a great job at thatthe acting in the movie was great james mcavoy was the perfect choice to play wesley gibson he understood the character and did a great job i thought angelina jolie did a good job as fox some people thought she was bad but i though she delivered a pretty good performance angelina was tough and physical which i love about her as for always morgan freeman did a great as sloan and he made me laugh in some parts of the moviebesides the storyline the action humor and special effects were amazing the action scenes were incredibly entertainment and mind blowing curving a bullet is pretty cool the special effects were amazing i thought the effects were very realistic the humor is the last thing i love about i was seriously not expecting the movie to be so hilariousis one of the best summer movie and it delivers in every way this is one hell of a ride and i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
let me start by saying that in my opinion has raised the bar that every action movie of 2008 must strive to meeti was very impressed with james mcavoys transaction from serious dramatic roles such as the last king of scotland and atonment to excellent action star to me his disgruntled employee role was very similar to that played by ed norton in fight club i think we be seeing him in a lot more of these rolesthe entire cast played there parts well with morgan freeman giving a role similar to that of his merciless mob boss in lucky number sleventhe acton scenes were over the top but instead of taking away from the movie this actually made it better by reminding audiences that it was nothing more than an adrenalin fuelled thrill ride with intense action scene some twists and a good sense of humourbut with all the action aside i think the best part of this film and the one that will stay with me the longest is mcavoys final monologue and a last line to rival that of the recent iron man filmsif you are not a fan of action films then this wont be your cup of tee but if you want to take your mind of the real world for 2 hours then is definitely the movie for you,fantasy
first of all it is important to note that is fundamentally not an adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name the filmmakers may claim that they have tried to remain true to the spirit of the source material which supposedly inspired them but if so then they have signally failed in that endeavour to be fair i never believed that hollywood would ever produce a faithful version of what is one of the most entertainingly twisted and blackly amusing comic books ever published if any contemporary film industry could only the japanese or perhaps the south koreans might have given a good account of themselves in producing a cinematic translation of just look at the sort of stuff takashi miike puts out for example as it is the film we have got has a radically different plot  there are no superheroes fair enough there were none in the comic  but only because earths supervillains had teamed up and brutally killed them all in this movie the fraternity is not an organisation of supervillains glorying in the gratification of their worst impulses with the tacit acceptance of the worlds governments and law enforcement agencies  no instead theyre a brotherand sisterhood of assassins dedicated to the enforcement of justice as decreed by fate itself sorry but thats a much weaker concept than the original illuminatiesquire cabal of evil bds who act out the maxim do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law so infamously proselytised by aleister crowleywesley gibson as played by the ubiquitous james mcavoy is when we first encounter him the same selfeffacing disgustingly humble wage slave that will be familiar to readers of the graphic novel albeit not in appearance  as drawn by the original artist wesley clearly resembled eminem and of the other principal characters the fox was the spitting image of halle berry and wesleys dad the killer bore more than a passing resemblance to tommy lee jones so with this flick we dont get the ideal casting as envisaged by the comics creators well such is life and mr mcavoy is a decent and engaging actor who acquits himself very well here next up is angelina jolie playing the appropriatelynamed fox whose introductory scene is sadly not as memorable as that in the comic wherein her character slaughters the entire staff and clientle of a franchise sandwich shop simply in order to intimidate wesley and because she can in the movie she first shows up to protect wesley from the murderous attentions of the man who killed his father oh well at least angelina is as easy on the eyes as ever and approaches the material with aplomb lastly we have morgan freeman as the head of the new york chapter of the fraternity and mentor to young wesley mr freeman could play this role in his sleep  thankfully he doesnt and instead puts as much energy and conviction as he can muster into his performance my only cavil with his portrayal here is that theres something fundamentally unlikely about morgan freeman saying motherfker that had me snickering with disbelief he certainly doesnt sound comfortable saying the wordsome of the gloriously foulmouthed banter from the comic book survives much to my relief the character of mr rictus is sadly absent from the film so we dont get his hilarious rejoinder i dont fk goats mister gibson i make love to them and wesleys closing speech though one of the more enjoyable pieces of dialogue in the movie is nowhere near as cool as that in the graphic novelanother problem with this flick is that it suffers from the modern malaise  its too pc not an accusation that could have been levelled at the source material fans of the comic will note amongst other changes that wesleys overweight harridan of a boss has suddenly become white rather than black  presumably so that he can figuratively speaking bite her head off without the chattering classes claiming that the film is racist similarly the cholo characters that harass wesley daily and later receive their deserved comeuppance are noticeable by their absencethe fly scene however is present and correct showing as it does that wesley has inherited his old mans skills as an assassin so too are the decoy scene in an amended form and the shooting range with human cadavers as targets the guy who beats up wesley in order to teach him to overcome his fear of being hit doesnt meet the same fate as in the graphic novel and thats a shame as it was much more satisfying than what happens to him in this film the newlybadassed wesley also doesnt shoot his socalled best friend in the face and drop his body in a dumpster when he decides he wants payback for the latters having been rooting wess girlfriend behind his back for months on end somehow smacking the fellow with an ergonomic keyboard seems like rather a wimpy alternative the cinematic does however feature the best use ive seen of exploding rats since botched the scenes featuring the loom which dictates the directives of impersonal fate are visually impressive as are those where wesley singlehandedly storms the factory building after his rodents have softened the place upwhoever selected timur bekmambetov as director for had obviously been paying close attention to his work on night watch and its sequel day watch and he brings the same visual flair to this flick as he did to those coupled with striking cinematography courtesy of mitchell amundsen to sum up is a decent action film with an amusingly ludicrous plot memorable special effects gorgeous visuals and good photography its worth seeing on the silver screen just for the spectacle  but dont read the comic first or youll be constantly aware of what youre missing,fantasy
a young man stuck in a mundane job suddenly got pulled out of it by a beautiful dominatrix and into a world where it seemed like hes the one savior to rid the bad guys from the face of it when the trailer first came out there was word that hey its the matrix all over again this time with one of hollywoods latest it boy james mcavoy it rhymes too in the starring role of an indestructible superhero with a penchant for the gun theatrics save to say though the storyline for is anything like the 1999 wachowskis movie for the sole fact that its many miles away from the various philosophical musings that ploughed deep into the matrix worldbased upon a comic book series by mark millar and jg jones is russian director timur bekmambetovs first foray into the english language hollywood bigbudgeted blockbuster and if youre looking for a nobrainer summer popcorn movie then would be right up your alley its noisy and in your face its spruced by special effects it has immense violence and its littered with so much profanity i thought bekmambetov might have felt it was standard english for those familiar with his russian science fiction works in nightwatch and daywatch bekmambetov brings about the same distinct style of his in delivery high octane action and balletic gunplay that would probably rival john woo in the business set against pulsating rock music and plenty of bullet against bullet in shots so cool it deserved to be repeated again and again milking the one trick in various screen situationsfrom the onset you know youre in for a ride that requires a suspension of belief sits right up there with any superhero movie because the characters all perform superhuman stunts from leaping out of buildings unscathed to possessing prowess that can be trained in weeks to the creation of a lazarus pit equivalent to heal all bodily wounds if any assassin can plough their trade as demonstrated in the story i guess all of us have got to be afraid from their 100 accuracy from 10000 miles to  wait for it  curving a bullet around the bend via a flick of the wrist ok so all these might appeal to even the most jaded action genre fans as its honestly something that is refreshing especially since it combined effortlessly with the visionary visuals of bekmambetovbut gets plagued by lazy storytelling even by standards for nobrainer action movies the first few intertitles compressed the timeline from 1000 years to just 6 weeks ago and undoubtedly the ending too reeks of carelessness and the same super summary all these to tell a story of the transformation of mcavoys wesley gibson from the narrator to a tyler durden equivalent complete with the account of daily drudge with easter egg visuals filling up the screen as he channels his energies into the right direction of assassination after being accepted by the fraternity undergoing a training regime equivalent in toughness as experienced by kung fu panda picking up skills from gunsmith common the repairman marc warren the butcher dato bakhtadze and the exterminator konstatin khabensky  there you go the equivalent of crane mantis monkey and viper  hes chief tutor is the ultraskinny fox played by angelina jolienow we all know jolies body comes tattooed and in her movies they usually get the full makeup treatment to mask them im not sure if those are authentic tattoos on jolie but i guess they do provide you a hint at how they adorn her body while not quite your trinity type she thrives on a whole lot of adrenaline that would make a drug junkie blush and gets assigned the duty to train the rookie in the ways of the frat whose motto kill one save a thousand she believes in wholeheartedly i cant remember watching jolie on screen and quite anorexic looking as well though her new found ubersvelte figure gets featured in some of the best action sequences in the movieas mentioned youve got to leave your logic prowess at the door and leap into fantasy mode so that the action here would be plausible and sometimes ridiculous to boot especially when some unfortunate attempts at humor found its way into the mix and i cant help but to laugh out loud when a crucial plot development sounded like a ripoffbroken record of another famous trilogy that will go unnamed here which in actual fact can be seen coming from a mile awaybut there is a saving grace to its limited intelligence though its a timely reminder again of how absolute power over life and death corrupts absolutely and whats there to stop corruption at the top when they have the means and the firepower to exact changes and given anything that is prone to human interpretation youd come to expect some form of corruption as folks at the top skew things in their favour either for selfpreservation or climbing maslows hierarchy of needs it explored this very quickly mainly because it had to make way for more action but i thought it was a somewhat good effort to have it included no matter how small oh and many things in the movie also went unexplained as well so dont try to spend too much time figuring out how to harness the power of an extreme adrenaline rushfor those who like their screen violence graphic unadulterated and unflinching in slow motion reverse motion and pulling out all tricks in the special effects book then is for you otherwise itll just be another routine exercise that is all style and little substance something which most reviews tend to harp on and ill throw my 2 cents worth of contribution at as well,fantasy
rather than adopting the titanic struggle between good and evil from its source comic book focus on one single character  an everyday loser who turns out to have more than meets the eyes this approach has the advantage of eliciting right away empathy from the segment of audience that root for the underdogthe first 20 minutes the prologue aside look more like a sitcom than an action thriller wesley gibson who may as well have loser stamped on his forehead continues his miserable daily existence the highlights of which consists of being harassed by a typical tyrannical boss and cheated by his sneering girlfriend with his best buddy needless to say when his googles his name nothing comes up the rest of the movie offers little surprise  discovery that he is the son of a topnotch assassin in a mysterious organization called fraternity grueling punishing training to make him the best various assassination assignments confrontation with the traitor and a twist that you should see coming if you had paid attention in the prologue the action sequences accenting on pistols firing with a backhand like in tennis and bending bullets think beckham are good but in the end what seems to give even more satisfaction is the vindication of the underdogjames mcavoy on whose performance the entire movie anchors demonstrates the excellent casting job by coming through as an empathywinning underdog morgan freeman ever unfailingly makes his presence felt as the head of fraternity angelina jolie sexuality expected matterofcourse adds to her role fox the lethal assassin a dimension you havent seen before  a taciturn deadly brutality personally i am most happy to see good old terence stamp in a small role but one that has an important part to play,fantasy
i read quite a while back having heard about it and seeing that im a comic book fan and collector i bought it and looked forward to a good read wow it was the worst piece of junk ever laid to paper thank god they didnt faithfully adapt the book the first half of the story was excellent i loved wesley gibsons character and then it started to quickly slid downhill with the introduction of ridiculous characters made of crap literally theres another idiotic character whose name i cant repeat here a booger picking moron and costumed super hero battles in alternate universes it was like the first half of the book was written by one person and then the second half was written by another person who hadnt read the first part and just jumped in with whatever plot they felt like writing basically the graphic novel was about an assassin brotherhood but these assassins in the comic rape pillage and wantonly kill anyone they want period yawnthankfully they changed the second half of the movie from the comic nixed the super hero battles moronic crap filled characters booger picking antiheros and costumes and went for something more realistic if you called curved bullet and bullets smashing into one another realistic but i can live with that its like a ultraviolent urban fantasy and its absolutely fantastic i adored this movie and i cant wait to see it again some people criticized the second act as the fraternity as the assassins call themselves brings wesley up to speed but i enjoyed every minute yes even the torture porn as one reviewer called it was cool third act awesome never lets up they even semikept the twist from the comic but made it better and yes wesley gets the last word even if its not quite like the original story its still funnyto help gauge this review i am not between the ages of 1625 and i am female i would not take my two young kids 10 and 13 to see this movie its a great adult fantasy,fantasy
while dc and marvel comics have the most share in the spotlight for comicbooktohollywood adaptations it is not uncommon for the lesser known literary material to meet success with endearing cinematic endeavors to the big screen that is where this gun blazing action thriller comes to play based on the graphic novel by mark millar this action thriller directed by russian filmmaker timur bekmambetov mixes hyper bullet time action with sin citystyle violence to create a stylized matrix like bullettime from the striking visual flair to the frenetic gunblazing action this film treats moviegoers to a bombastic hardr adventure that while doesnt engage with a powerful plot nor to fuel the brain with its mythical law of physics with its action provides just enough pulsepounding thrills to keep action junkies glued to their seats from the opening scene to the end it is clear that the director draws his influence from the the matrix and he manages to put his semidistinct vision into a good use the results are something fresh for the actionthirsty filmgoers to chow down on this film stars james mcavoy as wesley a frustrated and disillusioned chicago whitecollar worker tormented by his boss and living with his unfaithful girlfriend played by kristen hager who is secretly cheating on him with his best friend barry played by chris pratt when he is caught up in an outrageous shootout with a hotshot assassin fox played by angelina julie he learns he is the son of a professional assassin fox introduces him to a secret society known as the fraternity lead by the charismatic sloan played by morgan freeman with the help wesley must master their powerful abilities to prepare against the fraternitys most powerful enemythe film pedals with a plot that is compelling enough but perhaps nothing special or surprising on an eyebrowraising level but that is not the main appeal here as the films major attraction to the park is the hyperkinetic action director timur bekmambetov brings mark millars graphic novel to life with some of the most electrifying action sequences ever put to screen but certainly not in the way will engage the brain cells that is because the main attraction in this visually stimulating action is the characters abilities to curve gun bullets upon firing combining elements of bullettime action that owes homages to the the matrix and stunning cgi bekmambetov brings a hefty hand to setting the action in a powerfully fresh showcase but does so that like in the source material rebels against the laws of physics with bullets flying in a slow motion curving paths and at far more than enough times colliding together in midair this film superbly lands a fair amount of visual compulsion and heartstopping action to fuel the adrenaline while pushing the boundaries of physical absurdity there is also a few car chase sequences added to the mix while the action is nothing short of fun and excitement it should not serve as a science lesson to how gun bullets as it is physically impossible to manually curve a gun bullet and exceptionally rare for opposing bullet to meet in a midair collision nonetheless it is clear that bekmambetov has a clue of what he is doing the plot moves a fairly decent pace and the character stand just enough depth of them to make them compelling to watch james mcavoy delivers a fine performance in the role of wesley a zerotohero man who discovers hidden ability he never knew he engraved although he brings nothing particularly powerful to the table the actor firmly fits the bill easily the most appealing role is angelina julies character fox who julie blesses plentiful amount of grit and eyeappeal to she firmly establishes herself as a strong compelling badass chick morgan freeman the charismatic actor he is storms the screen with a sound performance as the fraternity leader sloane nothing more nothing lessis a compelling ride thrill ride and certainly fits the slot as mustwatch for most if not all action fans everywhere although this film never blows any entries of the genre out of the water including in terms of graphicnovel adaptations it nonetheless makes for an appealing pick for everyone hungry for some hyper kinetic action,fantasy
stated to be based on a graphic novel in another review and it shows secret societies and superhuman powers come right out of the sfmodern fantasy milieu and so as at least one other review points out does i am your father the frantic action of the chase at the beginning and the final shootout produced many moments where i just had to laugh at the absurdity of all the impossible things being shown i cant imagine that the likes of morgan freeman and angelina jolie needed the money so i suppose they just did it for fun i felt they did their best with what the script offered and james macavoy acted his character well  but what a comedown from the last king of scotland dont expect it to have much connection with reality and you may enjoy it,fantasy
saw the movie only recently  but i found it great for those that did not like it i can only say they fall into one of two categories1 people that do not like action movies and so they should have not watched in the first place 2 prudes that like only movies that have pseudo philosophical themes and hindu mythology mambo jumboeven if it goes over to top with credibility at some points most of the abilities of the characters are not impossible they are improbable but not impossible the movie is action packed from start to endthe only part that is really incredible is the part with the liquid that heals everything liked very much the rats with bombs idea and also the roof top idea of course using a bomb instead of jumping with the car would have been easier and more realistic but that does not change the main pointthe main point of the movie in my humble opinion is the idea that where there is a will there is a way so no matter how much protection or money you have you can still be killed,fantasy
is loosely based on the comic book miniseries of the same name by mark millar its directed by timur bekmambetov and stars james mcavoy angelina jolie morgan freeman thomas kretschmann common terence stamp and konstantin khabensky the storyline follows wesley gibson mcavoy a frustrated and downtrodden office worker who discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin when he is saved by fox jolie from being assassinated himself in a supermarket initially he is baffled and out of his depth but upon meeting the secret fraternity headed by sloan freeman gibson starts to undergo training to fulfil his destiny as a fraternity hitmanone of the better things about popcorn action movies is when there is a geek coming good and kicking ass be it superheroes or average joes finding something extra having the rise of the meek get tough at its core is normally a winner so it is with the us directorial debut of nightday watch helmer timur bekmambetov its not so much that mcavoys anxiety riddled office worker gets to play guns sports cars and hang with a lithe angelina jolie its that he courtesy of a good source gets to not care about the killing the film may not be as dark as the source material but the essence of it is there with corruption and violence at its core the story as bonkers as it is is simplified into one that features ancient weavers receiving messages depicting targets to be wiped from the planet for the greater good of humanity enter the fraternity in modern times which in the name of good goes out slotting said targets oh but its not just a case of line someone up in a telescope and pull the trigger this is more fun than thatfor action movies in this decade has few peers from the intense and brutal training regime that gibson undertakes to the number of explosive and inventive sequences that flit in and out of the piece it delivers pulse raising cinema theres outrageous car pursuits car jumps with whirls and crash bangs speeding trains resplendent with stunts a train crash sequence thats as good as anything in popcorn world and then theres the bullets curving bullets that either smack into each other or do untold damage to the forehead of some unknowing target that the makers are not aiming for the pg13 market is an obvious bonus for it allows them to fully payoff on the fights and blood letting even those that come with funny and inventive gimmicks bekmambetov is having fun the nature of the beast is a haven for his fastcutting and slowmo dalliances while the noise that thunders out of the speakers pulls one further into the actionmcavoy steps up to the action plate with great success at times charming yet pathetic at others totally scary he revels in the chance to carry a movie of such adrenalin fuelled excess jolie too comes out with much credit the role of fox giving her the chance to shine unlike lara croft as a charismatic action girl while freeman does what freeman does well be straight and oddly classy not since john woos action berserker faceoff 11 years previously has the action genre been this much fun and exciting the pace may not be perfect and some scenes will be just too ridiculous for some demanding critics they of course realise the tongue in cheeknudge in the ribs thats going on but regardless has taken the action genre to another level lets hope its not 11 years till we have to wait for the next bar raiser 910,fantasy
i was let down by this russian directors vampire saga of night watch 2005 and day watch 2007 so i had little interest in this overthetop actioner the generic title did not helpthat is until i realized it was adapted from a comicstrip by the same man behind the ultraviolent superhero flick kickass 2010 which i lovedif anything the film is fastpaced unrelenting in gravitydefying action a la the matrix indeed so extreme is the approach that this could well be dubbed when bullets collide and engaging enough in plot to be tolerable still james mcavoy does not exactly convince as action hero  nor is morgan freeman credible as the brains behind a group of rigorouslytrained assassins whose severe beatings are eventually cured by undertaking a wax bath on the other hand while i could not care less about the gossipmongering style of angelina jolies private life her casting is ideal  though the role itself seems to be merely an extension of her mr and mrs smith 2005 characterization  and slinky presence obviously easy on the eyes the fact that an old flame of mine is not just the exact same age as ms jolie but is practically her spitting image never fails to arouse yours truly besides it is nice to see terence stamp in anything these daysthe mayhem then is interpolated with quirky humor particularly involving mcavoys messy domestic situation and his relationship with an insufferable and obese female boss and for what it is worth the plot undergoes a 360degree twist at the finale resulting in a jawdropping mass executionsuicide via one solitary bullet,fantasy
if you want action has it but action alone is not enough is also frustrating the plot is awkward and totally unbelievable the action scenes defy every law of physics making it tricky to suspend disbelief sometimes they even provoke unintentional laughter the characterization is rubbish and the script is full of silly lines worst of all the ending leaves you feeling cheated when all is said and done is just a typical over adrenaline rush where the only real talent is in the visual and sound effects department who are virtually unnoticed by the masses paying to watch this while angelina jolie gets all the attention in a razzie worthy performance skip this moviethe story dumb all the way through but for the first two thirds provides just enough of something to keep you from walking out yes it is slick and things do start to build towards what promises to be something epic that is where the film kicks the viewer in the teeth the climactic act takes some lame twists and has a disappointing ending there are several questions you might have when the film is over but you may not care enough to want to ask them depending on how annoyed you are with the movie if a sequel gets made i may forgive for the ending but that would hardly cover it as it stands right now im afraid i cannot give it a pass,fantasy
the moral of this movie is as follows you should become a quasineitzchean superman who doesnt take lip from anyone the way to do this is to go into your dads business and do whatever the magic rug tells you tothis movie could have tried to be a mindless action film about amoral bastards which it is but it has denial issues it tries to make bold philosophical statements undermined by its own ridiculousness it just doesnt use enough explanations to cover the sheer amount of impossible stuff going on and cant be taken seriously at the same time it moans pleas and begs for the viewer to be awed by its nonexistent depth the protagonists are unlikable bastards the action is bogged down by slowmotion shots of bullets computer keys teeth etc that are cute in the first five minutes and then get irritating the film tries to pass off cheap wish fulfillment as courage and realizing true destinyno matter how collateral damage you wantonly inflict and how many people you kill you cant be an action hero if you take orders from a loom,fantasy
thankfully i didnt pay to see this at the cinema but rented it insteadthis is the perfect example of vacuous popcorn films with no concern for anything bar how it looks you can forget about any semblance of a coherent plot likable characters or nuanced film making  it is purely visual sensation with limited originalityif you like mindless gratuitous violence that rips off the matrix and wastes the acting talent present youll love this and going by the general rating for this tripe plenty of people do btw i have no problem with violent films directors like tarantino and peckinpah have made some great ones but a film being violent isnt necessarily any goodif you prefer films that dont take the audience for granted look elsewhere,fantasy
okay firstly what in the name of all that is holy is hollywood legend morgan freeman doing in such an awful movie maybe he has outstanding debts to the irs that he desperately needed cash and was willing to star in anything he would have walked away with more dignity starring in an amatuerly made bad porn movie and for angelina jolie well lets face it she wouldnt be famous if it wasnt for her legendary hollywood star father jon voight who im sure wouldnt think twice about starring in this tripe secondly the movie itself storylineridiculous and full of clichs hardly any thought put into it whatsoever if you want to watch cool movies about assassins watch hitman 510 the killers john woo collateral cruise desperado banderos leon luc bisson dont limit yourself to second rate movies like this theyre are a waste of timethirdly all this bullet time cinematography has been done before notably the matrix which by the way this movie rips off to the max i mean urving bullets around corners come on and even when this movie tries to be clever ie the scene with the keyboard well excuse me for noticing that there is only one letter u on any make of keyboardi sincerely hope this is not the best there will be in hollywood action movies however at the same time it excites me slightly because as an aspiring scriptwriter im sure to make some bucks if this is my competitionbut even i know that in hollywood it is sadly sometimes a case of not what you know but whothat matters and that is my only conclusion as to how this movie was madeandrew,fantasy
it actually took me two tries to sit through this movie i was excited to see it since i had read the comic book while ill admit the comic book wasnt great this movie was awful the first 20 minutes of it was like the comic book but i think who ever wrote the movie stopped reading the comic book at this point i really dont know what the writer was trying to do the movie has nothing to do with the comic book he changed the supervillains into superheroes and simply left out the superheroes while ill admit the comic book wasnt great this movie was awful whoever wrote it should have at least read the back cover before writing the screenplay and to those of you complaining about the violence the comic book was a million times more violent its a terrible movie dont watch it the comic book it a little bit better its funny and has a plot,fantasy
is one of the best looking bad films of recent years it has tremendous style and the set design and action sequences are very fun its really too bad the filmmakers forgot to wrap something around them movies generally need a plot has one of the stupidest premises in recent years so stupid i felt insulted watching it it reads as if it was written by prepubescent ten year old boys i honestly wonder if the intelligent morgan freeman read the damn thing or had his agent give him the jist of itstarts off as an all most office space rip off james mcavoy is a highly unlikeable whiny accountant named wesley gibson who doesnt seem to have a grasp on his life he complains and yet he lets the world bite him in the ass every day his problems are supposed to be all solved when he meets fox who brings him to sloan and tells him he has the blood of an assassin wesley agrees to train to be an assassin and his training consists of selftorture where i actually was rooting for the trainers after a rockyesqe montage wesley is a killing machine given the mission of a life time from sloan who surprise surprise isnt all that he seemsive heard people defend this picture saying it is escapist action fun well i pose this what are we trying to escape from compentency in making a motion picture if you want escapist action fun rent the matrix which is essentially a rip off of pretends to be deep and clever and have mythology behind it sloan tells wesley that they kill out of fate alone and their targets are chosen by binary code stitched into a sacred shroud surprisingly all the targets live in the chicagoland area where the film takes place the concept of fate choosing the targets is somewhat interesting but how it is executed is stupid if this shroud is so sacred and the fraternity wouldnt they have killed every target what is even more stupid is that fox places blind faith in it to the point where she commits suicide at the end of the filmi guess the thing that frustrates me the most about is its talented leads shouting out dribble i would think the very talented angelina jolie would be smarter than to take a picture to be eye candy and eye candy alone fox doesnt do or say anything she is a prop not a character the films salvage point is where the morgan freeman character is revealed to be a villain i like morgan freeman and think he is one of the finest actors we have today i want to see him challenged because he is essentially the morality figure in every film he is in i thought good we will finally get to see freeman be evil well he doesnt get to do anything as a villain at all mcavoys character gets the most screen time brutally killing the entire fraternity with suicide bomber rats freeman doesnt give any reasoning into why he is a villain or why his name may have been chosen by the shroud he is there to look villainous and to die nothing more morgan freeman deserved better as did the audience,fantasy
if you want to watch this movie in 2k19 you will may not like it but it is definitely one of the best movies i have ever watched,fantasy
one of the most surprising films of the comic book genre ive been aware of this film for a while but only recently got around to watching it and i can gladly say im happy to have seen it boasting an all star cast who are all excellent in their roles the twist reveal of mcavoys parenthood is a little predictable but on the whole theres not much at fault with this the side swapping of characters does wear a little thin after a while but generally the performances do negate that issue action is hyper stylised and looks fantastic plus the laws of the world are also believable adding to the experience similar sort of commentary to what fight club is revered for its a tad bit more far fetched but still has some meaning and value to it on the whole if youre wanting a different comic book film experience then this is one that well worth the time,fantasy
as i understand it is based on a comic book or a book or some kind i am not familiar with the printed workive only just watched the moviethe film starts off super strong and compelling but as it goes on it increasingly proceeds in fits and starts albeit often violent ones the special effects are very good and for me at least the story was pretty much completely off the wall which is why im being charitable and giving it an extra star or two there is no way im going to claim that i knew where this story was going or that i saw any of it coming which i really liked and allows me to mostly forgive the herkyjerkiness of the plotin the end though i felt that was mostly a triumph of style over substance and i doubt ill remember it very well pretty soon it goes without saying that it ends with an action movie blowout fight although it was satisfyingly untypical as i mentioned earlier because its at the unique end of the plot spectrum its sneaking by with an extra star or two ive simply seen so many movies of which a large number are nothing more rehashes of plots that have been done to death that i almost automatically bump up the rating of any film that seems to offer something new or unexpected id call a flawed gem and i have no regrets about watching it however its a long long way from being any kind of a masterpiece,fantasy
i started this movie because of the main actor angelina jolie morgan freeman and chris pratt but out of the first 20 minutes all i got was f this and f that seriously cant they figure out something else to fill in the blanks than the worse english word possible the beginning of the movie was awful and hard to bare but i was interested in seeing the plot unfold so i kept watching once action started the cussing slowed down which helped but it was still unrealistic what did i like about the movie some of the action was nice some parts were funny and i liked the plot twist it was the rest though that really needs some work to make this a better movie and the end why did it have to make me feel bad about myself it was such a horrible ending that hurts peoples feelings and makes us question why did we just watch that to get that ending,fantasy
loved it so much amazing actionso impressed by the cinematography,fantasy
man this movie rocks ive seen this film so many times these past six or seven years it never gets tiresome i think i have seen it maybe twenty to thirty times by now and i love it just as much as i did when i first saw it in 2012 its visual effects are really good and theyre not overdone the acting is fantastic and i believe this is one of james mcavoys best roles to date hes very convincing in the film and portrays lead role of wesley gibson a struggling anxious office worker whose boss humiliates him bigtime as his coworker and friend has sex with his girlfriend behind his back  to which wesley is aware of yet shows no desire of stopping it or doing something about it he just lets people walk all over him that is until he meets fox  played by the talented angelina jolie and a team of assassins known as the fraternity the fraternity is lead by the wise hypnotising morgan freeman whose acting is also fantastic here and in general there are huge plot twists and unbeknownst to wesley the true antagonist all along was sloan morgan freeman as we find that the man who believe to be the villain and antagonist all along cross who we believe has killed wesleys father at the start of the movie is actually wesleys father and all along he was trying to protect him their reason for training wesley into becoming a masterful assassin and pitting him against cross he was the one person cross would not kill superb cinematography and choreography intelligent techniques the bulletbending technique is both shocking and absurd all the same yet very unique and cool solid performances direction and a lot of profanity violenceaction and sadness all throughout there are heartfelt moments mindbending jaw dropping action sequences unpredictability and a lot of strong dialogue as well timur bekmambetov outdid himself here as a director i feel its a wellbalanced yet prominentlydark action thriller with thrills twists chaos and madness to keep you at the edge of your seat wanting more a sequel is in no way farfetched and to this day id love to see one 910,fantasy
i am an avid movie buff of sorts but my tastes are a little out of the ordinary i dont find myself watching 99 of movies i see more than the one time on the short list of favorites of mine this has to be about 4th on the list the movie had all of the elements i look for in a well put together script i find something new every time i watch it for me that is a big thing the action the suspense the story and the climax all met my high standards maybe im just one of those people who has secret assassin inside of me too just one panic attack away from setting my life on the path of acceptance for now ill keep taking my pills but ill keep a loose grip on that bottle just in case,fantasy
the beginning scene with wesley seems oddly similar to the matrix even the recruitment scene the first half of the movie was basically the matrix but set in the real world jame mcavoy was really trying too hard to be an american here he sounded obnoxious and annoying at the beginning but then bearable in the middle to the end cause of the action sequences all in all the movie was a meh for me something you would waste your time on but not something you would write home about,fantasy
if the script is written by a twelve year old i get it so cheesy and cringy almost every scene is like that still i was entertained,fantasy
fab entertaining  great music for people who level the unrealistic criticism and matrix comparison  sigh  was the matrix really realistic isnt it realistic to wakeup and become an assassin the next day after a few weeks of heavy duty trainingwax healing it seems illogical to expect this film to be realistic and if you dont think about the plausibility of shooting backwards  upside down bending bullets etc  i would recommend this film but yeah  the effects were fun and it was a great example of an entertaining escapist film one i might even go see again this is a fast paced movie with decent story and decent performances well suited to the genre it represents,fantasy
sometimes i wonder what people are thinking when they review movies here this one did fabulous at the box office its a good scififantasy action movie the fact it had james mcavoy morgan freeman and angelina jolie says a lot it is not supposed to be taken seriously but as a comic book fantasy i thought the weaving was very clever it deals with fate and in norse mythology you have the weavers the norns who control fate they are connected to what is called wyrd i assume one of them knows something about this and loosely brought that idea into the storywyrd is a feminine noun and its norse cognate urr besides meaning fate is the name of one of the norns between themselves the norns weave fate or rlg from r out from beyond and lg law and may be interpreted literally as beyond law according to voluspa 20 the three norns set up the laws decided on the lives of the children of time they are often called the weavers anyway i related to that when i saw the weaving going on and how it was connected to fate one would have to know this mythology i suspect to get that in my mind they adapted that into a modern actionfantasy story it doesnt have to follow any laws of physics or anything else because it is not meant to be factual but just a good story which it was this movie is being so underrated yet the matrix always gets applauded and it is just another action fantasy story they are not alike except they both have great special effectsif you like action and the unbelievable in a story that comes directly from a comic book then this is a good one im not going to tell much more because it will spoil it for those who havent seen the movie just enjoy it and dont try to make it connect to the real world you have to listen closely and watch because there is subtle information imparted during the movie that makes the plot clearer most critics reviewed it pretty well it is non critics that are making very bad reviews which should be disregarded if you dont like the action type of movies dont watch this one because something is happening through the whole of the movie mcavoy is outstanding in the movie,fantasy
just as the stunts in this movie defy logic so does the plot and the characters based off of the comic mark millar and jg jones the movie makes little sense in and of itself but none theless is enjoyable the movie starts off briefly explaining the fraternity and shows the death of one of its members and then quickly shows us the lead character wesley played by james macavoy explaining to us why his life sucks his girlfriend is a b his best friend is a jerk and his boss janice constantly induces his anxiety attacks while purchasing his anxiety medication he is confronted by a woman named fox angelina jolie who claims that someone is trying to kill him and then in the middle of the store engages in a gun fight and takes wesly on an insane car chase his is brought to the fraternity head quarters and told that his father was a member and that wesleys destiny is also to be in the fraternity as well this movie has excessive amounts of profanity and although it does not cite this in the newspapers some nudity you see most of angelina jolies back side as well as a mans butt it is funny that if it is a guy it isnt considered nudity hmmm well the violence is also excessive but it is not on caliber with a horror film in that it shows some gore but not explicit details it primarily has a lot of blood splatter shots and no real detail like brains or diembowlments the acting is as good as you can expect it to be in this type of movie since the twists the plot takes make no sense nor do the choices of the characters make any sense it is the wish fulfillment qualities of this movie such as cussing out your b boss and smacking your ahole friend with a keyboard that makes it remotely satisfying the action is first rate and as long as you are not bothered by excessive profanity and violence then this will be an enjoyable movie for you just do not think too much or the whole movie will unravel this isnt the type of movie that has to make sense it is merely here for eye candy both in visual effects and angelina jolie,fantasy
slick but overstylised action flick from the russian director behind the night watch movies plotwise borrows heavily from both leon and the matrix in the story of a young slightly nerdy man working in a dead end office job who finds himself being indoctrinated into a world of assassins and massive cgiheavy action sequences what follows is extremely fast paced never for a moment realistic and full of the kinds of unbelievable ott scenarios that will give even the most hyperactive child a headache weve got cars rolling through the air trains dropping through the sky and in the films neatest concept bullets that can actually bend around obstaclesis given some decent credibility thanks to the actors who populate the parts james mcavoy is fine for the most part apart from a single car chase in which he screams and whines like a girl for the entire duration morgan freeman sleepwalks through his role and angelina jolie is given little to do other than pout and snarl on occasion but other minor parts are given to effective performers like thomas kretschmann and terence stamp the action comes thick and fast and with it a great deal of heavy violence and on a superficial level the film admittedly works but the biggest drawback is bekmambetov whose excessive style makes the likes of crank and gamer look like sedate merchant ivory productions,fantasy
when i sat down to watch this i wasnt expecting anything great i was hoping for plenty of action and tension though on the first count i wasnt too disappointed as there was plenty of action although most of it was highly stylised and full of cgi unfortunately it wasnt all that tense though as i didnt find myself caring about the characters james mcavoy plays wesley an accountant who is put upon both at work and at home until on day he is told that his father who he never knew was in fact part of a group of elite assassins unfortunately he learns that a rogue member of the group who is picking them off one by one killed his father he is then recruiting into this fraternity of assassins and is trained until he is ready to kill the man who killed his father although nothing is quite what it seemsjames mcavoy was good enough as wesley although he was more convincing as the pathetic accountant than he was as an assassin angelina jolie was okay as fox the person who first introduced wesley to the assassins and trained him and morgan freeman was as good as one would expect him to me as the groups leader the training scenes seemed to drag on a bit longer than was necessary and once he was told he could go after his fathers killer he got to him rather quickly there was a twist at the end that wasnt entirely a surprise although it was well handled overall this is okay if you want some mindless action but it certainly isnt anything more than okay,fantasy
i have to say i thought about this movie for quite some time after i saw it a week agothe story as i goes is a very good story or at least on paper lets start with the good the special effects and chase sequences are eye candy jolie was a good choice for the role her knack and expertise in playing a seductress and assassin was well done james mcavoy is an up and coming star i felt he played his role as a depressed socialite in a tedious environment wellthe only thing that lacked was the story development the first scenes dont relate or fit well or even explain what it means to the rest of the story without giving anything away the script tries to make a twist 23rds way through the movie  and it is fairly obvious the movie ended much like it started  vague and questionable if you like to judge a movie by its replay value  it doesnt have anyanother writer mentioned morgan freemans role and how he looked like he didnt want to be there  i couldnt agree more his character is underused and it appears he wasnt given a whole lot to work with in regards to character developmenti think if some of the fight scenes would have been a tad more realistic instead of matrixlike this would have made an average movie into a good movie take the movie for what its worth  if you like action movies can over see the obvious plot holes and want to be entertained you will enjoy maybe not love but enjoyworth watching if you tivod and want something to do otherwise i wouldnt recommend running to hollywood video and renting 410,fantasy
this movie starts off a bit strangely and if we had known upfront that it was based on a graphic novel it would have made sense sooner the main theme is a fraternity of assassins so there is quite a bit of graphic killing but it is done in a comic book style and i believe most viewers will accept it as suchjames mcavoy is wesley gibson in a boring office cubicle job and with an extra large woman for a supervisor he is about to go crazy there when one day at the supermarket he gets caught up in an assassination attempt in the process he meets angelina jolie as fox they escape in a wild carchase scene and she tells him that he is destined to follow his father into the 1000yearold fraternity of assassinsthe targets of the assassinations are obtained in a very unique way woven into fabric in a binary code morgan freeman is sloan who operates the weaving mill and who shows wesley how things workin addition to fox there are character names like cross gunsmith the repairman mr x the exterminator and the butcherthe plot is fairly convoluted but suffice to say that certain characters have superhuman powers like the ability to slow down time so they can for example dodge bullets or shoot such that their bullet smashes against a bullet headed for them at times the photography reminds one of the matrix this isnt really my type of movie but i was fairly entertained,fantasy
this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen or better started to see i went out of the cinema after watching 50 minutes of this crap dont compare it with matrix because matrix was intelligent new breathtaking is an awful orgy of blood violence and stupid unbelievable action scenes pardon computer animated action scenes but wow slow motion scenes of bullets hitting a persons head and coming out in an explosion of blood thats real cinema or is that the new kind of cinema a young man someone everybody else is pissing on discovers superhuman power super human power wow thats new is his name bruce wayne or harry potter no its wesley gibson forget the name forget the movie is not worth spending 10 cents on it,fantasy
i wouldnt normally review a film without seeing it but the trailers were so bad i couldnt bare to go and watch it bendy bullets give us a break  but the thing that really sickened me was the bus stop advertising campaign in liverpool uk  and no doubt other cities  we really dont need glamorous depictions of powerful handguns being waved around by glamorous hollywood stars we have enough real handguns being waved around by teenagers and fired at people ending livesthe rich people from beverley hills that made this stupid film wont have to live with the consequences of their hyper realistic cgi violence sadly the real people in cities like mine will,fantasy

is a fairly entertaining action flick that tries to make up for its lack of heart with excessive cosmetic surgery from the very beginning its evident that the makers of the film basically took fight club the matrix and various elements of about every successful american action movie ever threw them in a blender and tried to make a jagged gripping concoction it just ends up being borderline silly contrived and very apparently the piecemeal frankenstein of action prototypes that it is its nowhere near the bar that its predecessors setfrom the beginning the script plays down to you in a yeah im joe everyguy the downtrodden antihero you could be me sorta way most action movies do this subtly and aptly coaxing the audience into empathy but with selfpitying lines spouted out of the narrator like i dont care about anything the only thing i do care about is the fact that i dont care about anything you cant help but shoot the screen a cockeyed look and shake your headatrocious script aside the well done action sequences do the viewer good sure theyre farfetched but look its a movie surely if any of our favorite action flicks have taught us anything its that we should check reality at the door and just let the 90 minutes we pay 10 bucks for provide a singleserving escape from the repetitive drudge that everyday life and its accompanying laws of physics enforce so ill let the gratuitous action slide some scenes however do get a little stupid ahem the rooftop scenethe acting was on the whole okay a little cut and dry half the cast was underutilized ive got a weakness for jolie so ill let the fact that she spoke maybe 6 lines throughout the movie slide the romance between the lead and jolie feels underdeveloped and undeserved youll say to yourself youre telling me she fell for that dude character development was weak because it was all focused on the lead and hes either screaming or whimpering throughout the movie the plot twists are way guessable but still welcomewhat really boggles my mind about this movie is how styrofoam the theme is throughout the film i couldnt ignore the thoughts i had about its superficial message the implications this movie exposes about our modern culture and how cheaply the makers try to exploit it the movie asserts that people will be miserable dribbling broken creatures with no sense of ego until some kind of cathartic surreal cast of characters comes and swoops them away into the fairytale life that they were engineered for they just didnt know it until a series of remarkable events entirely based around them unfolded in addition the point at which the lead really rolls up his sleeves and gets to work is when he fully realizes that his old man was the top assassin in the crew what youre telling me that the kid was waiting for a precedent to be set by his father before he could do the work necessary to become successful human being that doesnt sound like much of a hero anti or otherwise to methis theme just plays to peoples common expectation of entitlement yeah ill just lead a meaningless and trite life until an attractive broad in a viper abducts me at gunpoint to reveal my true purpose my advice dont hold your breaththe film ends with the lead breaking the fourth wall and asking the audience what the  have you done lately no no no what the  have you done lately wesley so morgan freeman and his cast of cronies show up and beat some superpower into you and then you make the tough decision of turning against them to avenge your dad bfd a quarter of the audience would have no problem doing that except with 75 less sap and better one linersthe most frustrating thing about this movie is that it couldve been excellent with a couple of well thought out modifications,fantasy
aside from a flashy amusing car chase scene at the beginning this movie has little going for it gotta really suspend disbelief a lot on this one totally unbelievable lots of violence gun play graphic bloody killings etc kind of like many games they sell to adolescents the story is weak the acting is unimpressive and is full of empty action it is like a graphic novel or comic book if iron man can be so much better this could have been a decent movie a shame movies like this are being made that glamorize violence to young boys save your money and rent a good movie you can really enjoy without having your intelligence insulted obtw angelina has never looked worse and luckily has few lines of dialog nothing to get excited over at all,fantasy
ah i can sense the pathetic effort in making this a hit like bourne series or transporter the guy looks kiddo though that was the point and to compensate they try to take off his shirt for the delight of female crowd but do we 90 of our life live like that so we need more than stone model to make life run in a movie ofcourse lara croft added her charm and i cannot find anything miss in her part though she was with the dark side at the end which broke my heart i felt i wasted my time though i was watching with high hopes i think the crowd who wood like to watch these kind of movies are those who need a dog to help them sleep because they are too scared to sleep alone and to cover up their weakness they want to see them as pseudo hero typical freudian confusion,fantasy
this movie will redefine your understanding of the action movie and im not just talking about the bulletbending thing dont get me wrong i loved the idea of nonlinear projectilesbe warned though it is somewhat gruesome at times that having been said i truly appreciated that they showed how truly ugly real elite combat training would have to be ive always hated when someone goes from an ordinary guy to the best in the world over the course of a montage and without suffering at allthe music the cinematography and the acting were all off the chart but the direction outshined it all the director managed to tease out a whole new side of angelina jolie told a compelling story and led the audience on an incredible journey of surprises and not lame m night shyamalan surprises but real surprises like the prestige which you should see if you haventi highly recommend this movie,fantasy
first of all the story seems to be pointless an assassin that goes around killing people because of some rule or code it seemed that the story was boring and should have had more to it it seemed plain and was something that was not focused on by anybody who was making the film i find that they thought the rest of the elements of the movie would make up for it which they did notnonstop action i predicted and that was true every seen had some action in it all of it had very well done special effects and great ideas but if there is no story its ruined and wastedthe humor in the film was honestly stupid just awful it was dark humor and pointless again seemed quite childishin terms of acting in my opinion angelina jolie will always be bad to me she is meant for the action parts why not be a stunt double only in mr and mrssmith was she good freeman was okay quite good actually but deserved not to be in this movie honestly he does not belong in it swearing etcthis movie is a catastrophe,fantasy
my pop who saw it first and highly recommended it to me was blown away by this film and so was i now im gonna get the bluray version not to mention the dynamic musical score by danny elfman this movie pulls you in from the first scene to the very last wellpaced transformation of the protagonist from dweeb to superassassin a movie about breaking out of ones mundane everyday mold and taking revenge on those who deserve it a charles bronson death wish for the new millennium combined with a version of the league of extraordinary gentlemen that actually works this time thought provoking throughout i will never again think about the profession of the ordinary weaver in the same way,fantasy
well a friend said it wouldnt be that bad he was wrongive seen a lot of action films that are dark or even downright depressing but few that have been so utterly joyless as even given the special effects including the ridiculous curving bullet effect theres so little sense of play i just felt nauseous from the action rather than exhilarated this is like riding a rollercoaster while hungover and with a flu i never identified with the lead adolescent couldnt understand why they an adolescent lead to begin with and i happen to think angelina jolie is sexy  but not here the director seems at pains to make her look skinny and sickly and cold and clammy  brrr i get a chill think about itdefinitely a film by misanthropes for teenagers pass,fantasy
ive spent some time out of my life reading the ridiculous postings of a very few idiots someone that would watch a movie and expect believability in everything you see must not watch many movies the very first thing you learn in any course on literature writing movie making story telling etc is you must suspend the audiences belief behaviorsthis being said this movie is a very good example of just that they dont pretend for this to be from the real world or based on a true story etc they immediately let you know without a shadow of a doubt that your belief in reality will be questioned  the man jumping from the window firing and hitting with each shot hahahahah if you like to be entertained thrilled to be on the edge of your seat with anticipation then this is a very good watch for youi give it a 7 out of 10salute,fantasy
was intense humor and great story all rolled into one hell of a action movie it begins with a bang and ends with a intense climax that will have you on the edge of your seat wanting more i was surprised that i liked this movie but i did and i will be watching it again of course if you looked into this movie a bit youll know that it is unrealistica bit like the matrix if you cant stand bullets curving and cars jumping in the air youll be the one is annoying your friends and family because your whining about how unrealistic it is but what do you expect its a movie it doesnt have to be realistici highly recommend if you like extreme action and a lot of head shots and blood and guts its a great action movie all the way through until james mcavoy delivers the last line 910,fantasy
when his father dies wesley allan gibson james mcavoy comes to find out that his father was a member of an elite group of assassins called the fraternity he is recruited by sloan morgan freeman and trained by fox angelina jolie the repairman marc warren the butcher dito bakhtadze and gunsmith common to assassinate his fathers killer cross who was once a member of the fraternity but he betrayed them throughout the movie wesleys personality and attitude change and so do his abilitiesdirected by timur bekmambetov is slow at the beginning and you have to kind of follow the plot very closely but it is a good movie in the end there are a lot of unexpected twists and the casting was great there is great chemistry between all of the cast members on camera the scene where wesley and fox are racing for the flags that are on top of the train was very good stunt work i would highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes action movies with a tint of comedy,fantasy
not only do the elemental natural laws benefit us physically they also benefit us dramatically when a character jumps from a skyscraper for instance we know that he must fall if the rules suddenly dont apply we cant be surprised and delighted by the bending of them because there are no rules to be bent in ways both literal and figurative the laws of nature keep our feet on the ground sometimes as in the matrix the rules are cleverly rewritten in contemporary action films theyre more often just ignored im as willing to suspend my disbelief as the next moviegoer but a few too many jumps from one skyscraper to another and i can bring myself to do little more than shrug if these assassins can perform such feats of magic why are they limited to knives and bullets i can hear its defenders its only eyecandy if only when the main character looks at the camera and tells me im a worthless human being i take exception and so should you this is no tyler durden inside an everyman its a vapid action movie lecturing me about the purpose of my life rarely has a movie so explicitly held its audience in contemptid be angrier if i thought had a clear cogent thought in its head since it is dedicated only to the aesthetic of cool it doesnt the final measure leaves the viewer unable to account for what he has seen except to remark that it was sporting of the filmmakers to attempt to show him things he hasnt seen before like exploding rodents and the use of a human head as a gun silencerbut it isnt quite accurate to say that has a um wanton disregard for life because it disregards lots of things including simple logic and the laws of physics dispenses with anything that stands in the way of turbocharged cinematic action i suppose thats entertainment to some to me its identical to every other testosteronedriven mediocrity that coats the screens this is what is truly pathetic and ordinary,fantasy
2008 jolie mcavoy and freeman make awesome assassins mcavoy plays wesley gibson a cubicle dweller who gets clowned on by everyone from his boss who treats him like crap his girlfriend who is nailing his best friend and takes pills for anxiety attacks in short a complete wuss the worse part is that he doesnt even have the sense to fight back until angie jolie shows up and informs him that his dad just got killed and that wesleys dad was one of the most hardcore assassins on earth wesley then finds himself caught in the crossfire of a gunfight kind of like in most anime serieswesley wants to know more about his dad so he joins the fraternity the assassin group that his old man was part of morgan freeman is at its head so you know its going to be good what happens next defies description what i just said is not really giving away the plot since you can see this in the trailerstimur bekmambetov a director i never heard of came out of seemingly nowhere and weaved magic he took bullet time and made it unique again bullets fly around objects with reckless abandon people perform seemingly supernatural feats and everyone looks so cool while doing it jolie played the typical hardcore chick with a sensitive side to the tee and mcavoy plays both a wuss and a killer with equal parts efficiency and gusto one of the few worthwhile rappers common is in there as wellcomic book spoilers is based off of a comic book series but changed dramatically i think that some of the changes made in the transition from comic book to film were for the better in the comic book wesley was more of a sick and demented antihero committing disturbing acts with very little accountability acts disturbing to a person who still has a soul and the fraternity was just as wicked as the people they killed you kind of wonder about the creator of the comic book and what points he was trying to get across in the movie the fraternity plays more of a heroic vigilante role and wesley becomes a warrior seeking justice for himself and the world these changes are for the better in my opinion if they had filmed as the comic book was you would have protests in the streets and an automatic nc17 rating there are plot twists that you might see coming and then again you might not end comic book spoilers in short what the heck youre waiting for an invitation go see,fantasy
two words the imitatrixgosh what a shame that imdb doesnt allow a user to dismiss with a pithy twoword comment a quite mundane and by now quite hackneyed display of special effects enlivened solely by the magnificent if wasted presence of miss jolie instead it requires that i go on blabbing about a movie that really doesnt deserve the effort it takes to type this out solely because the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text well in order for this not to be classified as padding the comment with junk words and being blocked from future submissions i guess id better mention that the film managed to leave out the only remotely interesting aspect of the comicbook miniseries upon which it was based the fact that the gang of assassins into which out hero is dragged is a satiric comment on the supervillains faced by superman and batman in the dc universe substituting them with sometimes obscene or scatological versions clayface for example becomes sthead you get the idea fanboy fun sure to please the fanboysthe ones who probably hated the movie id imaginethere have i said enough now sigh,fantasy
theres a difference between an entertaining if mindless action movie and just plain onscreen silliness this movie is the latter it started out promising enough ordinaryboring guy in meaningless job gets a chance to change his life around by becoming a worldclass assassin of course ah the american dream but from about the halfhour mark onward the movie just descends into plain silliness yes i understand they were trying to go for a matrixesquire feel and these assassins have special abilities but nonetheless it just felt silly to me and not in an even remotely fun waythe movie lost all credibility for me when they introduced the loom of fate are you kidding me mistakes in the weaving tell you in binary code haha who to kill i didnt think an individual movie could have a jump the shark moment but there it wasthis movie is a rental at best dont waste your money going to the theater,fantasy
i am actually feeling generous for giving two stars for this movie thanks to the illogical technically stunning sequences anyone with a bit of sense would laugh out during some the so called serious moments in the movie especially the one in the climax i dont want to spoil the movie by telling that and that is nothing worth mentioning eitherpros stunning graphics angelina looks a bit old but still is hot and sexy cons  where is the logic  few though the action scenes are good to watch they make you laugh wanna cut some time watch it at your own risk,fantasy
i saw 6 days ago thought it was good i kinda went broke paying for my ticket because i had 10 and 950 went to my movie ticket anyway lets just go on to what i thought of itthe good i liked the special effects were awesome really mind blowin  spoiler the twist where you find out that david ohara isnt james mcavoys daddy caught me off guard the action was pretty bad ass i liked the supporting characters more then i liked the main character its not that i hated him i dont know just wasnt my cup of tea the montague cuase who dosnt love a movie montague the ending was coolthe bad although im fine with cursing in films i dunno but for some reason the f word being said every 20 sec just got to me  something about the movie just didnt pop for me example i would tell my friends to rent it but not buy it one thing i didnt understand was when his boss was yelling at him he had a panic attack but when angelina andcrossi dont know the actors name were duking it out nothing happened but i dont know i dont have panic attacksoverall it was a good movie but not the greatest movie ever,fantasy
i really to like this movie and in some ways it succeeded the action is intense the special effects shots can be brilliant esp following the bulletsbut this movie suffers because the dialogue is terrible at times laughably so when a fantastic actor like morgan freeman delivers lines that are supposed to be the pinnacle of the intensity for the film and just come across as a hackneyed clich then the movie just loses its weight it could be the screenwriter it could be the director but there are some fantastic actors in this that act so hokey it felt like a parody every time the lead character did a voiceover monologue it was weak and campyso in summary visually stunning rent the movie and watch it with the sound off,fantasy
dont kid yourself nobody went to this film to see any of the actors listed before angelina and the studios knew it are there posters of trailers that feature james mcavoy who is he anyway i saw one site that said they are thinking trilogy that he is the next bourne give me a break mcavoy compared to matt damon unbelievablewhat was the best feature of this movie hands down it is angelina jolies lips director timur bekmambetov made sure that there were plenty of closeups of these luscious parts men melted in the aisles as they came to the screen next it was her warm green eyes they just grab you and wont let go unfortunately for mcavoy they can also trap you into doing things that are wrongangelinas trigger finger is not to be overlooked she proves that she is a capable match for any bad guy and willis or thurman have nothing on hermcavoy got a real closeup of jolies uterus when she was splayed on the hood but only shiloh joliepittand whoever else is in thereknows what its really like lookie james but no toucheeeveryone is focuses on jolies breast when their eyes stray from the lips not on full display in this film but check out taking lives original sin and of course gia for more informationit is jolies heart that captivates many and she showed a little when she came to mcavoys aid in shutting up his girlfriend the world knows that heart welldespite the 20 minute set up in this movie we really cant focus on mcavoy there is likely to be a sequel please no trilogy and it will likely feature jolie again we can only hope,fantasy
wesley gibson played by james mcavoy has been beat down by life at the ripe old age of 26 he hates his job he hates his boss and when he catches his girlfriend cheating on him with his best friend he doesnt even have the nerve to stand up for himself so imagine his surprise when it turns out that his long lost father is a superpowered member of a secret guild for assassins and wesley has inherited his powers wesley is so adept with weapons that not only can he literally shoot the wings off of flies he can do it on his first attemptits at this point that wesley meets up with fox played by angelina jolie she introduces him to a world where the rules no longer apply to him hes above the law as long as hes a member of this assassins guild called the fraternity is based on a controversial comic of the same name written by mark millar it will be hard to believe for those that see the movie without having read the comic book but the film is actually toned down the fraternity has their own code of ethics they are doing what they feel is right and are unconcerned with and unapologetic for any collateral damagethey train wesley in the ways of their world special baths that accelerate healing the power to slow down their perception of time thereby increasing their own reaction time and the ability to bend the trajectory of bullets and lets be honest it looks pretty damn cool tooling around chicago in dodge viper killing bad guys and using angelina jolie to make your exgirlfriend jealous makes for a fun friday night in my bookthe fraternity teaches wesley an odd mixture of slavish devotion to the group fate and sense of elitism masquerading as individuality think of it as fight club meets the matrix by way of ayn rand eventually the fraternitys true nature is exposed and wesley is forced to choose between those three things he chooses individuality and takes on the fraternity singlehandedly in a final showdown i apologize if you consider that a spoiler but thats pretty much the standard story arc of movies like this so i dont feel its to terribly revealing at its core is an adolescent revenge fantasy but its a slickly made onejames mcavoy is an inspired choice as wesley a much harder role than it would appear wesley needs to be convincing as both a putupon office drone and as toughguy superassassin mcavoy deftly handles both ends of that spectrum and also manages the transition between the twoit would be easy to say that angelina jolie is wasted as she has very little dialogue however nothing could be further from the truth apparently she personally cut many of her own lines in an effort to make the character of fox more mysterious mission accomplished she conveys so much through her silent reactions that when she does choose to speak and trust me when fox speaks its because she chooses to it carries a much a greater weightmorgan freeman in a role clearly intended for samuel l jackson plays sloan leader of the fraternity what can you say about morgan freeman he couldnt turn in a bad performance if he to he was suitably morgan freemany yeah thats a word now the actions scenes ooze cool but the movie needs a very large suspension of disbelief if you go into this movie wanting to say things like that could never happen you will have no shortage of opportunities if you cant allow yourself to get caught up in the movies universe it will all just seem silly and vapidis a hyperviolent nihilistic thrill ride that is bound to offend as many as it exhilarates but it worked for meon a scale of 1 to 10 with the matrix being 10 and johnny mnemonic being a 1 gets a 7,fantasy
i just saw the film and going into it i was already hating it coming out i was a changed man is not that bad of a movie in fact it is full of nonstop actionnow i have never seen a matrix movie so i can not relate to people hating it because it is a knockoff regardless the acting in this movie is well done and the comedy is very dark the story is not to bad full of plots and twists and the message of faith is brought up throughout the movieone thing i liked about the movie is that there is no cheesy romance which many hollywood movies tend to have hancock is a good example of it instead the main actor is brought into a world of killings and in doing so reveals some unsettling things that sends him of postalall in all this movie is a must see yeah its not your no country for old men academy award winning movie nor is it your crppy b movie like ben and arthur,fantasy
this film is good action movie with a lot of new special effects because of this reason i would strongly recommend to watch it in the cinema on a big screen i like the main idea of the film when simple clerk are too tired with his life and when he has an nice opportunity to change it i think some people angry on this film because they are exactly this sort of humans they basically did not do anything worth and they just complain about everything so main character in a movie did something important he made a decision he drastically changed his destiny and life i could not go to the further details because i dont want to give spoilers  as a negative part of movie i suggest that some physics laws a definitely abused in the movie so one should be ready for scifi in physics  i believe that film worth seeing especially if you like action movies or if you dont like your boss as for me this is one of the best actions movies that i have ever seen,fantasy
hello folks first of all i must admit i am huge fan of timur bekmambetov and his previous russianinternational hits nightwatch  daywatch although hes done some pretty good other russianonly movies also i tell you that i am huge fan of action thriller movie genre at all and i seldom miss any decent film which comes out of this genreso to start when i first seen trailer  i thought to myself that this movie would be average action fx movie kinda nightwatch themed because i can feel that timur used his same visual style in ithowever when i have watched it  i thought that it is absolutely one of the most entertaining action movies of the springsummer this year of course i have so far iron man as 1 and waiting for dark knight as main summer eventi wont fo into details describing the movie plot etc  theres plenty in other comments i do understand that this movie of course is not perfectthe story is clearly zero and the all it has is a very typical matrix style clichs like the faith concept choose your own destiny it also has some pretty similar parts and even dialogs that were extremely close to the original matrixhoweverthis should not mislead you that this movie is worthless all movie is done as a remarkable eye candy all film like an complete 2 hours fx sequence plot is not smart but the action entertains and great lead actors do manage to keep the tone of the film indeed there are too many slomo sequences but they actually cool there is a dark humor and self irony in that film what else  some graphical and this bullet bending thing  is not done as far as i know in previous moviesthe score and song by danny elfman is clearly great shot to deliver the filmi really laugh out loud when people say that other films has some more sense  come on  this is just action movie it gets you entertainedas a bottom line i just say 2 things 1 i have seen this movie already twice in cinema and will plan to go with my family again this coming weekend 2 today as a first day of start hancock i went to see it too and i found it really much less entertaining thati think you guys thous who say this movie is crap and ripoff need really make your mind how many movies actually dont rip off others ok there was a matrix but what there was for example dark city also if you say that iron man my fave is not a ripoff of a supermen crossed with transformers and batman begins  i would say that you do only jealous that russian director did thatactually you should not blame timur for plot as the script and story was not his as director he did a great job and i already got myself a complete danny elfman soundtrack to this movieok enough of this i this this movie deserves to be watched,fantasy
i quite enjoyed this film first off i would say that one needs to go into it with the proper expectations this is an action movie people not fellini but what i consider the new generation of action movies it may be rife with explosions and car chases but its still got an intelligent edge to it there is some wonderful subtle humour which i completely appreciatedjames mcavoy my new favourite actor plays wesley gibson who is feeling very much like a cog in the proverbial machine or perhaps even just a bolt on said cog his job sucks his girlfriend sucks his apartment sucks you get the point the thing i found refreshing was that mcavoy portrays this role very convincingly and naturally you dont feel its contrived or forced at all he is wesley gibson ever since office space and fight club hollywood has caught on to and played off the concept of the anonymous office underdog becoming the hero it may be something many people can relate to but those of us who can relate to that feeling of lost identity in the cubicle farms of america also dont appreciate being pandered to this is what makes mcavoys performance so brilliant in this film  he is utterly natural he even had me cheering aloud for wesleys triumphs at a few points the basic setup is this wesley gibson suddenly finds his droll life flipped upside down when he is told that he is the son of the greatest assassin that ever lived and now he is being recruited by an order of assassins to join the ranks gibson is faced with the classic internal struggle of whether to take a leap of faith and leave the comfort of his current life which he hates or take the easy road and stay safe and miserableangelina jolie plays one of the aforementioned assassins i am not a big fan of hers shes not a bad actress per se but is highly overrated  and frankly not all that versatile either in this role like most others shes still very much angelina rather than her character fox which is her biggest weakness that being said though she actually toned things down and managed to not try to steal the show from the leads there is some nice backstory on fox which lends to your interest in the charactermorgan freeman is lovely as always i dont think this man could turn in a bad performance if he tried his character is also well written with some good details adding to the depth of his performance terrence stamp also makes an appearance leading to an all out wellrounded castmy only gripe about the film is that the end did seem to drag out a tiny bit theres a bit that i figured was the end and actually would have totally been fine with it ending there and leading to a sequel even with a very obvious lead up like that this happened twice sadlyoverall though the action sequences were fairly original in both setup and cinematography the dialog was realistic with a dash of wit and the subtext of the internal struggle to both find oneself and push oneself to strive for higher goals was a much appreciated and integral addition to the filma good time through and through go see it,fantasy
watching the trailers of the movie had me excited about what i was going to see howeverwhen i read the reviews i found this movie was just another matrix despite this i still went to see the movie and give it a chance in the first scene of the movie a man makes a matrix style jump to a roof top at least a block away when i saw this i was disappointed that i had come to see this movie after that jump everything else in the movie seemed realistic and made the movie enjoyable a moviegoer must suspend their disbelief of the impossibility of curving bullets not only is the movie full of amazing action but there are also snippets of comedy in it watch this movie you will love unless of course youre a complete bore,fantasy
excuse me for my language use the automatic translator the film good i am surprised timur good stage manager and main action director our country this became clear with mediums 90h years on promotional trailers bank imperial see the good cinema rather then shitty which beside you in favor see the european cinema jeanpierre jeunet and great mexican director guillermo del toro you wash the brain your politicians and public people take into account russianhe you will needs in the future see at home among strangers stranger at home and destiny of a man they fought for their country the dawns here are quietbut will already remove us such shitty stupid as indiana jones with skull,fantasy
is really right down that ally of the matrix sin city and shootem up it has all the elements of sly humor intense action and also violent like fight club was the story begins with wesley gibsonjames mcavoy a young filling clerk who feels he leads quite a miserable existence his boss belittles him every chance she gets his girlfriend is quite bitchy and she is fooling around with his best friend and he takes pills to keep him from having anxiety attacks that all changes one day while at the grocery store he meets up with foxanjelina jolie a woman who tells him that she knew his father and that his father who was an assassin after they got from a hit attempt on there lives he is brought to a building and only to find out that the people around are killers led by sloanmorgan freeman killers who kill bad people they want wesley to join them but what destiny will wesley choose quite an enjoyable action flick i must say james mcavoy is so good in an american accent you start to forget he is really scottish the rest of the cast do well also this is a film you would hate to miss,fantasy
tells the story of an ordinary office worker who is in for a notsoordinary future the beginning of the movie could almost be confused with something straight out of office spacewhere the movie pays for its price of admission is what happens after this beginning and it becomes walltowall action at that point the stunts are cool the gunplay is spectacular and as long as you dont think too long about whats going on one helluva ride if i had to find a fault with the movie it would be that there are times when you are no longer immersed in the movie because the actor addresses the camera by looking into it and talking to the audience which somehow seems to briefly destroy the experience as a moviegoer this doesnt last long however and i found myself forgiving the transgression rather quickly without this id rate the movie slightly higher 85 perhaps if i could as it is its still easily worth the price of admission,fantasy
adapted from the comic series by top cow productions is stylishly engrossing and badass to the bone directed impeccably by timur bekmanbetov in his first american film with a cast of alist actors like morgan freeman and angelina jolie its a thrill ride from start to finish 2008 is shaping up to be the best year for comic book movies from the refuse of last years cringeinducing garbage the acting from the major players is topnotch however i found james mcavoy a little irritating at times but hes still solid nonetheless but its freeman and jolie who steal the show with cunning ruthlessness despite being the good guys of the piece along with impressive stunts mixed with sharp acting and dialog and what marvelous stunts there are rivaling those even moreso than the matrix sequels forget live free or die hard and get smart if you want a serious movie about cold ruthless assassins without the tongueincheek goofiness of smart spit that garbage out and see this movie highly recommended,fantasy
ok i went to see this movie todaydidnt know anything about itto be honest i thought it would be a little more from this world but after a few minutes of narrated scenes it revealed its true faceafter watching that guy jumping through the window  building to building  while shooting his gun with an inhuman precision i said to myselfneoyeah it brought me back some memories of the matrixthe action scenes are great packed with cool special effects and weird ballistics but they lack any drop of realismcoming from a movie which takes place in the real world and not a virtual onesee the matrix id say its a bit strange to see bullets curve their trajectoriesnear the ending when i saw wesley take on the whole assassin nest alone and with no cover i had another vision preston from equilibriumbeside this i must admit the movie was funif you are looking for an exciting action movie with an lets say interesting ending then go and see itdont expect it to be a masterpiece but try to enjoy it as it is,fantasy
this movie had great talent angelina jolie morgan freeman even james macavoy had solid performances the special effects excellent good plot twistthe flaw however was in the script and execution if you have watched any recent movies the shattering plot twist predictable in fact even i who never guess movie plots guessed in about fifteen minutes they did not lead up to the ending very well the other flaw was how graphic it was there was unnecessary gore and the slow motion bullets especially when piercing people were excessivehowever the acting and overall story make it a good entertainer if you are bored or just want a light timepass this is a movie to see if you are looking for something deep or mind challenging go somewhere else,fantasy
is the action movie that requires you to believe that the most ridiculous things can happen without much explanation at all as to how or why they happen you just have to believe it now when a movie asks you to just go out on a limb and believe the unbelievable it is obligated to give you pay off for all the effort you put into it doesnt do thismost of the action is completely implausible and the storyline has enough plot holes to leave some scratching their heads and the ending of the train sequence is just completely ridiculous i think one scene that really stood out to me as being stupid is the one where the main character a loser turned assassin by blood and training gets an assignment from the loom to kill a guy in the limo he shoots at the guy through the window and misses so he then has to flip up over the guy and shoots him through his open sun roof my thoughts are if they guy is getting shot at he would have closed the sun roof that was clearly done for the action shot of him flipping the car over the roof the unnecessary stuff like that and the excessive use of slow motion can make this movie seem burdensome at timesi also found the main character incredibly talkative and annoying through out most of his training i found it hard to root for him or connect with him to my shock because i am no fan i think the best character in this film was actually angelina jolies fox her last action in the movie is i think one of the coolest i have seen in a bit morgan freeman does what he always does and the rest of the cast is pretty much forgettableand its not that it doesnt have entertaining moments because it does but it just never makes up for what it asks of you even in the end and this is why i wish i had waited to rent the movie,fantasy
welcome to the fraternity this gun youre holding belonged to your father he could conduct a symphony orchestra with it sloan morgan freemanits never comfortable to find out your estranged father was a great assassin nor is it comforting to know that his ancient fraternity of assassins needs you to avenge your fathers death a little hamlet a bit of matrix and a tad of da vinci code tells of wesley gibsons james mcavoy change from a pussy account manager to a worldclass assassin under the guidance of fraternity teachers fox angelina jolie  and sloan morgan freeman doesnt lack for imagination in its magical realism of bullets bending in flight and wounds miraculously disappearing nor does it lack for clichs and stereotypes of the thriller genre including car chases as good as any others in contemporary cinema after all that cgi stuff is what american films do best often at the expense of crisp dialogue or deep characterizationeven the actors are their own stereotypes jolies fox now thats truth in advertising plays a dangerous operative who can shoot a giant firearm as if she were lara croft freemans voice once again soothes the savages james mcavoy does the toby maguire innocence just right and although jolie has the least dialogue and probably the biggest salary the shot of her backside may be the most memorable image outside the spectacular train wreck high over a gorgeas in so many actionpacked herodriven movies today the hunt is not just for bad guys but also for who the hero is as a person a quest saving these summer sellouts from shameless superficiality fox i knew your father wesley my father died wesley the week i was born fox your father died yesterday in the rooftop of the metropolitan building he was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived and the other one is behind you shoots,fantasy
i thought that had an alright basic plot to begin with this was ruined by a complete overuse of special effects and extremely unrealistic scenes to substitute a lack of imagination in my opinion of course is a much different sort of movie but compared to a movie like no country for old men for example not one aspect of could compare with the coen brothers script rather than keeping the viewers entertained with well scripted well sequenced scenes the movie turned from outrageously farfetched actually impossible event to the other for example trains hanging off of bridgesi think if you are going to stretch reality that far your might as well put wands and potions in their hands and make it a fantasy im sure that some people like that kinda thing however and i wouldnt say the movie is boring it is actually funny at some parts so i wouldnt discourage people from seeing the movie if they are curious but dont go looking for a well written inspiring thriller movie,fantasy
when i went to this movie i didnt expect the get blown away well i was this is the best movie of the summer so far the next batman movie will probably end up being better i just thought it would be and average action movie but it wasnt it was an amazing action movie with great acting once again just like always morgan freeman was flat out great and he had his funny moments in the movie and i also like how he played his role in the movie he does a great job playing the role he did angelina jolie was also just flat out great in this movie too she did a great job playing the role of fox during the entire i never would have guessed what happened james mcavoy did a flat out amazing job also i could not believe what i was seeing when i found out about this movie when i seen who they had casted to play in this movie they got a huge allstar cast of people for this moviethis movie also had great music special effects and everything the camera angles were flat out great the script was amazing the way the movie flowed was perfect and i couldnt believe what i was seeing for the most part i would recommend this movie to everybody even people who are not all that interested in this movie because it is not realistic they will forget all that when they watch this movie because it is great i am not sure if they will make a another movie but i really hope they do it might be kinda hard but it would be worth it so all in all this movie is a amazing movie with a great twist for an ending that you will never see coming,fantasy
james mcavoy plays an accountant who escapes the daily grind to join a fraternity of assassins who weave cloth they weave not as cover rather to determine the name of their next target  deciphered from microscopic blemishes in the weave as has been the traditional for thousands of yearsif you can run with this  and i urge you to try  youre in for a rare treat an innovative invigorating slick suckerpunch of a film thatll leave you clapping with glee by the endthe action special effects and cgi are fantastic but all blend seamlessly into the plot not sticking out like tenuously connected set pieces indy iv take note the violence is pretty brutal but this is action not horror  its all pretty comic book in style as you would expect from a comic book filmmcavoy is brilliant and totally pulls off the full range required of him from downtrodden office worker to action hero and most deftly of all the man in between where most of us reside the american accent is totally believable too in short this film confirms that mcavoy can act brilliantly whatever the rolethis is definitely one of those films you just need to go and see take a plunge the plot patently is ludicrous but this is a two hour cinematic experience sheer entertainment its not going to change your life unless youre an accountant on the edge perhaps its not going to educate you about anything worthy although it is useful to know that rats love peanut butter just sit back and enjoy a brilliant action film quite unlike anything youve seen beforemust see,fantasy
i watched this film in the cinema last week i to leave half way through however my brother had shelled out for the tickets and i didnt want to be rude every film in the cinema has to borrow convention and characteristics from other films otherwise lets face it the mass audience simply wont enjoy and relate to it however timur bekmambetov has taken it way too far the three main characters james mcavoy angelina jolie and morgan freeman play the roles of neo trinity and morpheus theres even the cheesiest most pathetic starwars rip off its unbelievable i am fast losing patience with big budgets and big actors when little creativity is put into the storyline im sure this film will do exactly what it was made to do make money,fantasy
i walked into expected a fun thrilling entertaining movie but what i got was a complete waste of time and money where absolute gore replaces story characters and ever other ingredient that makes a movie watchable the dmn movie couldnt go five measly seconds without a head blowing off or some useless disgusting trash like that that being said i seldom enjoy gore films such as rambo or saving private ryan because theres a real message not just kill as many people as you can in two wasteful hours this was definitely the worst movie ive seen all year and probably one of the worst i ever saw in my life i warn you not to waste your hard earned cash on this rubbish like i didwwwultramovieswebscom,fantasy
i have no idea how this movie got that kind of rating everything about it was pathetic and such a lame effort come on its supposed to be a mark miller creation and look at what they had reduced it to rats the story line has the same old plot of all the super hero tales its boring and very predictable i cant even imagine the way the main character is played i mean he no way looks any closer to the superhuman assassin he is supposed to be i feel good amount of talent was wasted on badly developed characters this is just a pop corn movie it could have been so much better its good to watch when your brains have gone to graze and you dont know what to do with your life,fantasy
to all those who have a vendetta against this film need to leave the film was built with the right amount of action and deep thoughts of life it is built like fight club and matrix were mixed into one amazing movie the self loathing wesley is easy to get in tune with for a lot of viewers until he joins the guild which most people would love to join in his spot the plot was not weak or pitiful the entanglement of the weavers and past guilds helps make it more in dept with the past of humans guilds of assassins have existed before so to have a movie with them in the modern day is a must the actors dont let down on their roles they play the parts given to them with great understanding of who the character is and do it in a way to entertain the whole audience hearing morgan swear is a must for any person who has seen his various roles including god in bruce almighty,fantasy
i took my girl friend to see this action packed movie staring angelina jolie she was the best part within minutes of the start she my girl friend not angelina was not impressed very bored in fact my girl friend go to sleep as it was very farfetched looked liked it was based on the matrix style of filming not everyones cup of teathe f word was used to much too no point of it just makes the movie poorerone of the opening scenes was a farfetched car chase the chase was between a high power sports car and a delivery truck the race goes on for a long while smashes bangs bullets shot at each other cars parts falling off wish my car was built like theirs it was well beyond me how a delivery truck could keep up with the sports car absolute rubbishif you managed to sit through the car chase well donewe stayed for almost 30 mins until a scene was showed of young man having the st kicked out of him this was our final straw the film did not need that clip complete unnecessary violence if it was dropped we would have probably stayed till the end unfortunately or fortunately we did not we up and left the cinema if your girl friend is sweet gentle caring and emotional like mine dont take her get it later on dvd where you can fast forward the brutal sceneshope this is of some use and who ever wants to see their girlfriend for a another date stay away from this movie,fantasy

wesley gibson james mcavoy is a loser he hates his job his boss abuses him verbally his best friend is sleeping with his girlfriend and he has no money this is just a short list of the problems that wesley faces which thanks to the power of pills he is able to manage somewhat his life is a empty shell and he drifts through the days as if he were in a dazehowever one night everything changes when a beautiful woman who is later known as fox angelina jolie saves him from an assassination attempt wesley finds his life turned upside down it is then that he will learn the true meaning of fate and what it means to be a mansounds good right well the problem is that once reaches the point of no return and wesley discovers who is supposed to be then does a very unfortunate thing instead of using a good story with interesting characters to drive the movie uses the tired idea of having cgi effects to tell the events of wesleys transformation granted is a summer movie and one expects such films to be over the top compared to past season movies the problem though is that this is easily overdone and whatever story once existed is ignored for the sake of explosions and impossible chasesa another example would be the curving bullet scenes ignoring the laws of physics we are never told how such thing can be done despite hints of a special power that a few have relies on effects like this to amaze and to drive certain plot ideas this is great but the whole movie cannot use this single idea to make the movie worth watching this is portrayed as the pinnacle of the franternity memberss powers but we dont have enough to go on to believe that there is little reason to go into the details of and that includes the twist because there isnt much to tell this is too bad because there were hints of some interesting ideas like the question of fate and free will are we responsible for our actions is it moral to kill 1 to save a 1000 as fox tells wesley and what about this secret order known as the fraternity lead by sloan morgan freeman we are not told enough about the origins and working of the fraternity to really care how was it formed we know it trusts a loom for a secret language but how has the group survived for so long without being detected once more a good movie would have told us these details instead of focusing only on cgicgi effects do not make a great movie like so many others is entertaining but not to the level of being remembered years from now610,fantasy
i went to see this the other day and it was fantastic i havent enjoyed the action scenes that much since the matrix the people who believe this is a rip off from the matrix and other similar movies need to get a grip there is obviously going to be influence from the movies that have shaped the industry and has took these influences to create a great moviethe story line is pretty good your never bored at any point during the film the acting from james mcavoy shows why is one of the best up and coming actorsfor all the poor reviews ive read i just cant believe your comparing it to other movies such as the matrix its most likely you all went to see with that movie in your mind and compared every little thing to it if you go by that standard i guess any movie where people can do things out of the ordinary is a rip off of the matrix,fantasy
the first screen in reads a thousand years ago right there and then i knew that i had chosen the wrong movie to see that nightjames mcavoy who was fantastic in last king of scotland did his best ed norton turn as the protagonist loser who finds his true calling in lifetoo bad that calling involves killing peoplebased on what oversized sewing machine tells youin binary code no im not kidding i didnt realize that morgan freeman and angelina jolie were hurting for a paycheck that badif youre hurting for useless bullet time special effects at least matrix revolutions,fantasy
i really was not impressed with the trailer for this film i went for 3 reasons i think angie jolie is the most beautiful woman in the world i kind of liked the directors style in nightwatch didnt see the other 2 in the trilogy and the kicker was the solid reviews that made it sound a lot better than the trailer looked i am glad the reviews pulled me in because angie could not have done it alone i never paid for tomb raider because every single movie ever made from a video game pretty much sucks in my opinion this is a film you really must savor on the big screen the action almost never lets up and when it does there is a solid fun story going on is the premise ridiculous absolutely who cares i just hope they make a sequel because i am under the impression it is adapted from a graphic novel that i would expect may be a series i would make another comment about that but i want to avoid any spoilers go see this film now you will not regret it,fantasy
is a movie about a group of assassins who kill after certain process reveal the name of the targetassassins here take under their wing an individual who suffers from anxiety it is so as if the individual is son of former super assassin and has the same qualities which just need to be polishedthe super human abilities appear to be fantastic what i liked is that if a human being is able to cross the limits of his or her body than physics wont be the problem physics would support such assassinsall the action in finding out the truth about father truth about the process revealing names of target ditching boss leaving cheating girlfriend making new colleagues as friends and further killing them its all carved out beautifully,fantasy
has an interesting enough premise an ancient group of weavers branches out into assassination and a thousand years later a bored office clerk learns he is one of themthe actors are competent the moment morgan freeman walks onto the set the movie gets credibility and angelina jolie is always a pleasure to watchother reviewers have praised the overthetop humor but this is where loses me i liked some of the humor at the start and i can even accept the curved bullets but im less keen about the matrixlike stuntswhere really loses me though is the overthetop silliness it becomes so silly and so unreal i couldnt take it seriously you lose the sense youre watching real people and it feels like a video game cars and people do absurd stunts and you quickly get a sense no one gets hurt unless the plot calls for it and the people who do get hurt are jerks or unknowns so no lossim intrigued at the gritty reboots we are besieged with which is not the least bit gritty might explain this we want a bit of reality in our movies enough so we can say well maybe this could really happen its the difference between campy old battlestar galactica and the gritty reboot with james edward olmosthe source material is reportedly itself campy so i cant fault the producers on those grounds but i want characters i can care about and root for some reviewers enjoyed but it feels too much like a video game to me its a slick effort with good actors so i feel bad for giving it such a low score but it couldnt hold my interest a clever plot twist towards the end is pointless if the audience has already switched off or gone to sleep 410,fantasy
yes this movie is that bad not art film bad like eraserhead waste of beautiful black  white film just plain bad yes other action movies have stupid and unbelievable scenes i can suspend belief to a point curving a bullet trajectory uhdoes someone understand physics if it wasnt for my friend grabbing my shoulder and trying to get me to just try and watch further i would have walked outtwicethe premise is plain stupid the twist even more stupidbut no there was no thought not even entertaining action jolie isnt good looking enough to carry the film i actually was hoping the cia would show up and liquidate all the characters in the film because they all were basically retards with guns no characters to identify with no plot even an action nut needs some kind of story next time hollywood pick a good comic book to use not awful ones then again they botched the green hornet too,fantasy
i have only just gotten round to watching this film and although i am not its target audience im 64 i just loved it james mcavoy proves his versatility as an actor i have yet to see him in two roles that are alike and he carries it off with aplomb jolie is as dropdead gorgeous as ever and i was delighted to see marc warren hustle in a supporting role the only jarring note as he always is for me is terence stamp who seems unable to deliver any line convincingly  no matter what the role may be luckily stamp has a very brief role in this the action is pretty relentless mainly physically impossible but truly imaginative and really excitingthis is the sort of movie where you check your incredulity in the minute it starts  if you can do that you are in for a treat my wife hated it but it is a boys movie definitely i would like to see a sequel if it could be done as well as this,fantasy
by some considerable margin the worst film i have ever seen and my first one star since about 2002  and only 1 because 0 isnt an optionit is a complete mess from the first scene they even have to whack up some background info about th origins of the fraternity 1000 years ago which you learn effectively translates as weve made up some nonsense wont make much sense but basically anything can now happen no matter how utterly implausible it will be the first third of the film is a simple enough insight into mcevoys everyday life interspersed with the most banal excruciatingly pathetic slowmos editing and special effects and i use the term special in the loosest possible sense and from then on it goes downhill once the fraternity get involvedfreeman looks completely bored with his role jolie is woeful in a role ive seen her in at least three times before and ample reason to turn it off by about 23 of the way through you got the impression they realised they had another hour to cram into 20 minutes  the transformation of mcevoy from someone having seven bells beaten out of him to wanting to learn the minutiae of his father and the fraternity seemed to be about 15 seconds  and this a father he never even knew half a day earlierthe plot and the rules seemed to be made up as they go along ive no idea where any of the passengers disappeared to on the train carriage as it hung from the track you get to a point where you suspend disbelief so much no more so than the absurd car chases that it was anything goes  anything can be done slowed down somersaulted over flown through  never mind its only a filmbut a dire one,fantasy
this movie has been described as dumb but funny and entertaining well i found not a single joke except for the concept of cult killing people by commands of some cloth producing machinery that was so dumb it was actually hilarious on the other hand the movie is filled with pathetically bad cgi action sequences which actually make matrix 2 and matrix 3 to be reasonably good movies the word is geometry here so we have hero illogically attacking in straight line because it looks good or full circular kill because circle is so pretty there is no logic no laws of physics no believability in all measures this popcorn flick falls way behind very acceptable action movies like 96 hourslike previous movies of this particular director day watch night watch the script is a mess the former have been at least original and they have had some interesting concepts in this case it tries to mix a lot of other movies together matrix star wars casino royale la femme nikita and pumps it with so much caffeine and adrenaline that the result is simply just a very fast moving vomit the script really looks like a result of brainstorming of 10 years old but it is immoral and profane beyond any limit seriously there is nothing even remotely good in the movie the postal was similar but postal was meant as a parody and was actually funnywhat i find totally ridiculous is the message of the movie the hero is narcissistic whining loser turning into completely amoral narcissistic bastard yet this is somewhat supposed to be seen as a progress morgan jolie  are you serious to spread message about helping poor in africa after participating is such gun porn so what is the message of the movie really are you bored are you not satisfied with your relationships with you work dont be a pussy lets kill a bunch of people good is bad and bad is fun yes that is it seriously there is no friendship there is no good there is no purpose there is no need to cry for civil causalities dont be pussy and do something fcking great for yourself im absolutely astonished i seriously do hope everyone understood the message of the studio dont be pussy and do something evil just for fun so start copying this movie for free and dont give these corporate bastards not a singe penny because you know not paying for content is evil buy paying for that is good but again good is boring and evil is fun you are not pussy so you will not work in your boring job to give them your hard earned money especially for such trash,fantasy
i would have given this a 1 but the effects were okstill i was too fascinated to sit through this thing i saw the whole thing standing up aghast with macabre fascinationi watched this as id watch the fresh corpse of a mediocre composer decompose in slow motion before my very eyesthe language was pointless the plot was thin the message    well the attempt at a message    was puerile at bestit left a pasty taste in my mouth as cannibalized bits of other really good and poignant action films were regurgitated into this amalgami think id watch it again just to see that one really cool bullet deconstruct thoughi guess morgan freeman had nothing better to do that day   ,fantasy
inane film where an anxietyridden accountant tells off his boss when he discovers that his father belonged to an assassins group he is then trained to kill the man who killed his fatherthere is nonstop killing everything appears to be happening on trains we have an unleashing of rats and finally the man who did his dad in is killed by our herothats when the plot to this miserable film thickens turns out that the man who he killed was really his father naturally as is the case with all these brotherhood related films there has been treason within the group its leader morgan freeman had begun to pick out victims for his own selfish gain when the real father discovered this he was eliminated and freeman chose the son to do this as he knew that the father would never shoot his own sondespite nonstop action the film is the perfect clinker it becomes overly violent and angelina jolie looks like she is off her mind freeman appears to look much older and leaner here one wonders if he is ailing,fantasy
a very nice film fast plot  quickly successive scenes the effects are really intriguing  modern the viewers emotions struggle trying to compensate meanwhile he trances in agony for the final outcome the change of sides in the middle of the action is so nicely performed when it is revealed to the main character that his father wasnt such a villain  dark motivated assassin as they him to believe the dilemma set during the last scene about killing all the assassins in order to maintain the code or just kill wuesly so that we will prevail  own the worlds fate is amazingly tantalizing for some moments immediately the thought of why not killing sloan  keep the assassins joined in a common effort for the good of the world came in my mind as a third solution i aint think though that angelina was going to give this kind of sad  meaningful solution ok i understand that some or many scenes belong to the sphere of unearthly imagination or that there are unbelievable solutions to certain confronted situations but hey guys this is cinema this is being lost  left to enjoy be part of fictitious environment,fantasy
has everything that youd expect great action good acting angelina jolies ass and for it to be awesome is all of those things that i just listed is a badass film the movie has everyone cussing even the great morgan freeman saying motha fcka it has tons of blood and tons of headshots and is far from a disappointment i surpassed my expectations is the story of wesley gibsonjames mccavoy a guy with a cheating girlfriend backstabbing friend and boring job he is always being yelled at by his fat boss one day while in a convenient store he is rescued by foxangelina jolie fox takes him and introduces him to the fraternity a group of people who have the ability to curve bullets wesley soon finds out that his father was murdered wesley is trained and begins his hunt for his fathers murderer but some things arent quite what they seem is an amazing film not only because its the matrix of the decade but because its a great film its exciting filled with rentless action and sex scenes it also has so funny moments in it is a great film that may even be better than the matrix maybe i wont go that far but is up with the matrix,fantasy
possible spoilers im always fascinated by recent angelina jolie movies i could make a drinking game out of how many poutinglip scenes there are this movie starts out actionpacked and never really stops but soon the cgis get old the slow shooting angles grow redundant and there are plenty of yeah right scenes after a while the defiance of physics and medical reality bored me like the train that falls down a cliff several hundred feet with people walking away and later being shot stabbed and blown up without feeling a thing oh and by the way did you know a bullet can travel in a circle going through several heads in the same spot no matter how tall they are without losing velocity yeah whatever,fantasy
if youre an angry 17 year old boy you might like this flick otherwise you will soon realize that youre wasting your time and moneybending a bullets trajectory so it can curve really  jumping through a glass window and then across from another building and at the same time killing 4 bad guys really  this is not an action movie its scifi at least the matrix was meant to be a scifi movie the overly skinny angelina jolie cant save this movie neither can morgan freemanfor those who liked this movie i recommend another one the girl next door its the same audience they try to reach,fantasy
tries extremely hard to be the new defining action movie for the year but it falls far short every clich is present from the wimpy protagonist that gets tough to the over the top car chase scenes and finally to the body count which is still rising as we speak james mcavoys character is a poor mans version of toby maguire in the spiderman series mcavoys comedic lines come off silly and seem out of place his transformation from a nobody into a world famous assassin happens seems very abrupt and happens with about the same adversity as daniel in the karate kid the action scenes are eye catching and the special effects are the strength of the movie however many times they scream yeah right as opposed to producing oohs and aahs seems like it was written in a junior high class which also seems like the audience who would enjoy this movie the most the problem is that with the amount of gore and violence the target age wont even be able to see the movie in the theaters if you are looking for a deep complex plot or catchy dialog then is not for you if you are looking for a good two hours to waste watching some great cgi special effects and a quick glance at angelina jolie naked from behind then is a movie to check out 410,fantasy
i went in to the movie with lot of expectation because its trailers had a great impact on me and after watching this movie i can say that this movie came good on my expectations movie is just great and it had lot in it great story nail biting actions great performances by all the actors talking about story it was excellent and very well told story had a lot of twists and turns in it which were unexpected it was basically a story of a simple guy who is always searching for his identity then he meets some people and his life becomes a rollercoaster ride and in the end he proudly says i know who i am now talking about action one of the most attracting feature of this movie they were just great car scene was just excellent in this movie you will find bullets curving i dont know how the hell they do it but i tell you it looked greata unique concept performances of all the actors were fantastic names of jolie mcavoy and morgan freeman should be mentioned here overall this was a great movie which had everything for every body so guys and girls just want themy rating 910,fantasy
yes it is i bought this movie yesterday for my friends birthday which made me realize that i hadnt reviewed this film yet i saw it when it came out on the first weekend when it was a rainy day in quebec and my two friends invited me on a night out between friends we chose this movie because one of my friends had already seen walle the other had seen get smart and all three of us werent very enthusiastic about the incredible hulk so we decided to pay for this movie and all three of us to see it first this film is like a good french expression says tir par les cheveux which in other words means that this film is highly unrealistic so if you dont like unrealistic movies i suggest you dont watch this filmthe story revolves around wesley gibson a man who constantly suffers from panic attacks and his life just isnt right no more his girlfriend cheats on him with his best friend and his obese anorexic boss janice keeps on putting pressure on him at work that is until he meets a woman angelina jolie named fox who works for the fraternity a group of assassins led by sloan morgan freeman after a tough physical training wesley isnt the same man no more he confronts his boss attacks his friend and believe it or not learns how to curve bullets heres our ratings sam thats me 9510 alex my friend 9510 andrew my other friend 610 i think the reason why andrew was less enthusiastic about this film is because he doesnt really like unrealistic films but he was highly surprised by the level of action and of story for once we can actually enjoy a high level of violence without having to turn our brains off but the reason why me and alex docked our points off a bit is because of the films level of stupidity which can be pretty high sometimes for example and do not read ahead if you do not want to read spoilers the end scene where fox shoots a bullet that goes through the head of every member of the fraternity except sloan and wesley that circles around and eventually kills her too now that was a stupid scene but that doesnt ruin the movieif one night you feel like watching an action packed movie is a good choice,fantasy
this movie surprised meliterally expecting cheesy action sequences and a lame script was fresh funny gory and meaningful destiny fulfilled being the message my only overall objection were the abundance of fbombs though you hear it in everyday life it sounds juvenile so many times however the best thing were the performances hands down james mcavoy really changed and became an assassin and who can resist morgan freeman as a bad guy jolie of course kicks ass as always maybe not as good as in mr and mrs smith though overall this movie was a thrillride with outofthisworld special effects if youre looking for a pickmeup of a movie i recommend it listen for freemans motherfucker mcavoys last line and jolies last curved bullet no pun intended enjoy 7510,fantasy
i loved the car scenes too and the sniper shots this movie just rocks all the way from the stairway to heaven 910 stars angelina jolie she was good lookinghot as yeah you know it had a great story about the brotherhood and such one thing that i did not understand was that the last thing wesley said was  what the hell you doing lately someone that knows explain to my slow brains or is it just a thing he said or well enough of that i thought that the only thing that was bad about this movie was that the sweet sweet angelina didnt talk too much  hehe worst reason to hate it  back to you all have a nice day and week,fantasy
the promos made me go wow over the action scenes and angelina jolies new avatar with smoky eyes and tattoos visible there was not much more in the movie than the trailer the plot begins very well but ends up pathetically a software engineer is kidnapped by jolie and morgan freeman who head a secret fraternity and is made believed of his elite assassin lineage when he is able to shoot the wings off three houseflies when a gun is put to his head the movie progresses with a boring and somewhat gory training in the fraternity and then he is ordered to kill people from the loom of fate a loom that gives names of targets through binary code hidden in weaving errors of the fabric a twist comes towards the end and excellent rajnikantstyle bullets that can curve in mid air are used extensively the end pisses you off and makes an otherwise good movie turn average watch it for the sexy angelina and some good stunts in the first half but keep your brains at home,fantasy
in classical greek mythology three sisters known as the fates were responsible for allotting life spans to humans one of the sisters spun cloth which represented a human life whilst the last sister cut the cloth which ended a humans life at some point in time offers a variation on this story with a millennium old secret society known as the fraternity supposedly reading cryptic writings found from clothe they weave and thus determining who fate has decided to terminate the fraternity are assassins with almost superhuman capabilitiesthat is the prelude to this movie we are then introduced to wesley gibson played by james mcavoy in the present day he is a put upon office worker who secretly wishes for a better life one day it appears that someone is trying to kill him and fox played by angelina jolie comes to his rescue and informs him that he is descended from a member of the fraternityeventually gibson decides he wants to be part of the fraternity and become an assassin like them his initiation is very brutal and bloody so on that level this movie isnt really suitable for youngsters as the violence and gore is quite confrontingstylistically this movie is a bit like the matrixusing similar kinds of visual effects if you like realism in your movies this popcorn fantasyaction movie wont be your cup of tea jolie makes a playful yet deadly assassinits an interesting performancethis movie will appeal to people who like to daydream bighere the central characters are like greek heroesdemigods who dwarf the abilities of ordinary human beings the greek connection is also kept up with some plot elementsthe story of wesley gibson has elements of greek tragedy to ityou cant honestly say that this movie always makes senseincredible action scenes will hopefully make you miss all the plot holes of this movie its hollywood style wishfulfillment the question is asked of the audience what are you doing with your life the scriptwriters seem to imply that unless you are a highly effective killing machine your humdrum life is worthlesspresumably writing derivative scripts is a step up from gibson does for a livinga derivative but enjoyable movie very violent though not as good as movies it borrows from like the matrix etc69100,fantasy
i have given 6 out of 10 for this movie the reason is angelina jolie she was too good although i cant agree that the casting of morgan freeman was wrong since shawshank i think morgan freeman was a nice casting since shawshankbut there are some confusions with the script likecould it be scientific i dont think so and the story is not fictional either so what is it somehow the scripts are so poor in hollywood this days except the dark nighti think this film is quite enjoyable in theater for its action effects and sound but i m sure u will not remember this film after leaving the theater,fantasy
ok here is what annoys the living daylight out of me why cant people view a movie as it is supposed to be just because the hulk turns green and u cant no matter how hard you press in front of the mirror or you think its stupid that spiderman can climb walls when u fell down trying to get through your window when u forgot your keys does that make the film stupid i know these films kinda suck but trying to make a point here my point here its like watching a drama movie of a struggling single mother and complaining that there werent enough car chases and gunfights this movie gives you exactly what its supposed to great action scenes lovely dark humor and fantastic entertainment for action loving fans with an open mind watch this movie,fantasy
many comic books and action and fantasy films focus on empowerment the protagonists of many of these thinkluke skywalker peter parker and harry potter are thought to be rather dull people of course no one knows about their secret identitylife usually these characters are taken out of their normal day by an older wiser figure and taught the ways of a hero is just this with james mcavoy as wesley gibson a boring account manager being whisked out of an ordinary life by fox angelina jolie ms fox is what id call a superassassin and she hands him over to sloan morgan freeman sloan reveals he is heir to the skills of a master hitman and has a place in the fraternity the fraternity are a secret society that was formed by an order of weavers receiving coded messages from the loom of fate these messages give them their targets who they are required to assassinatethis plot is merely a way for timur bekmambetov from night watch and day watch fame to stage some truly amazing action sequences and when i say amazing i really mean it although many of them defy all laws of physics they provide escapist entertainment in the highest form the train sequence is probably the most intense and mindblowing scene i have seen in an action movie this year since this isnt bidding for an m rating the fights are bloody and gruesome in particular wesleys training process headshots galore mixed in with brutal fist and knife fights pervade the fight scenes but in a good way through these scenes we are left to decide are these guys really that good throughout the film it seems that question always sprung into mind which lifted this from a mere blockbuster levelthe acting is good from everyone involved mcavoy boyishly charming and sometimes scary carries off a tricky role and proves he can hold his own in an action movie as well as literary adaptations angelina jolie looking gorgeous as always has never been more charismatic on screen unfortunately she has barely any screen time and about 6 lines if ever there was a case of an actress being underused this is it freeman plays the usual father figure in the first half but takes an unexpected turn in the climax in a year filled with lackluster summer blockbusters serves up the good a cast with great chemistry stupendous and bloody action and enough twists turns and surprises to fool viewers who think they know the storybekmambetovs is indeed in this viewers opinion it may not be the best movie out there but damn it it is one of the most entertaining35,fantasy
i saw the trailer of this movie so i could not wait to watch it i pretty much got what i wished for maybe even more but i still subtracted 3 stars for the following two reasons1 1 star lots of plot holes if you want to know more read a comment that contains spoilers i recommend the one entitled why why why from 30 june 20082 2 stars the main character people seem to like james mcavoy but i really really dont i think he cannot pull off a character like this the movie shows some similarities to the first matrix fortunately not too many where keanu reeves could play a superhero or check out hancock with will smith thats a superhero even if in the beginning hancock was a drunken bum i think james mcavoy is even worse than tobey maguire in spiderman and his monologues are lamelamelamethe rest of the cast is ok angelina is perfect for the part and morgan freeman can play anything and anyoneanother small complain is the impossible action scenes for example i made some trajectory calculations and it just doesnt come out even the ones that do are impossible to execute by a human while this is not a flaw next time please put scifi among the genre listif you are a fan of action movies you should definitely watch this oneupdate after watching the movie for the 2nd time james mcavoy does not seem so bad so i raised my vote with one star another thing i noticed is that the headshots are extremely brutal so go ahead and watch the dvdupdate2 after watching the movie for the manieth time i just realized its kinda like a lite version of fight club but in a more fantasy setting it seems i like the movie even more every time i watch it,fantasy
my bottom line is this if your are expecting a movie that obeys all known physical chemical and gravitational laws and that nothing about it should be deviant from what you already know then go watch discovery channel or national geographic if you wanna spend about an hour and a half just being entertained by and action thriller then this movie fits the bill there are some scenes that are brilliant simply brilliant you just cant help but gape at the screen just by the sheer brilliance of the direction and cinematography there will be again some more scenes where you just wanna pull your hair out cos its so incredulous bullets hitting bullets and curving the path of the bullets by flicking your arm are just some of the things that begin to make you think this is one stupid hell of a movie but believe me the way the story has been taken through though predictable doesnt leave you unfulfilled you almost just cant wait to find out whats going to happen next cos its gonna keep you guessing any which ways the acting is splendid anjelina and mcavoy have played their roles to perfection and freeman though a small role plays it with panache the music score is ok nothing spectacular but the camera work and the special effects are nothing short of spectacular for sureagain i warn you dont go to watch expecting to be convinced but go to watch the movie just for the pure thrill of watching an excellent action movie,fantasy
may i say that the movie is out there to beat every action movie i went to watch agent 86 and then decided to watch needless to say that i like action movies but while it was more of a comedy in agent 86 here it was more of a drama and all the twist really had me from that moment on i was like ok best movie in a while theres just one minor detail that i hated and that was the part where fox killed herself i understood why and all but come on girl your life is more important than one machine called destiny i guess thats the difference between me and a believer who truly believes in what shes doing the ending with the death of sloan was flawless and all i could say was wow nice work of the director and the writer as well angelinas character was good and all and i can even say this being impartial since im one of those that hate her for being a cheater and all if you havent seen it yet i truly recommend you to go check it out the movie is amazing and much more than i was expecting when i first went to watch it,fantasy
that i enjoyed very much this is definitely a guy movie where your willful suspension of disbelief will be thoroughly tested if you can get through the movie without saying bogus more than once or twice youre doing very well however the main character is fun and appealing even though he starts out as a wuss so too is angelina joline although she looks almost as emaciated as a holocaust survivor comeon eat a cupcake or something she does a good job with her character throughout the film there are times where the plot or dialog are so outlandish that i found myself smiling at the screen out of amusement the godfather or gone with the wind this film is not it wont receive any awards and it doesnt deserve them but it is a fun movie and a good way to spend a hot humid summer afternoon if you and a couple of your buddies are looking to get out of the house its so short youll have time to get a beer afterwords,fantasy
this movie drew me in with good previews and a surprising rating on this site come on who wouldnt want a chance to see angelina jolie curve bullets and tear stuff up so many movies like this have all the good scenes in the previews and the rest of it leaves you drooling wishing you stayed home to watch dancing with the stars or some such dribble this movie did not fail to deliver the movie went out of its way to develop the main character and was surprisingly funny the action was as expected over the top but fantastic to behold some plot parts were super predictable but there are some nice surprises in the movie this is an enjoyable movie but if you are really found of rodents you many not want to watch this movie,fantasy
first and foremost i did not go and see the movie just because angelina jolie was in the film actually that was one of the reasons why i wasnt jumping off the couch during the trailer commercials to go and seebut husband and i went to go to the movies and besides walle en espanol that was the only other one at our local theater worth watching it is action pretty much from beginning to end if you are into not a lot of talking and more action  this is the film for you the characters werent as welldefined as i would have liked i love to see morgan freeman in badass character roles  its so out of the norm for him the curving of the bullets reminded me of the matrix and instead of putting more unique action in the movie it seemed that this movie was all about curving the bullet i mean they kept doing it over and over again enough alreadythere is a really cool scene where jolie is using the new military rifle that shoots around corners very nice  i just seen that one on future weapons other than that the story line is a bit cheesy she is all gungho about the fraternity but really no one person made the movie overall i give it a 710,fantasy
great movie do not downplay it because most people would not know that this movie is based off the comic book written by mark millar this movie is not some halfwitted film the movie didnt follow the comic book as it was loosely based it deserves a 9 for the originality it portrays much separation and fine differences but fine similarities nonetheless this film is quite different from your standard hitmanassassin movies either or i suggest people should see this film one for the fact it has a great story two the film is quite original from the comic lastly this movie will leave you saying holy mother let me see that happen one more time,fantasy
this movie has potential james mcavoy does a decent job in his role as an average joe who transforms into a ruthless killer angelina jolie works her magic as a goddess of sex and death and morgan freeman knocks em dead with his spoton portrayal of the paternalistic but decidedly sadistic ring leader the action is nonstop in a nice way what the movie lacks in substance it makes up for in aweinducing effects that suspend us in a state of mindless heart pumping excitementwhat i cannot fathom is why the creator of this film had to ruin what would make a perfectly entertaining if not terribly enlightened summer flick with disturbing violence that takes on a distinct fetishistic quality and morals so distorted they could hardly be called such ends up bordering on a snuff film or at least someone peaking inside the fantasy of an angry teenage outcast who plays too much grand theft auto it takes the concept of comingofage ragstoriches and twists it into a mangled horrorshow that says one thing above all else killing is cool being a human being with no friends no life and no heart is bad ass and really gets the girls  its what makes a man the hardest part about watching this film is that i could not hate it it had its funny moments it had a likable main character and profound special effects clearly however somebody decided that they needed to make a mindless actionthriller into a powerful daring statement about society and instead created a vicious abomination somebody ought to have stepped in and made some changes before this piece of actionpacked filth got to theatres this is not anything you want your kids watching in fact i think it really says something about the people who participated in the making of this  these are not people who make acceptable models for our youth this sort of thing ought not to make a single pennyin the end the only thing that really kills is any idea of responsible filmmaking,fantasy
i did not enjoy the movie the first time the amount of violence brought me to sleep after 10 minutes the second time i fell asleep immediately so in that sense the movie served a good purpose angelina jolie looks like she also needs a good sleep cant somebody tell her she should eat more too cause she scares the hell out of me maybe time to switch to horror and james mcavoy come on man you can do better then this why do great actors often make this same mistake by switching to this kind of genre while they were doing just fine such a shame and morgan freeman  im losing respect here so please do something about it hm i just dont understand a lots of unnecessary violence for what its just a silly movie,fantasy
the movie was no matix i can tell you that much there was no real scripting and a lot of gun play the action part of the movie was the most exciting part when they started talking i to throw up you can guess the movie ending 12 way through it i would say this is a dvd worth movie i know they usually put out all the crap in the summer time but usually one or two might be really good i was hoping this would be one of the better movies but you will have to judge for yourselfi would tell you thought that the men might like this movie my spouse said he like the movie however he did feel it was lacking a proper reason as to why they had the extra power,fantasy
on imdb this film is tagged as action  thriller basically i walked into the theater expecting action packed movie not a ridiculous comedy movie now dont get me wrong  i liked several scenes jokes but the liner at the end of the movie and the humor  action mix badly thats why this movie fails in delivering and please dont dare to compare this piece of garbage to a masterpiece such as the matrixthis movie isnt a comedy and isnt classified as one anywhere its entirely patched with ridiculous clichs while the whole concept of curving bullets in the real world is really hard to feed to your brain even shutting it down would not helpinstead one could have watched scary movie 3 but at least know its a stupid comedy  parody with some patches of action taken from action movies such as the matrix etcin a summary lots of scene were ridiculous especially the opening scene where the guy flies from a building to another add the poor music with it it seriously sucks at that point i turned to my friend and laughed i even watched that same scene again on youtube and i wouldnt change my mind regarding how poor it wasthe rats kill the whole movie at the end as its really the dumbest encounter that no one would expect of an actionthriller movieangelina jolie acting was perfect but was physically and anorexic thin it sort of made her acting looked fake as she seemed to struggle when she had to carry heavy those heavy weapons to pump some action the chasing car scene was enjoyable yet over saturated by unnecessary cuts here and there to fill in the blanks and make the scene last longer eg angelina jolie spreading her legs bending forward on the car with her guni do agree the acting was perfect however the script was terrible and overhyped in addition the story is easy to follow but gets ridiculous and exaggerated and you will have several wtf momentsoverall 510  if not even less but im being generous for my first review of a movie,fantasy
im not gonna liei was very unimpressed with this movie i give it a five based completely on some interesting action sequences and angelina jolie considering that i am a young male moviegoerthe first problem that i had with the movie has to be the amount of unnecessary oneliners those kind of comments havent worked since arnold was heavy in the movie business and even then i only liked them because they were funny also as said before i am in my 20s and i still think that movie had too much cussing it actually distracted me from the storyline which was awfulthis movie had weak characters that did nothing to get the audience emotional involved with them and i felt nothing but regret for going to the movie when angelina killed 50 of the characters with a single bulletfinally to top it off the movie ended with a another oneliner what the f have you done lately that did nothing but leave a bitter taste in my mouththe only thing positive that i can say about the movie was that it had some captivating action scenes even though the camera work was so shaky i thought i was going to have a seizure sure it took after the matrix but i cant knock a movie for following in the footsteps of one of the greats,fantasy
is that summer movie packaged solely for adrenalinedriven audiences its heavily stylish its violent and it stars angelina jolie too bad theres not much in the way of a good original storyjames mcavoy plays wesley gibson an office guy who has to deal with dwindling financial resources a terrible boss and a friend who steals his girlfriend when hes not looking but all those pale when a problem presents itself as an assassin who seems bent to kill him thats when wesley meets fox jolie a mysterious woman who saves him in a pharmacy shootout and through a maddash chase in busy streets he eventually learns of the fraternity a group of super assassins of which fox is a member and of which his dad was also a member and that whoever killed his dad is out to kill him as well thus begins a training led by the fraternity leader morgan freeman for wesley to get back at the guy who apparently murdered his fatherbased loosely on a comic book by mark millar and jg jones is a noholds barred violent article that benefits from director timur bekmambetovs highly stylized vision bekmambetov director of the visually assaulting but emotionally distant night watch series shifts to the fifth gear and rarely lets up although the directors combination of frenetic action and black humor is a case of hitandmiss affair but all sensory gratifications eventually wear down when the matrixesque narrative and the twist seemed to be ripped from the screenplay pages of star wars start to wear downmcavoy makes a perfect case of a loser for his character at the start of the film and finds a believable spot for his characters eventual transformation jolie is hot and really is there any other reason for audience to care freeman brings his charismatic authoritarian figure but his character becomes more ludicrous as the film progresses which is punctuated by an amusing expression by the actor towards the endin the end brings to the table everything you expect from a summer action movie its stylish but it doesnt have enough substance to back it up to keep it from being truly memorable as my companion said its not really a failure but it doesnt really succeed either,fantasy
every actor and actress played a vital role and it did suit their imageseverything was great from story till the direction must see if you are an action fan and also if you are angelina fanthe story line was a different and direction was beautiful the stunts were organised well there were lots of graphics involved and it did give proper touch to the movie it is one of the best action movies in my books and i cant wait to have it released in dvd so that i can add to my collections i could not believe here in uk it was going to be houseful everyone had smiles in their faces when they are out of the cinema it really made my evening go good and this was the first time my girlfriend liked an action movie thanks to the whole team who made,fantasy
i can confidently say that this is the best loom based hitman movie no scratch that the best loom based movie full stop that i have ever seen containing some quirky crank inspired moments such as a keyboard that spells out f you when it is smashed across the face of someone unpleasant if you can get over the physics defying bullets then fear not will provide you with all the non threatening morally ambigous violence you ever switch off your brain and have a thoroughly consistent time and let us not forget classically trained actor morgan freeman who swears like a trooper at the end of the moviefreeman  loom x assassins  hit,fantasy
i must preface this with im an absolute sucker for action flicksthere are multiple topics on the message board stating how this movies physics are impossible making the movie not enjoyable if you went into thinking that it would be realistic you must not have seen any of its publicity because every trailer and summary that i have seen gives an accurate representation of the contents of the movieit is completely unrealistic but that should be expected and instead you should focus on how visually stunning it is the cast is beautiful and the effects are fantastic the plot had some unexpected turns but in the end you should think of this purely as an action movie the viewer must go in appreciating its ingenuity and physicsbending ideas and simply enjoy the ride,fantasy
is based on a controversial comic of the same name written by mark millar it will be hard to believe for those that see the movie without having read the comic book but the film is actually toned down the fraternity has their own code of ethics they are doing what they feel is right and are unconcerned with and unapologetic for any collateral damage they train wesley in the ways of their world special baths that accelerate healing the power to slow down their perception of time thereby increasing their own reaction time and the ability to bend the trajectory of bulletsand lets be honest it looks pretty damn cool tooling around chicago in dodge viper killing bad guys and using angelina jolie to make your exgirlfriend jealous makes for a fun friday night in my book,fantasy
based on the graphic novel by mark millar is the latest in the long line of the summer onslaught movies based on comic books but this isnt a movie for the whole family its more of like an adult version of jumper which premiered a few months earlier and the simplistic plot is very close to its predecessorwesley gibson james mcavoy is a nobody he works as a cubicle drone in a huge nameless company his only friend there happens to be having an affair with his girlfriend and his corpulent boss abuses him every chance she can get no sooner are we introduced to him do we then get into a series of slambang action sequences as wes learns that he is a son of a former high ranking member of a secret order of assassins and is endowed with special gifts the ability to pump his heart rate faster than normal which allows him to see everything in slow motion and with a faster response time and has the ability to make precise shots with pistols by somehow bending the laws of physics that allow bullets to shoot behind obstacles to find their target wes is soon joined by his mentor the deadly assassin fox angelina jolie and head man sloan morgan freeman who trains him in order to go after a renegade of their order thomas kretschmann but as the story unfolds all is not what it seemsthe action sequences are very much matrixlike with slow motion photography that makes each explosion seem like a work of art every headshot is graphically shown as each perfectly shot bullet goes through skulls which is why i wouldnt recommend this movie for young kids even though its supposed to be a comicbook summer blockbuster with timur bekmambetovs expert direction he was the one who did the night watch series which turned into a smash hit in russia and gained cult recognition in the west the action scenes are very well done it seems that foreign directors might actually be better imitators than the locally grown talent when it comes to creating such wild mayhem unfortunately most of the characters are stock derived and with a movie that focuses on the action there is very little character development mcavoy has an acting range that is more versatile than other action stars in his generation vin diesel and the rock basically play themselves while orlando bloom and hayden christiansen are absolute bores but he doesnt have much to do other than to scream when he gets beaten up and he does get beaten up a lot to the point of sadomasochism in this film but there may be hope in that he can blossom much further although being short and wide eyed tends to go against the action hero mold my problem is that i could not gain any sympathy for his character other than the underdog symbolism due to the fact that he was a nobody to begin with angelina jolie is probably the closest character with any sort of background in the film but it tends to get overshadowed by her tomb raider style of acting and her character seems to have a minor role in the entire story i would have loved to see the movie focused on her character rather than mcavoys morgan freeman and terence stamp who plays as a mysterious counterpart to freemans character are both wasted since they get very little to do or sayall in all i would rate this a 6 out of 10 good solid action sequences but the lack of likable characters is a serious drawback,fantasy

no one really expects action films to believable right of course not theyre meant to be fastpaced and make the audience say whoa and holler in excitement while watchingso why do they so often insist on attempting to be deep especially when they do so poorly at it lo fate take control of your destiny did you catch all the greek mythology references lachesis atropos and clotho spinning weaving and snipping the thread of life good for you you can now feel proud of yourself for being as deep as the creators of this dreck and just for an extra dose of adolescent pretension lots of swear words delivered in a deadly serious manner from the opening humdrum introduction to humdrum wesley through endless ridiculous plottwists and special effects to his final philosophical pronouncement this is me taking control of my life what the eff have you done with your life lately honestly was this written by a 14yearold,fantasy
after watching this film i am left speechless it is one of the worst films i have ever seen and i have seen many many films i really dont understand why so many people like it i personally like action films but this was beyond horrible the action was overthetop maybe thats what bugged me so much i understand when a film is supposed to be unrealistic but this one was really too much it really challenged a viewers suspension of disbelief seriously it is for braindead morons i wish i could give it a 0 rating ugh also why does angelina jolie look a decade older than she really is seriously she still looks good but not for her age,fantasy
here we go again this is another dreadful movie inspired in some comic that i never heard before and that im planning to read after seeing this ugly mess with an stellar cast ugly visual a incredible lame script and boring charactersthis was made by timur bekmambetov the director of the horrible film night watch however is even worse than that dumb flick being stupider and more irritatingwas an awful film it was completely cheesy but not in a good way when i saw the trailer of this at first i thought that it was some sort of joke or a spoof of the matrixif onlyi really had a miserable time watching this movie sometimes i wish that imdb allows the negative rating because that is what this atrocious film deserves,fantasy
this movie was awful everything about it suckedthe visuals were horrible the visuals of watchmen were much betterthe characters were annoying and stupid i hated all of them angelina jolie and morgan freeman played some stupid and uninteresting character in this ugly messthe plot was basic childish and predictable it was like those boring rambo films lost of action without plot or any interesting characterthis movie was awful and doesnt have any single redeeming value it is one of the worst films ever made and it deserves zero stars because it is a pretty bad filmis a horrible film there want anything good about it,fantasy
saw this by mistake in the theaters awhile backthe ticket taker led me to the wrong theater cant remember what i actually came to see but i sat down and the usual commercials started playing then this thing came on and i thought hope this is the last one and the movie will startwell it turned into the longest commercial i ever remember seeing at the theater i kept thinking wow theyre really stretching the limits on what they think well tolerate on commercials these daysso 15 minutes into it and im thinking what in the world is this commercial ever going to end as far as commercials go id pretty much had it it looked another horrible angelina jolie imsuchabadass movie and made a mental note not to ever see this piece of garbagethen ding it finally dawned on me that i wasnt watching a commercial i was actually in the wrong theater nonchalantly got up and walked out got in the car went home,fantasy
in one word can be described as pathetic its a complete waste of time and money i fail to understand why morgan freeman had to sign such a stupid movie i am not going to discuss about the story because frankly there is no story in this film its just dumb action which is not all soothing to your eyes there are many weak points in this movie the one being casting of the main lead james mcavoy you watch him in the last king of scotland and then you watch him in you would realize the difference you would hate him in as much as you feel pity for him in the last king of scotland angelina jolie looks disgusting this is by far the worst appearance of jolie this is one of the worst action movie i have ever seen and its really baffling to me that this movie has a rating above 6 on imdb the users who have given good ratings to this one doesnt know what film making is all about i would recommend to watch any bollywood flick instead of this unmovie,fantasy
i expected this to be a mindless action but such a stupid story is an achievementreading in cloth for the names of ones next victim bending bullet traces jumping a hundred meterand not to forget lots of bullets intercepting each other this and much more idiocy you can find in this matrix wannabe without the matrix explanation for it of course cant understand how anyone could like anything in this movie  stupid story dumb and not even good looking action one can not talk of acting at all with this script seriously this could be a music video but not a movie  lots of wasted money againby the way  im really not sure how the title relates to the movie  and maybe it should be help,fantasy
so you probably heard that was a pretty decent movie well im here to tell you you heard wrong this is a movie wallowing in its own absurdity and nihilismmcavoy puts on a fairly decent lead performance when the movie starts his character is a loserly desk jockey whose girlfriend is cheating on him and he gets yelled at by his annoying boss these scenes are funny but a little clichd as soon as he becomes an assassin he stops being a loser hmmthe term suspension of disbelief is just begging to be used here ok so they expect the audience to believe the following that certain people can slow down time by sheer adrenaline that you can bend bullets while in this slowdown and that you can defy every law of physics while in this state taking this as a comic book fantasy im willing to look the other way to a point but theres things that happen in this movie that are beyond impossible like shooting a bullet through a can a donut a train and into a guys head from 50 miles awaythe way the assassins get their missions is also completely ridiculous somehow a giant weave makes a code kind of like the viking norns and gives a name of a person to be killed why are they being killed its not important the assassinations take on a sadistic quality and at no point did i care about any of it even more sadistic is the fraternity itself who constantly beat the living daylights out of each other like some kind of fight club then heal themselves with some mysterious waxy substance all of the fraternity characters save one are poorly developed and i have to say angelina jolie is miscast she has the looks for the role but not the range she just didnt fit the characterthe last 30 minutes or so of this movie need special mention there will be spoilers aplenty here so be warned there is a big train crash scene where about 200 people die but the only important thing is that mcavoy kills his target who turns out to be his real father and then somehow he survives a 500 foot drop into a river he gets rescued by terence stamp of all people in a surprisingly decent expositional role apparently the fraternity isnt the real fraternity and morgan freeman was killing people for profit how exactly does that make him a profit anyways everyone at the fraternity had been targeted by the almighty spool of thread and are therefore evil so mcavoy busts in and brutally kills all his friends angelina jolie kills herself and morgan freeman escapes only to be killed later did i mention that this movie is really really upbeatone of my biggest problems with this movie is that its predictable everyone who seems evil actually is you know they have to end with a big action scene so at some point the fraternity have to become the bad guys it sort of evens itself out by making every underdeveloped guy evil but simply by the tone of the movie you know how it has to end oh and apparently mice can drink gasoline without dying and become walking time bombs seriouslytheres a couple of decent action scenes in this movie and the script has its moments but overall this movie is bad to its core its sheer ludicrousness and nihilism make it not worth the time,fantasy
this movie just stinksno sugarcoating no the actors were good but the plot was lameit just stinks i have to admit im a huge fan of the original comic its fun its hardcore its evilbut its awesome i was thrilled when i saw the trailer forbut then i came to realize they took out all the good parts let me elaborate the movie roughly follows the comic to the point where wesley is brought to the fraternitythere the similarities end in the comic wesley is to become part of the organization of the secret masters of the world  an association of supervillainsjust to give you an incentive to go and get the comic when fox and wesley first meetfox kills an entire bar full of people just to prove a fing point the sad thing is this movie could have been great if it had stuck to the original material it would have been able to compete with sin city or 300but the director seems to not have had the guts to make a movie where the protagonist is a villain,fantasy
i watched this movie very well aware that i was not going to see a piece of great cinema everyone who sees the trailer for this film knows what hes is getting into as did i so placing a comment about a stupid plot absurd action or bad acting would be silly for those are not things one should even be hoping for with a film like thiswhat you want  and what is fair to expect  is a couple of thrilling action scenes nononsense dialogue some beautiful women and a pack of bad ass heros nothing more nothing less there is nothing wrong with this sort of film they can be great funso now the but but what you really do not need is a director trying to put all sorts of stuff in the movie that really have no business there  that try to deny the sort of film that it is that pretend to be part of something much greater that insult your intelligence as a viewer and ultimately ruin your evening because you feel lied to deceived you were tricked by the clear shallow surface but stumbled into a filthy sea of sticky nothingnessso i am really interested to know what on gods green planet that commentary on the supposedly boring lifes of civilian people was doing there and why they felt urged to have some scientific nonsense explain why there simply is a limited amount of people on earth that can do impossible things this film is so full of pretentious bullshit you are continually fighting to oppress the vomit trying to spurt through you throat and all you want to do is punch someone who had anything to so with this garbage the last line is maybe the worst ever because it completely confronts you with the fact that youve sat through nearly two hours of torture voluntary,fantasy
this film stank from the first to the last minute where to start the bad language was totally unnecessary its not swearing per se thats the problem that has its place when used well as do any other words its that this just isnt necessary and it spoils the dialogue when used so liberally and by everyone all the time my wife described it before she gave up on it and went to bed as jason statham does the matrix which i think sums it up nicelysure the action was interesting but so totally unbelievable in every way that it just looked silly even allowing for the fact that it was a comic book script it was so ott in this respect that i found it impossible to lose myself in it the way i can in films like v for vendetta or watchmen the total disregard for human life is often an issue in these sort of films although it can often be excused given the context of the film but here the gratuitous scene where the fraternity take out a train full of passengers presumably sending everyone except our heroes of course plunging to a horrible death is deeply deeply flawed filmakinglastly just how much do you want to flag up an ending in fact the many twists and turns were so obvious so far in advance that only the laziest of viewers would fail to see them coming a mile off lazy and flawed filmaking againhad i paid for this id have demanded a refund one of the worst big budget movies ive ever seen hated it and deeply disappointed in morgam freeman particularly,fantasy
this movie was truly the worst movie i have ever seenif you havent read the comic then feel free to watch it however if you have read the comic and have even the slightest shred of respect for its author then please boycott this movie and spare your brain the misery that is the movieboth my house mate and i have read the comic so we had very high hopes for this movie after enduring the whole movie we both had to leave the house for a smoke we were just so shocked and appalled the only way i can describe this adaptation of the comic is as a heinous raping it was the most sickening awful disgusting attempt at an adaptation i have ever seen i feel sick even thinking about this movie no other movie in my entire life has left me so disappointed what more can i say,fantasy
wesley gibson isnt exactly leading the life of his dreams hes stuck in a deadend job presided over by a tyrannical bitch his best friend is having sex with his slattern girlfriend his bank account doesnt allow him to retrieve 5 and he suffers from random panic attacks that send him scrambling for his pillsone evening while refilling said pills a pretty woman arrives and tells him his father whom he had not known since birth was assassinated on a rooftop the day before she then embarks in a furious firefight against a wouldbe assassin with wesley caught in betweenif you think this is about as tense as it gets for him think again in this action movie directed by relative newcomer timur bekmambetov is a skillful mixture of highoctane fights and chases interspersed with storyweaving and character development both aspects are done remarkably well  nothing stellar perhaps but better than your average action flickanyway the movie takes a little while to settle in allowing us to meet and understand the protagonist and the woes of his pathetic life and although the pacing can be a little on the slow side at times its never really annoying or limiting for ones experience of the film soon wesley is brought into a group known as the fraternity a thousandyearold secret organization of assassins that carry out fates dirty work by killing marks chosen by a sort of prescient loom now seeing as you yourself probably had to read that doozie twice imagine what poor wesley must be thinking  and not only because he finds hes able to wield a gun for the first time in his life to shoot the wings off a bunch of flieseventually he decides to join the fraternity after quitting his job in a rather beautiful manner yet his training is less about instructing him with assassination skills and techniques and more about beating cutting and berating the living crap out of him one could wonder what beating a man to a pulp over and over again has to do with training him to become a more efficient killer but perhaps thats all part of something i dont quite see eyetoeye with anyway moving onthe storyline is a long and archaic one full of twists that are as unpredictable as they are intriguing its also about as plausible as mankind ever deciding to commence world peace from men jumping hundreds of feet from office tower to office tower to a young and average man suddenly possessing marksmanship talents to make bob the nailer lee swagger jealous the action sequences in this movie while exhilarating and pulsepounding are remarkably lacking in credibility or realism thankfully the special effects are wellenough executed to hide this fallacy and the result is an incredibly implausible yet highly entertaining action feature the whole movie is basically like the matrix only minus the swooshing trenchcoats cool sunglasses and evil computers we even have a form of bullettime such as several creative and stimulating shots of bullets colliding in midair though any reference is likely to be unintentional and merely the product of my overdeveloped criticism musclethe acting is strong and solid james mcavoy is credible in his performance as poor wesley gibson and angelina jolie is as powerful and seducing as ever as the enigmatic and ruthless fox morgan freeman is once again cast as a wise allknowing old man this time as the leader of the fraternity sloanthe movie has several instances of grotesque images or dialogue from a pointlessly vulgar vernacular to some rather troubling shots of blood and gore not to mention a particular scene near the end that will make any animal rights activists explode one can debate whether such graphic content was really needed not that i mind all that much it just seemed slightly forced  or inversely unrestrained but overall quite unimportant  noones gonna be offended by a few swear words or bullet holes when they go to see a movie about a bunch of professional assassins unless theyre retards     for hitting the screen with brilliant action sequences that unfortunately somewhat lack in the credibility area i award 75 curving bullets out of 10,fantasy
this aint no popcorn flick its pure garbageit tries too hard to be cool and bad ass a movie with an attitude with the way the music lines and scenes were executed it was also completely unbelievable for some things to work you have to lay out your basic game rules and create a world thats based on those rules otherwise its just random stuff popping out of nowhere with no explanation and no reason at all thats the case with it just makes no sense the only reason i endured watching the whole movie was because of the 70 rating imdb gave it i truly fail to see how it got ranked so high there was no entertainment value at all everything was so unrealistic to the point of fail  like for instance the car flip or the 360 bullet near the end i was cursing out loud at that point it was unbearable hollywood at its worst,fantasy
this movie is very easy to sum upwhat the  have i done lately hmmmwasted two hours of my life some of the things that were woven into this movie were so far fetched that i couldnt believe it did i expect it to be rooted in reality absolutely not i am quite capable of watching a movie where i have to stretch to believe that something could happen or where special effects make up for a lack of character a good fantasy is entertaining as well but there is no way that any amount of special effects a plot twist not that you couldnt see it coming and angelinas a can save this filmi to like this movie i really did but im so glad i didnt pay to see this film in the theater or rent or buy it,fantasy
unsatisfied with his life wesley gibson mcavoy joins a group of assassins to hunt down the man who killed his fatherfrom trailers may seem like an ordinary action thriller with a stereotypical list of characters but bekmambetovs picture is very diverse from your run of your mill conventional genres with a truly intense twisting plot and a bizarre choice of directionas good an actor as mcavoy last king of scotland is he cant do anything about the stereotypical hero character he plays bored with life feeling he has more potential hasnt found love etc these conventions of a central character wont surprise the most optimistic viewer sadly angelina jolie tomb raider and morgan freeman million dollar baby are also stereotyped and thankfully the plot makes them slightly differentis sharp fast and importantly interesting and diverse this film fulfils the action genre with guns chases and fighting the thriller genre is also justified through the intensity of the central ideologygibson has joined the assassins to hunt down the man who killed his father and though this may scream that idea of unsung hero defying odds to get retribution there is a charm about the approach in this picture despite logic saying that the clichs and conventions of scenes and ideologies are repetitive the action and likability about the picture will keep you hooked right till the very twisty end with one of the best final lines to a film in recent yearsthe approach is made intriguing through the direction very sharp and sophisticated bekmambetov is able to create an artistic action thriller with a slow down motion as bullets fly as the pounding in gibsons head gets louder we are given this stylistic vision of slowness and is so different and bizarre that it simply has to be admired there isnt one bad shot in the entire film and credit to bekmambetov who has changed the ordinary view of an action thriller into a piece of arthis advancement and directness help create that cutting edge to the film and we are thrust into gibsons life head firstthe plot is exciting and always interesting if some scenes are predictable and unrealistic there are many twists and turns along the way which makes an intriguing thriller with excellent direction if not the best characters,fantasy
this is not a good film i dont care what anyone says i went to see this film with so much expectation that i was left disappointed it just goes to show how filmmaking has become formula and how originality has become synonymous with unbelievability they took a great cast a director with outofthisworld aspirations some mindblowing special effects on the shaky foundations of a crappy storythis is not a good film i repeat it was sloppy in some parts relied too much on special effects and looks like a hormonefueled fantasy of a fifteen year old did this movie go through any developmental process there are so many loose ends and lets just say that for someone who is a diehard scifi fan i didnt believe any of the crap these guys were dishing out believe it or not there is a line where outrageous becomes ridiculousi feel sorry for the true filmwatchers who still remember what a good film is because with a rating of 7 for this crap the worst is yet to come may god help us,fantasy
wow i was not expecting to like this movies at all because it was so different than the source material they were actual super villains in the comics but it was really good james mcavoy was a good lead and you cant miss will angelina and freeman the action was really clean and quick with slick special effectsthe story follows a dead beat loser who has a crap life and nothing is going for him he is recruited into a league of assassins after his father who was part of the league was assassinated they train him as he has potential to be as good as his father and they need someone skilled enough to catch his fathers murderer i dont know how some message board people criticize movies for having a bad premise when it is based on a book or graphic novel thats just kinda ignorantanyhow excellent flick be ready for some twists,fantasy
i was very looking forward to watching the movie morgan freeman and angelie jolie  cant get any better but i was really really disappointed the loom part was new but the rest was quite boring i nearly dozed off in the middle of it there was no actual acting that really caught me attention and the only action part that i may give a bit of credit to were the parts where angelina jolie was in a car which was already spoiled by the trailer most of the good parts in the movie are already seen in the trailer there were some bloody parts that were unnecessary and very repetitive and i disagree that the movie has any resemblance to the matrix sorry a no no for me and i wouldnt recommend the movie,fantasy
what i have to say wont occupy much space and time as well as this flick does not occupy many neurons i realise that most of the viewers will say that this is an action movie and it does not need to pack too much but seriously now we have angelina who has less lines than that bitchy boss so that makes me consider she was placed there for her fame and beauty then we have freeman a nice voice and character for the allknowing boss and a bunch of thugs each good at a particular job oooookaaay and theres the plot your dad was the shiznit so you must be exactly like him start taking hits and throwing bullets like you were born being this sciencefiction super shooting hero the entire movie seems to be exaggerated and the only thing that made me watch it until the end was the fact that i was really expecting something but then again so you must be seriously kiddin me with this story line id like to believe that the script was made during that famous scriptwriters strike cause it smells like roses big time and oh yeah use jolie and freeman on a title and of course the audience is guaranteed but what about the quality this reminds me of movies like 88 minutes or simone who had pacino written almost as large as the title for hmmm i dont know maybe publicity,fantasy
a story involving a progeny of some sort of super heroic assassinssome good action sequences  some impossible combat techniquescurving bullets around corners  jolie all these make this a good one time watch nothing beyond thatsome what like the matrix a normal guy doesnt know he has some powers in him people approach him make him realize his powers and he becomes the best in businesslittle unrealistic because a textile loom generates a binary code which are the orders who to assassinate next preventing them from making a unforgivable mistake in the futurethe boss turns out to be the traitor the enemy turns out to be the friend the hero takes revenge typical stuff,fantasy
wesley this is not me this is just a motherfacking decoythis is definitely one of the most entertaining films to have come out this year and by entertain i mean mindless campy fun and reeks of awesomeness maybe filled with plot holes as big as jupiter but at least they made it up in the area of visual style served with a side platter of sizzling action theres a lot of cussing too and they got morgan freeman to say the word motherfacker how cool is that initially i would have given this a four but hearing morgan freeman cuss is just pricelessthe car chase scenes would make speed racer proud the bullets have minds of their own and lead actor james mcavoy masterfully disguises his british accent to embody the perfect american loser turned bad ass this is what makes this film so damn irresistible top to that you have natural born fly guy thomas kretschmann in a very crucial role to the film plus angelina jolie in her bad ass form seriously she was born to be a bad ass in films thats why i loved mr and mrs smith she has this natural spunk in her which makes her cool without even trying i think its the look and those lipsnow i know a lot of people dissed the film because its a a ripoff b the story doesnt make sense and c it is pretty stupid thats probably because you didnt leave your pseudointellectual mindset right at the doorstep films like these you dont have to take seriously and i quote the joker on this one why so serious take it for what it is a very entertaining film and i think youll be alright now dont just facking sit there reading this bull and i highly facking suggest you facking go see this one like right facking now,fantasy
had a lot going for it mostly crazy action scenes never before seen like this if ever comical narration and good acting plus the ever hot angelina jolie who i think really has gotten even better looking this comment will be short just to say that really is good and full of action fuel the story makes sense and while it may be odd who cares many comments on here have pointed out that us normal americans aka those of us living here are too dumb to realize that this is a horrible movie maybe we just realized going into it what it was an action movie focusing on what may i ask the action to the attention seeking critics who give this movie poor review get the stick out of your butt and stop thinking youre better then everyone it makes sense its original and action packed enjoy this movie,fantasy

reserve ready for his role as an assassin gibson will be taken under foxs wing being tested on the street by killing his first target always desiring in his heart to kill cross but gibson has no idea who hes really after as a twist throws his new life into absolute turmoil making discoveries which will certainly have him questioning his choice for accepting his path into the fraternityfolks if you are going into this film expecting something deep and cerebral you are in for a rude awakening logic is completely left on the backburner and you will have to suspend disbeliefis a ridiculous thrillride which wishes to exhilarate you with nonstop action and bloody violence through astonishingly good special effects the film has characters with superhuman abilities doing impossible things with gunsand more importantly bulletsand cars their bodies sustaining incredible blows scrapes cuts and bullets jolies fox drives with one leg while laying on her hood shooting at cross over her car fox actually crashes a car into a moving train in the jawdropping derailing sequence where gibson pursues cross bullets curve when fox shoots at an incredibly difficult angle with her gun going around a hanging pig hitting the bullseye of a target behind it in another incredible scene gibson masters this art where his fired bullet goes around foxs face with the wind actually moving strands of her hair cars completely flip over as assassins shoot their marks in midflight the opening assassin is killed by cross from an incredible distance cross has a specially made bullet with pieces that split apart as it travels before the sharp point goes through the marks head gibson in the powerhouse finale goes through a warehouse of weaponequipped men even taking their guns from them as he shoots them

middle of the film completely shifts the entire plot as gibson makes an astonishing discoveryconcerning cross and his actual reason for being chosen by the fraternity that has him facing unparalleled odds jolie who is a great actress with range who wishes to play multifaceted characters is still a born action heroine her fox is quite a character shes got that sexy and cool that a lot of actresses would love to have but only dream of achievingshe looks great driving a car shooting folks and getting out of a hot tub naked her opening scene in the grocery store as gibson turns around that defines why shes such a coveted commodity fox says little and lets her skills at deathdefying feats do the talking this film wouldnt be near as good without her i think many will enjoy the development of mcavoys character who is run through an emotional grind from start to finish and seeing him toughen as the film continues is rather fun freemans effortless presence and command is here once again his fate is rather nifty the film is a smrgsbord of john woo james bond  the matrixthe balletic gunplay with outrageous and mindbogglingly performed stunts and action setpieces and bloody carnage with bullets penetrating foreheads and torsos the assassins in this film mainly fox cross gibson  his fatherdavid oharaachieve miraculous deeds while trying to kill their targets throw your hands up and just watch the movie without giving the plot much effort its popcorn fodder which might just dazzle you even if you are constantly rolling your eyes at what you are witnessing the daily activities of poor gibson are quite amusing as we see just what kind of misery this guy so wishes to escape terence stamp has an important supporting role as it pertains to gibson and the father he never knew,fantasy
i suppose i went into with decently high expectations i a hot action packed action flick this summer and i figured would deliver now thats to say that disappointed in fact it was stunning visually with some outlandish and very cool stunts and tricks and plenty of blood and gore and angelina jolies very shapely buttyou cant really talk trash about any of those things it just felt like they tried to do so much in the film tried to really make an in your face intense action film that it suffered a little because of it the lead character didnt feel like he fit into the grand scheme of the film and he goes through such a grandiose change from average joe to professional killer that it happens too quickly and you lose something from it they take a really cool idea something original and drive it home but they over use it again and again by the time the film is half over youre so tired of the curved bullet fiasco that you dont care really i think they took an idea that would have bullets flying stocked an a list cast and assumed that the rest of the pieces would fall into place without a really strong story and enough content to cover a trilogyi dont necessarily blame the leading man james mcavoy for his performance i mean i think he can act but his character has too much going on and goes through such intense changes in a matter of 45 minutes of the film and then only gets the other half to show off and hes just not believable sometimes its fun to see the average joe suddenly kick some ass and the scene where he goes nuts on his slightly over weight boss is absolutely classic but as an action star i just wasnt feeling it i think he should stick to drama and take some better written roles angelina jolie is everything they her to be in this role sultry seductive sexy dark and mysterious but her character doesnt exactly get to let loose with any huge moments and we know she can act the amazing morgan freeman is still amazing and probably one of the best parts of the film as the equally mysterious sloan and i really to know more about him but they never give you that either freeman seems almost frustrated in the movie because they arent giving him enough to work with terence stamp makes a small appearance as his second big role of the summer first being a great role in get smart while his energy adds to any cast they give him next to nothing as well thomas kretschmann is good as fellow killer gone rogue cross but surprise surprise he is given nothing to work with do you see the pattern director timur bekmambetov obviously has a flair for style but its mostly wasted on what could have been a great story and thats what i from it was all these fireworks and pretty displays and then it just fizzled when it was time for the meat and potatoes of the whole deal he had some real talent involved in this film but it was slapped together for a summer blockbuster which for the most part has been doing well im not telling anyone to not see because a good action flick is hard to come by and it will entertain you and probably leave that adrenaline feeling in you when you leave the theater but when that dies away youll be left feeling empty and wondering where the rest of it was i cant see them doing a sequel to this because i dont believe any of the cast would return but if they did they would have to find a much better writer and a film crew that would be willing to give some depth to a story that has piles of potential give the story to luc besson and he would have blown you away with it i promise the twist to the whole story is forced and kind of annoying and doesnt really set you up for it at all so go see it and be ready for lots of amazing action and some really amazing stunts including some very intense car chases which were wicked cool but just dont sit there waiting for a story to develop 7510,fantasy
this is the first movie ive ever really to review this is because it is the first movie after indiana jones that i enjoyed yet really dislikedjames mcavoy stars as wesley gibson a nothing accountant who is constantly screwed over by life until hes roped into the fraternity a group of assassins who feel that their mission is to create order with the help of fox angelina jolie who acts her part well yet looks too thin to seriously kick anyones ass and sloan morgan freeman who always does well wes transforms into a talented killer who after several major plot twists finally takes control of his lifethere be spoilers ahead my concerns with this movie however are the slowmotion scenes this movie obviously is quite a bit like the matrix but i still dont like those scenes in the beginning they were crappy weird and irritating once explained they got somewhat better however i never truly enjoyed them and i feel that if used more sparingly they couldve been more effectivethe idea of the fraternity assassinating to create order all the fraternity members manage to do is kill tons of innocent bystanders with their unnecessary gimmicks this in no way creates order but rather is a weak excuse which brings us to the loom of fate you could take this many ways other comments have mentioned it as a correlation to the ways that many blindly do whatever something tells us to we dont think for ourselves this is interesting and a cool plot point but it still disturbed me greatly the one thing that disturbed me more was the blind acceptance you can say sloan was a bad guy and he was but at least he thought for himselfit would make my physics teacher cryhowever i enjoyed the acting and if i had the choice to go again i probably would i recommend people see it and make the decision for themselves,fantasy
if you go to a movie for entertainment  this is a movie for you if you go to a movie for the artistic value of it then stay away from it i personally take the movie for what it is and i greatly enjoyed it its fun action packed and a hot chick is in there  if i have to sum up this movie make comparisons  i would say at the face value its a mixture of the matrix the corridor scene equilibrium the gun fights and the logic behind their superiority and the enter the dragon fighting climaxes moving up killing the villains to get to the main boss if you liked those movies above you should enjoy this one as welli think james mcavoy did very well in this movie i liked him in the last king of scotland but he could not really shine in front of the mighty forest whitaker this movie is all about him there is hardly a scene without him once he comes inall in all is a fun movie to watch for its action graphics and stunts,fantasy
when i found out they were making into a film i was slightly intrigued i had read the comic book of the same name by mark millar and jg jones several times although i am not an allout fan of the comic the subject matter was definitely interesting enough to warrant a good movie i later found that the movie would deviate greatly from the comic all of the comics original ideas seemingly replaced by trite and overdone action movie concepts thus i watched the film with low expectations hoping at least for a mindless action film the film exceeded my expectations and with a little suspension of disbelief proved to be an interesting and entertaining interpretation of the comic while i still believe that the original concepts from the comic supervillains ruling the world would have made for a more innovative film a guild of assassins is far more accessible to the general public an interpretation that may irritate some diehard fans of the comic but not counterproductive to the film itself much of the film follows in this fashion concepts are introduced that are more of an exercise in the suspension of disbelief some may find the bullet curving antics and concepts of fate distracting but dwelling on these insane concepts takes away much of the fun of the film its a dark comedy along the lines of fight club with intense albeit silly action the rrating is well deserved as the script is riddled with obscenities both verbal and visual the acting is nothing special alisters angelina jolie and morgan freeman offer standard performances protagonist james mcavoy does make an impression as a disenfranchised blue collar worker turned assassin visually follows the pattern of many modern day action films rife with bullettime sequences and over the top car chases does not offer much in terms of substance but its fast pace action is sure to entertain those who welcome it,fantasy
that movie is a great entertainment the stunts are brilliant angelina jolie is as sexy and deadly as her usual self and james mcavoy is just cutethe whole idea of is that a secret society called the fraternity is assassinating bad guys in the name of a good cause the way they do it apparently is so extraordinary and dazzling that is worth making into a movie i have to say they were right bear in mind that the whole thing is so farfetched that is right next door to the galaxy far far awayyet as much trilling and exciting the fact thoughthat it is based on yet another comic book makes it more acceptable and digestibleand explains all the scifi excessivenesswesley gibson james mcavoy is an average guy with an average job and an average life identified by the people pushing him through it and controlled by the very same ones he calls friends he is so average he hasnt got the guts to stand up for himself angelina jolies character fox shows up though and turn his world around showing him he can be more than he could imagine an assassin like the father he had never knewthereafter are high speed car chases gravity defying escape sequences good old face punching and bullet bending watch out for that one the film is smashingly spectacular literally and figuratively speaking and a treat for the eyes there are some things that i just couldnt swallow though like the way they choose their killing targets  a rug seriously a binary system applied on the rugs threat and then transcoded onto letters that form the name of the person who is supposed to die seriously that was a bit disappointing and what a surprise that morgan freemans character has been tampering with the codes and the names that come up my surprise is how this fraternity survived for so longthat motto of theirs kill one and may be save millions is just a lot of rubbish in an attempt to kill that particular one they have deliberately destroyed a supermarket crashed dozens of cars and knocked a whole train full of innocent people down a bottomless precipice causing inevitably their death i think they need a new motto or just a new bossthe movie is still great to watch and spectacular to sit through there is plenty for the eyes a lot for the guys and a great deal for the imagination immerse yourself and enjoy,fantasy
i dont usually say things like this but theres just something about that brings out the boy in me so youll just have to indulge me is awesome seriously awesome well its awesome and also oddly preachy and condescending out of nowhere and i guess if im being completely honest it is also ludicrous i mean essentially youve got this guy wesley gibson james mcavoy and unbeknownst to him he is the son of one of the worlds greatest assassins apparently the ability to hit a target in the most impossible of scenarios is passed on from one generation to the next see i always thought it skipped a generation but im hardly an expert on the subject meanwhile whats he doing with this gift nothing he is sitting around wasting his time as a number cruncher in a cramped little box i mean cubicle while letting his supposed best bud get away with nailing his girl on the side i apologize if that was offensive to any female readers but really got my testosterone pumping frankly i dont know how this wussy little pushover even managed to get a girlfriend but he can also shoot the wings off flies so his having a girl is pretty believable by comparison by the way shooting the wings off flies  awesomereally what is the more ludicrous scenario here is it any more unbelievable that there is a thousand year old group of assassins out there who kill bad guys before they fulfill their bad guy destinies than the reality that a vast majority of humanity gives the bulk of their lives away to the bad guys every day contributing to their own slow deaths when you think about how many of us are giving up our dreams our hopes and our control over our own lives its a wonder more of us dont get up and become killing machines in case you havent figured it out yet i work in one of these lovely boxes i swear every day im there its getting a little smaller so yeah my friends had to hold me down to stop me from standing and cheering loudly when gibson grows a pair and tells his boss to stick it before slamming his ergonomic keyboard into his best friends face there isnt a day that goes by when i dont want to tell everyone i work with who hopefully never read my work exactly what i think of them before breaking out into a musical number with full choreography announcing my departure uh sorry my testosterone must have dipped there for a second no problem though another screening of will fix that contemporary visual innovator timur bekmanbetov crams so much manliness into his first hollywood feature that men everywhere who see it will inevitably walk out with their hands firmly grabbing their crotches they may even spit who knows youve got colliding car chases furious fistfights enormous explosions and angelina jolie the best part about all of this is that bekmanbetov ropes it all together with unpredictable ferocity sure there are unavoidable matrix inspired action scenes but once those are out of the way the action always feels fresh and excitingly innovative and while the stunts and scenarios are often shockingly brash jolie as gibsons assassin mentor is controlled and calculated like a mechanical goddess she appears to gibson when he looks away for a second and for a while it seems like he might be imagining her as a way out of his doldrums once she gets a few good punches in on him during training though it becomes clear that she is definitely there to wake him up but his scars are most certainly not imaginedis about wanting something from life from yourself it is about not giving in to the conformist existence so many of us fall into and choosing to walk a different path a more exciting path now i dont think its encouraging everyone to leave their desk jobs and kill people professionally that has to run in your family remember there is no mistake though that bekmanbetov wants to wake you up in fact he gets a little aggressive on the subject in the films final scenes this is the only thing that irked me about the entire experience i had already a blast the whole time that the energy itself was enough to get my blood boiling over the monotony of my weekday life up until then it seemed as though he had sympathy for gibson and the millions of us out there just like gibson but then all of a sudden he was pointing the finger directly at me and calling me a loser to my face still maybe getting everyone angry is the only way to get anyone to actually do something about it,fantasy
although not a ground breaking film by any means is a fun  fastpaced thrill ride packed with humor and violence  if you can get past the hefty helping of camerashake and fbombs that isjames mcavoy makes the part his own i was stunned to learn that he also played mr tumnus in chronicles of narnia talk about range lol hes fun to watch and has great timing and presencejolie steals the stage with her trademark smirk phenomenal looks and badgirl persona she and mcavoy pair well on screenweighing in is morgan freeman this film probably wont win him any awards but his charm and strength plays well and anchors the filmthe movie was edited well the scenes flowed easily and breaks in the momentum were purposeful and not drawn out a major plus has going for it is that it doesnt take itself too seriously youll be switching from laughter to saying whoa check that outi dont know how well this will stand up to this years lineup but on its own merits its definitely worth a little coin and a friday evening to check out if you like action a plot twist or two some good humor and smart writing then definitely go see ps definitely not meant for younger viewers,fantasy
with action and suspense elements comparable to but still slightly lower quality than the matrix and the bourne movies brings a lot to the screen the action sequences are phenomenal and with james mcavoy angelina jolie and morgan freeman as principals there is plenty of star power mcavoys change from patsy to hero is inspiring jolie is beautiful tough and sexy as usual freemans wise old man persona carries his usual weight despite the intensity the film did seem to drag occasionally and the patsy angle seems slightly overplayed still the story was compelling and held my interest through to the end some of the effects are truly spectacular and cutting edge if you like action movies you will want to see this one,fantasy
i saw at a sneak preview first let me say that i went expecting to hate it nothing i saw about this movie in trailers or commercials made me want to see it i was wrong this movie blew my socks off i dont go to movies just to watch stuff blow up i need more something deeper something with thought and creativity delivers all of that and more our hero wesley is reluctantly trained to be an assassin dont worry im not going to spoil anything this is not news i was reminded of rocky with the training scenes only wesley is the side of beef ill not say any more the movie has twists and turns and mind numbing action and a little bit of heart keep in mind this is based on a graphic novel so stretching reality is okay angelina jolie while i get tired of her holding orphans and wanting to feed the world she is incredibly beautiful and she uses it like a weapon in although she could stand to stop feeding the world and eat a sammich dont take the kiddies to this one i sat next to a family with little kids and the mother had to rush and cover the kids eyes when suddenly sex is thrust in their eyes not once but twice then f bombs flying everywhere not to mention the gore theres plenty of that what i expected to be a 1  movie turns out to be a 3  movie butter up the popcorn and buckle up its going to be a fun ride,fantasy
is the most satisfying action movie i have seen in quite some time kudos to universal for taking a risk in hiring a genuinely distinctive and singular talent in timur bekmambetov director of the excellent night watch and its sequel day watch they have also taken a risk in allowing this to be rrated they havent wimped out for the sake of a few bucks like other studios im looking at you die hard 4 instead they have made a foulmouthed ultraviolent hugely exciting action thriller sure its plot is offthewall and completely ridiculous but just sit back and enjoy the glorious visuals extraordinary acting sequences and the stellar cast in particular mcavoy,fantasy
satisfying very good action flick with great special effects angelina is as usual bad ass and james mcavoy proved himself worthy of winning the role as wesley gibson with twists and turns the movie doesnt seem to last the whole two hours of its running timei definitely left with a smile on my face lets just say that if youre craving a good action flick definitely see obviously this movie isnt for children otherwise it wouldnt be rated r its a little gory and definitely not for the weak stomach is definitely worth the ticket price and im buying the dvd immediately when it comes out,fantasy
the latest offering from the russian director of nightwatch is an exhilarating effectsladen romp that offers topnotch action but clearly does not take itself too seriously the plot centers on an undistinguished office drone wesley james mcavoy who is inducted by fox angelina jolie into a secret brotherhood of assassins initially it seems that he was chosen to follow in the footsteps of the father he never knew but of course things are not quite what they seemthere is no shortage of high velocity mayhem involving curving slowmo bullets and spectacular vehicular acrobatics particular kudos must go to an early scene involving a dodge viper in addition the script is smarter and funnier than what is usual for this type of film the strong cast which also includes terence stamp and morgan freeman acquit themselves well and ms jolie looks utterly divine as always all in all this is an awesome popcorn movie that works extremely hard to entertain its audience and though violent has a very hard time pulling its tongue out of its cheek definitely big summer fun,fantasy
every once in a while a movie comes along which breaks every rule set down by decades of films before it every era has at least one and ever since the matrix came along with its seamless integration of psychedelic cg incredible imagination and jumbled direction that always leaves you slightly perplexed but wanting more an experience only slightly hindered in my own opinion by keanu reeves acting weve been living in the era in which action movies strive to follow in its footsteps even to the point of casting keanu reeves god knows why now has come along that beaten path and the rules have been broken againif i were to describe as a rigid film connoisseur i would probably have to give this movie a 410 a movie with barely any plot direction character development closure with predictable twists and uninteresting situations etc a movie which breaks not only every film law in the book but also the fundamental laws of physics gravity reality biology etc etc etchowever i cannot give this movie anything but a 9 because was nothing short of an astounding and awesome and i do mean awesome action flick i could watch every day for the rest of my life and i doubt i would ever get bored with it the numbness inflicted when i watched the ending sequence left me in a state of awe and wonderment i have yet to recover from the only thing preventing me from giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is far from perfectas ive already mentioned the story is somehow both simplistic and convoluted wesley  the protagonist is as shallow as the rest of the cast of characters and is occasionally annoying with his overuse of words and phrases which thankfully deviate from most classic oneliners the direction zig zags all over the place and you could see every plot twist coming from a mile away if you were paying any attention to the plot that is but i found myself forgetting all of this because of how awesome everything else wasand if you can go into a theatre watch this movie and see nothing but the problems in the above paragraph believe me when i say that you are missing out on the cinematic experience of a lifetimeagain this is an era in which cg can determine the quality of an action movie and could never have existed without the effects it uses and while this frequently this makes movies insubstantial and weak its far from true in this case this movie blew my mind and if you can set your disbelief aside for two hours to watch it it will probably it will do the same for you,fantasy
some you may be puzzled by the preceding statement so ill explainthe graphic novel miniseries took place in a world where thinlydisguised pastiches of dc comics supervillains had finally achieved victorythe hit man movie had a bald assassin raised and trained by some ageold secret society going rogue when he learned that he had been framed for an assassination that he technically never committed sort of like lee harvey oswaldjames macavoy as wesley gibson plays essentially the same character with the only differences being that he initially has a deadend job hes not bald and angelina jolie plays his personal trainerboom chicka wowwowin addition to all that morgan freeman plays mr sloan the same way he played keanu reeves boss in chain reaction that political thriller about cold fusion smoother than the skin of a snake and just as dangerous to get too close to while the snake is still in itspeaking of keanu reeves the scenes that simulate the enhanced physical prowess of the fraternitys assassins are reminiscent of the vr training sessions between keanu and samuel l jackson in the matrix trilogy which is why i cant give this movie a perfect tentheyre a little too similar for my comfort almost to the point of ruining the moviei do like the underlying questions asked by the film though how much of what happens in our lives is predestination and how much is the result of our own actionsinactions or to put it in even simpler terms as a result of the trainwreck scene if its okay to kill one person to save thousands does that make it equally okay to kill dozens just to get one,fantasy
its a lot of fun and thats really all it aims to be james mcavoy basically proves that he can do anything as the young pale scottish boy turns himself into a believable action star angelina jolie is painfully sexy and perfectly emotionless my only real complaint is that sometimes it feels like it tries way too hard to be different sometimes that works and sometimes it doesnt but the majority of the stuff falls into the former camp so there isnt a lot to complain about the dialogue is a little silly at times and some of the action fringes on being almost too ridiculous but overall its really just a lot of adrenalinefueled fun,fantasy
greetings again from the darkness combine sin city and the bourne series toss in some humor and add a significant amount of violence and action and you get director timur bekmambetovs film version of mark millars comic booksuspension of belief is a requirement for enjoying this movie but if you can do that it is actually a good bit of fun james mcavoy in his first action hero role while angelina jolie is utilized to perfection by that i mean she smirks a lot and prowls around like a panther flashing that very unique face and body of hers think of her in gone in 60 seconds and mr and mrs smith  not a lot of dialogue but plenty of fast action mcavoy proves to be a good mix of ultimate slacker in the beginning and transformed assassin by the mid pointthe basis of the story is actually very creative mcavoy is the lone offspring of the worlds deadliest assassin but he is stuck in a office cubicle being bullied by his fat female boss at work and humiliated by his notimpressed girlfriend at home the rest of the film features him trying to find out who he really is well actually he spends the rest of the film learning to unleash the assassin buried inside the action scenes are stellar and push the envelope the opening sequence featuring david ohare the departed is one of the coolest scenes you will find also impressive is the longest train wreck ever presented on film lending a hand in all of this is morgan freeman as the leader of the fraternity rapper common as an assassin terence stamp in a brief but crucial role and the underappreciated thomas kretschmann king kong u571 as the rogue assassin everyone is out to kill all of this is capped off with an excellent danny elfman score and some nine inch nails headbanging,fantasy
is a fun and exciting action adventure film centered on the world of secret assassins dont expect a deep plot with mind provoking twists is an action movie with some unique cinematography and newer action styles to give a wild ride great cast and one of my favorite james mcavoy movies if you have are looking for a mindless action movie that delivers the gun battles and matrix style action scenes then this movie is right up your alley,fantasy
fun movie with a lot of action be ready for a loy of fiction but entertaining movie,fantasy
let me start by saying that this film is a blast i originally to see this in theaters but the money was tight so i had to wait for dvd i first saw this on my buddys copy on dvd he and i and another friend of mine really liked iti found it original and fresh you didnt essentially know where it was going and that was good and it always surprised you in unique and interesting waysthe action scenes were awesome and fun to watch and it had a well made well paced story that was easy to followjames mcavoy is a very good actor and a great lead in this film he is good in the latter xmen films and a joy to watchmorgan freeman was awesome as sloan leader of the organization of assassinsangelina jolie was awesome as fox she was sexy a little edgy and fun to watchoverall a really cool action film that i enjoyed i give it a 610 i highly recommend it,fantasy
i cant believe i waited 7 years to watch something fantastically brilliant james mcavoy plays wesley a man who who had a very ordinary life until he found out that he was an assassin with unlimited powers which allowed him to slow down time this bullet bending thriller is an absolute popcorn action flick its the way a modern action movie should be in the end it turns out that he is one of the most list created by the fraternity leader sloan morgan freeman and he is out to kill all the members including wesley i especially love the slow motion because it really adds to the action my favourite bit is when wesley deploys a thousand rats into the fraternity building and all the rats have bombs attached to them if you want to watch this film get your popcorn ready its going to be an excellent joy filled ride 910 pure excellence,fantasy
is a great movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding castthe movie is action packed and very intense from start to finishthe story and the characters are very unique and not quite like any action movie ive seen previouslyi loved the slow motion shots that are used quite regularly throughout the movie and is the best example that it is also directed in a very unique wayjames mcavoy does a great job in the lead rolei didnt think it would be easy to keep the audience interested in your character especially when angelina jolie and morgan freeman are in supporting rolesbut he is genuinely that good of an actor that he was interesting enough to keep my attentionaction packed and very enjoyablei would recommend to anyone looking for a good crime or action film a man survives an assassination attempt only to discover hes destined to join a band of mystical killersbest performance james mcavoy worst perfornance lorna scott,fantasy
in 2008s james mcavoy plays an anxious computer jockey taken advantage of by all who know him who discovers not only that his longlost dad has been murdered and that said dad was actually an elite assassin but also that he himself has superspy skills and must be trained to harness them and one of his fellow assassins is angelina jolie so its basically a fantasy aimed at shlubby white malesmcavoys wesley is an office drone who takes medication for his anxiety and is bullied by his abusive staplerclicking boss and whose buddy played by chris pratt has been boinking wesleys harpy girlfriend he lives in an apartment alongside an elevated railroad his life sucks so you can imaging his surprise when hes confronted by a mysterious woman named fox jolie while getting his prescription filled a man has tracked him to the drugstore she purrs and hes about to kill you a shootout ensues fox and wesley escape and hes brought to a textile factory to meet the suave mr sloan who gives wesley the lowdown on his origins every hero needs one and gives him a motive  to find and assassinate the man who murdered his fatherbut before that can happen we must endure a training montage wesley learns how to fight with knives  and gets plenty of slices of his own wesley learns how to take a punch while being tied to a chair wesley learns how to fire a gun so that the bullet curves around obstacles you know standardissue stuff and then hes ready wait no hes not sloan makes him do some killin missions you know to keep up appearances with the other assassins the basic idea is that the looms in the textile factory contain coded messages that when decoded provide the name of the assassin groups next targetthe story is based on a comic book or graphic novel whichever is appropriate so suspension of disbelief is paramount take the idea behind curving bullets or that wesley can suddenly get ripped and become great at handtohand fighting or that theres a magical soaking tub that heals everything from scratches to broken bones gotta just buy into it fail to do so at your own peril is what im getting at hereanyway i liked the movie a lot of exhilarating action and then theres jolie hardly says a word for the first hour of the movie easy work if you can get it come to think of it she doesnt say much in the movie and im betting a stunt double helped in some of the action scenes now thats a good career choicewas as outlandishly high energy as one might expect so id recommend it for action movie fans or comicbook fans and especially jolie fans,fantasy
reading the other reviews it seems that i am one of the few people who really liked this film its catered to a very specific taste and is taken to the extreme and the result of that is you either love it or you hate itpersonally i love it while the scenes of bulletbending and slowmo madness are so cool and overthetop that they make your eyes bleed it was the story of wesley gibson that really sold it for me hes just an average joe with an average job and then out of the blue he learns hes really an assassin destined for greater things than sitting in a cubicle after some brutal training he goes on to kick some serious butt with morgan freeman and angelina joliei think why i find this movie so thoroughly enjoyable though is the idea that wesley could be any of us anyone who has ever been frustrated or bored with their life has probably fantasized one time or another about being a part of something greater and thats what makes appealingi wouldnt go so far as to say this is a scholarly or even particularly good movie but it sure is an enjoyable one the trick is just to take it for what it is an action flick about a nobody becoming a somebody with lots and lots of guns,fantasy
is just another action movie out there to entertain the summer audiences there are some new elements added to this film but most of it is what we would expect and thats a good thing there are also some matrix elements that were incorporated into this filmthis movie is about a guy named wesley who finds out that he is the son of a superassassin now wesley has to follow in his own fathers footstepsthe acting is good i felt like james mcavoys character is a bit of a dweeb though angelina jolie is very goodlooking as always its also nice to see morgan freeman play the villain you dont see that too muchoverall this is a solid action film with tons of action great sets and just a good old time i rate this film 810,fantasy
is very creative in its thought and raw in its expression that even now it still holds up to be one of the best action films i have yet to see its one of those films that contain the perfect idea with a unique set of characters and just the right amount of forethought to keep the storyline and action practically timeless timurs undeniable respect for the action film and its design to just take it a step further without being grossly overwhelming was in my opinion perfect action films for the most part rely on the over the top scenario and the almost impossible task of the hero to overcome his or her circumstances embraced this formula keeping its hero wesley likable and real by placing him in an environment that made us appreciate how cool this would be and giving us a world where the violence is almost welcoming and keeping us for the moment uncaring whether this could happen or not but just loving the fact that we it to be and i did,fantasy
the weak point of this movie is the absurdity of the story itself its so unreal that the film could never catch me into it of course that my preferences have a huge importance in this affirmation and i am not a fan of this kind of comicsalthough the story wasnt engaging at all the film has a great cast and the interpretations are very goodwith a story so unreal the film is watchable due to its nice action scenes  its really great in special effects i give it a 6 out of 10 positive  saved by cinematography action scenes and interpretations negative  a totally unreal story but it may be good for fiction comics fans,fantasy
2008 is one of those flicks that knows what its aboutunabashed unadulterated unapologetic fun the plot and story are thin thin thin but so what the movie is told with confidence flair and style and never lets up infusing elements of the matrix as well as action sequences reminiscent of scenes from mission impossible the train scene the karate kid training scenes and commando the kick ass finale stars upandcoming superstar james mcavoy from atonement and the last king of scotland a young brit with loads of talent and ability and he gets to get the action genre out of the way early in his career mcavoy supplies the flick with muchneeded humor he is selfdeprecating as he is a rather slight man but at the same time convinces when he becomes a true badassmcavoy is supported by none other than megastars morgan freeman and angelina jolie who act as mcavoys mentors freeman while adding dignity and weight to the proceedings manages never to come across as pretentious as he sometimes does in films and plays his role just with tongueincheek appeal reminiscent of the mentors in the kill bill movies actually im not a huge fan of jolie at all but her overthetop sex appeal is toned down just enough in this to make her sensual but convincing as a deadly assassin and her odd chemistry with mcavoy is fun to watch but mcavoy is the main draw in this flick a refreshing newcomer that keeps you rooting for his character to the very endstarts off with a literal matrixlike bang as a mysterious assassin nailed by david ohara performs his latest hit then after a series of thrilling sequences is killed then we are introduced to wesley mcavoy a nebbishy office cog wesley has a verbally abusive boss the bombastic janice scenestealing lorna scott a brainless bimboish selfinvolved girlfriend hilarious kristin hager and a jerkish best friend funny chris pratt and he has constant anxiety attacks of coursean attempt is made on his life at the drug store buying his supply of anxiety medication then hot female assassin fox jolie intervenes to save him wesley is destined to follow in his footsteps and become a world class assassin so says foxs employer sloan freeman after a lot of pleading and plodding sloan convinces wesley to face his destiny head on and fox and sloans other assassins including rapper common who is quite convincing in a small role train himthe scenes of wesleys training are slick and stylish with great special effects and stuntwork freeman and jolies cold professional seriousness is a great counterpoint to mcavoys comical light take on everything the 2 opposing styles clash to make a totally enjoyable moviegoing experience its almost like they will him to become a badass which is kind of what happens the action scenes are overthetop but entertaining as all get out and done in a fun fastpaced way where i couldnt help but be drawn in the ending scene is as exciting as the come with a perfect musical accompaniment that makes it worth it,fantasy
i have to say that i never followed any comic book synopsis before going to see this i knew nothing about the picture other than angelina jolie was in it and it was an action film though it apparently pulled from various past films as most do ie edward nortons in fight clubkeanu reeves in matrix in combination with the obvious visual effects stunt of bending the bullets which was an obvious rip off concept from the matrix or so i believe the film succeeded overall and was thoroughly entertaining main point of interest was the rating too many films these days have quality storyline and visual content that is sacrificed by child friendly ratings mind you ratings have become more relaxed over the past few years the r rating allowed for just the right amount of gore missing from the matrix to satisfy my appetite very pleased,fantasy
wesley gibson is a loser we watch him at work where his bossy supervisor janice loves to make threatening demands at wesley because he is not performing one day wesley meets a mysterious woman fox who will change his life forever fox is a member of the highly skilled group of assassins that called themselves the fraternity these people have been operating since ancient times now they want to get wesley into their fold because unknown to him he has a history with the organizationthe fraternity will train him in all aspects of their deathly trade the organization led by sloan has a way for reading secret messages that are encoded to old woven fabrics whenever the time arises one of the members will be sent to get rid of that enemy by whatever means wesley is finally sent to do his first big assignment in europe but there is a big surprise when he finds out who is this person he has been sent to killtimur bekmambetov who has made a name for himself in action films is in charge to bring this comic book adventure as a big spectacle for his adoring fans based on the stories by mark millar and jg jones and adapted for the screen by michael brandt and derek haas this is an almost allspecialeffects movie david brenner the editor was probably a busy man during the post production of because of all the intricate stunts the director favoredborrows liberally from other better made movies a lot of them come to mind but we are not going to talk here about them best thing in the film is the cool appearance of a tattooed angelina jolie who is the woman in charge of training wesley and who takes him under her wing james mcevoy has some good moments as well morgan freeman is the head of the group doing a role he probably knows by heart nowto say the plot is implausible at best would be giving the film makers more credit than they are due we loved the restorative bath where wesley recuperates from his wounds was it wax wed love to have one of those right now best advice for anyone that wants to see this movie is to just go for the ride and have a nice ride not recommended for the feinthearted though,fantasy
i really enjoyed this film it has its own fantasy and own life and if you follow it just go with it not really knowing where it will take you how true it will be how filled with fantasy or other worldliness  well just enjoy itenjoy the special effects enjoy the fullness of a production that really is quite fascinating in the world of film making not the greatest film but well worth watching especially in our life of revealing secrets of illuminati and conspiracy theories mixing magic with reality fact or fiction where science fiction is now science reality  sit back and enjoy the filmthis is not my usual genre of film that i enjoy but i have to say  the cast is solid the story even more so and yes the cinematography and effects  great enjoy,fantasy
ill start with we all like different kind of movies but the thing that pisses me off is how you expect that every movie ever made has to be some true ultraintelligent story that inspires some profound thoughts and sht as difficult as it may be for you you have to except the fact that there are some movies made for the simple pleasure of watching high speed races with beautiful cars and guns being fired in the background yes it is a nice thing to see a good movie that will make you think about something important a movie thats not just some silly story but cant all of them be like that take a break take a beer watch a movie relax cant relax to a movie about the meaning of life  though i dont see how an action movie can be about the meaning of life but thats beside the pointand the point being  stop bitching about how unrealistic the movie is and just enjoyplease do me a favor and go to youtube then search for if movies were real d,fantasy
so james mcavoy plays a bored office worker whose being chased by this killer and saved by angelina jolies character to be hired by a group of assassins who maintain the balance of order in the world by a magic weaving machine i kid you not they can make bullets bend and have the ability to perform superhuman feats but seemingly without superhuman abilities and it is all a big excuse to use yet more matrixy effects bit without the reasoning logic or sensethis film is a terrible indictment of some of the summer dross we have been getting over recent years and sadly because people dont know how to rate action movies they just heap praise on stuff without thinking of whether it is worthy of that praise and this was one of those filmsthe matrix has rules and an ideology central to the story to mean that the effects are essential to the story in too many films at the moment the story seems to be a reason to put certain effects scenes together and jeez they are poor no emotional involvement did i ever feel for the characters even when the magic weave machine gave out their names and put them in jeopardy one of the things there should always be in any action film is a sense of danger and their never was here it is just a collection of well constructed sequences with little emotional resonance in betweenthis is tedious fare indeed and its sad that its managed to get a rating this high when so much better films barely get over ninenuff said,fantasy
is a guilty pleasure for me its amoral rather superficial but so much fun and stylish with a good plot a few big surprises and really thrilling action scenes theres stuff in this film that ive never seen anywhere else i found it bold dynamic and original keep in mind that im not judging it based on the comic books source material i understand the two are quite different and i might have been miffed at the liberties taken if i had read them regarding the plot the only thing i really have some issue with would be a special loom but i got beyond it is a great action movie with some fantastical elements that enhance the wow factor just dont take it too seriously or think too much about all the victims of the collateral damage oh what the heck since i was so enthusiastic after seeing it for the first time which rarely happens im going to give it another half star its worth purchasing as its very spectacular and rewatchablerating 85 out of 10ps since this original review i read the graphic novel that inspired the movie adaptation the graphic novel and the the movie are two completely different beasts that are extremely loosely connected ive rarely seen such drastic changes in terms of story characters and settings heck practically everything purists of the graphic novel will be sorely disappointed unless they can view the movie as a separate entity,fantasy
its the curving bullets that stay in the memory the longest thats not too much of a recommendation this is about a shy office boy who wonders if his life will ever go anywhere then someone shoots at him he is saved by angelina jolie and finds life becomes more exciting than he ever when he is hired into a league of assassinsthese assassins are supposed to be highly moral only executing those who are guilty of crimes pretty good premise for a film but how do you take the loom of doom thank you dr mark kermode seriouslyenough work went into this script to make it worthwhile however theres a couple of clever plot twists which keeps this interesting whos good and whos bad the plot ideas centre onthe cast is also unexpectedly starry morgan freeman and a largely reticent angelina jolie make this stand out from similar action movies,fantasy
this movie is probably one of the worst ive seen in a while i realize the movie is based on a comic but the plot is still ridiculous it seemed they were just throwing new things into the movie every few minutes and that all it took was for morgan freeman to say it and wed accept it perfect example the looms the entire movie is focused on being assassins and whatnot and then out of nowhere albeit we see the looms as its a textile plant assassins are told what to do by reading whats found in the fabricyeah i know its absurd im always willing to suspend disbelief but this just asked me to add new ridiculous things every 5 minutes we bend bullets theres an all healing bath we read our assignments through a misplaced thread that translates into binary predating computers the man trying to kill you is your dad hes not your dad morgan freeman cheated this code we have that gets little considerable mention throughout the film all in all its an action movie if youre drunk or bored or just easily impressed youll enjoy this if you like quality films stick to the matrix,fantasy
couldnt stand more than 20 minutes of this junkit seems to me that this is the story of a geeky looser that suddenly discovers he has superskills so far so good but instead of being a movie with a good drama and a nicely and well crafted background artful scenes like the materix for instance its seems to be nothing more than geek  super hero  kills evilness  the endthis movie really reminds me of jumper which also really suckedbad unrealistic action mixed with bad drama and rather poor humor it stinkscant give this more than a three,fantasy
look i know that most big summer blockbusters go light on the plot and heavy on the slick special effects but didnt really have either every review i read raves about the action sequences but id seen it all before seemingly the only special effect that they use over and over is the curving bullets thing where our assassins can someone get bullets to travel in arcs instead of straight lines when this happens the camera artfully pans around a cgi bullet as it slices through the air in slow motion how revolutionary i mean the only other time ive seen a camera pan around an object frozen in time was in the matrixand every movie video game tv show and commercial made since the matrix came out a fcking decade ago and as for the plot i wont drop any spoilers but if you have more than three functioning brain cells youll start seeing obvious plot holes about 20 minutes in and continue to see them right up to the films unsatisfying conclusion i dont like to be the the book was better guy but in this case ill make an exception you can tell that the screenwriter read up to about page 30 then decided that a secret society of assassins with the most useless super power imaginable would be a lot better than an actionpacked yet highly introspective look at the corruptibility of man the nature of freedom and what happens if the bad guys actually win,fantasy
i only saw about 10 seconds of the film and that was too much already it was on tv i jumped in when the young apprentice was practicing shooting the target that was behind the head of his colleague angelina jolie and like that was not enough waving the gun while doing it just for a good measure anyone with a basic police or military training will tell you that shooting your colleague in the head is not a good idea for target practice i honestly believe that such kind of stupidity has done lot of damage to the brains of the young population more than sex scenes kids will have to learn about sex one way or another eventually if we want to have somebody to inherit our world after all but this is just plain wrong to throw all human logic through the window and replace it with coolness,fantasy
this is an example where if the makers tried to make the typical action film then this would have been quite good fun a young guy finds out he is part of a league of assassins and tries to hunt down the man responsible for his fathers death had they made an action film about that then it would have been good but the director to be different and the result is a poorly made film with unlikable charactersi know that this is based off a graphic novel but there was a lot of potential here for example the ability to curve bullets the problem lies in that most of the action scenes involve the heroes fighting one enemy and that isnt interesting this limits the action considerably and the final action scene is just bad there is no tension since you dont care about anyone if like your action films filled with unlikeable characters lots of swearing breaking the forth wall that really annoyed me and cgi then you will like this filmthe visuals are really good though there is a action scene with a train which was the best thing about the film everything else just fell short james mcavoys character wesley is really unlikeable from the start you never like him once throughout the film and that will stop a lot of people from enjoyingrent this film if you are interested in seeing it or if you have read the graphic novel otherwise unless you are interested if hearing the cool sound effects you may want to miss this,fantasy
the movie starts out with anticipating action the action you just knew the movie would have with its breath taking special effects could not get any better than thiswesley gibsonjames mcavoy is a accounting manager with a anorexic boss that makes wesleys everyday life miserable wesley seems to not care about anything these days his dad took off when he was seven days old then found out that his dad was a professional assassin greatest ever to live and got murdered at the metropolitan buildingfoxangelina jolie trains wesley to get revengefor his fathers murder in his training he has to accomplish different tasks many of the tasks are impossible unless wesley choose his fate to challenge the impossiblesloanmorgan freeman is in command of fraternity the fraternity describe themselves as weapons of fate they are assassins with purpose to maintain stability in a unstable world to kill one save a thousandwesley is finally is prepared for his enemy and isnt going to show any mercy watch to unfold secrets that you never would of thought the movie gets your adrenaline going and at the end its gonna make you wanting moreif you watched this movie or about to watch it keep in mind there making a sequelahaynes,fantasy
is like the new type of actionfilm it knows its silly it knows its over the top and because of that it is an extremely fun and entertaining film i had so much fun with this movie the main characters are very fleshed out so we can relate to them and care for them the performances are all very good notably james mcavoy proves he is an amazing actor capable of a lot of things his performance here is really different than the rest of his films but his performance is pitchperfect i have to say and went along with the film greatly angelina jolie is great in this role as is morgan freeman the acting and writing are done purposely comedic and silly but by no means in a bad way both the script and acting are very very good for an action film now to the amazing action sequences this if the most fun i have had watching a film in like the last few years and i mean that with a big smile the action pieces are amazing the curving bullets the overthetop car scenes the gore and the violence just wow i have not seen a film this overthetop and unrealistic in a very very long time i mean that as a big compliment why have an action film that wants to be realistic even though they almost never are here you can play so many tricks with what is happening on screen so much fun director timur bekmambetov is very talented his direction was superb and very stylish and in control the visual and sound effects are amazing as proved since it got two oscar nominations for the sound the slow motion is cleverly used not like it was done so often in 300 but here it works a lot betterat the end of the day yes is just an action film but boy i had not seen an action film be able to captivate me the way this one did it has mindblowing action sequences awesome energy and so stylishly done effects not to mention the characters are very leveled out and it is a film that really hits us on an emotional level with all of its twists and turns moviegoing at its best i am sure a lot of people do hate it but honestly i could not care less to me is the most actionpacked film of the decade and perhaps the best as well,fantasy
after shooting someone in the head our hero announces this is me taking back control of my life what the fk have you done latelyahm im sorrythis was supposed to be just a bit of saturday afternoon popcorn munching action so i wasnt expecting great character development just some cgiladen film aimed at teens who spend most of their time playing video gamesbut thena dead old lady on a meat hook is used for target practice were told that using real bodies is a better way to train oh okaya guy is responsible for a train wreck in which hundreds of innocent people are killed but they clearly dont matter we stay focused on the main character hes clearly more important than themthese kind of stories are what you get in an alienated narcissistic society or at least an alienated narcissistic writerdirector none of the characters get close enough to one another to actually care so the lives of others never seem to matterlife is a black and white choice between being a weak powerless pussy or becoming a hard brutal killer trust no one no grey areas thereand the shocking last line of the film is a nail in the coffinunless this is meant to be the blackest of comedies the message appears to be  if you cant find any meaning in your life go out and shoot someoneeven angelina jolies smirk cant save this one,fantasy
this is an insult to brain reason cinematography and humanity nothing this stupid can ever be made again nor has been made this is a crime against humanity stupidity at its sincerest meaningless best my brain was dead for two days from the sheer retardation of this movie extra retard points go to jolie for having the one blank stupid expression throughout the whole crap proving herself yet again as a cheap slut and a worthless talentless trailertrash queen horrible freeman is mindnumbing in fact all of acting is halfasleep boring a pure clich with predictable lobotomizing lines predictable plot cheap cartoonlike animation effects and insultingly stupid ideas about curving bullets and action in general the only possible purpose of this pile of stinking crap is to induce vomit in anyone with a brain,fantasy
before seeing on dvd i though well this might not be a good movie boy was i wrong was a pretty cool movie and the action sequences were shot in slow motion so that you can actually see every detail of gore in the kills if you are looking for hard r material pedal to the medal action then has itis about a man named wesley gibson james mcavoy whos life has gone down the toilet he has a mean boss his girlfriend is sleeping with his best friend and he swallows pills like candy then fox angelina jolie meets wesley gibson at a store and invites wesley to come join her and sloan morgan freeman to the fraternity which was where a league of assassins would work his father was also the greatest assassins who ever livednow does start out a little slow but thats okay because after the first 10 or 15 minutes its nonstop fast paced action after that in the middle of the movie it actually gets better and by the time the movies done it turned out great a lot of people are hating on was because of the ending so what every ending has to be good another thing they say it takes itself too seriously its just a movie what were they expecting the dark knight or something give me a breakevery action sequence in is shot very unique for example in one scene wesley someone with a keyboard and the letters spell out fu every single time someone shoots by curving the bullet the sometimes have names on the bullet like goodbye i thought that was really cool just how they take the action sequences in slow motion was just amazing overall i think is a cool action movie that is kickbutt from start to finish it delivers everything a fan could want you see a bare back shot of angelina jolie with her tattoos morgan freeman drops f bombs which never happens and very cool action sequences,fantasy
this movie is frankly terrible and this is from a guy who enjoys uwe boll if hes drunk enough the bulletbending thing is about the only original bit of action most of the action scenes rip off better action movies with the matrix and equilibrium being the most notable but it hardly stops there and instead of enjoying them for the cheese they are i just want to watch the better movies theyre ripping offthe characters though are the worst part the protagonist in particular wesley is the most unsympathetic character i believe ive ever seen in a film bar none i had more pathos for hitler in der untergang than i did for this guy for 999 of the movie he is an absolute sociopath lashing out violently at a world he thinks has wronged him when in fact his own behavior was the problem to begin with also angelina jolie gives her usual sterling performancei swear they couldve replaced her with a rock and you couldnt tell the difference except maybe the rock wouldnt look like a meth addictthere are three good things about this movie one the russian guy from night watch is in it and thats pretty cool even if he doesnt have much of a role two morgan freeman says the fword twice its kind of like hearing your kindly old grandfather curse for the first time in your life both horrifying and hilarious yes i have to scrape that low in the barrel and third this movie eventually ends leaving you to weep for the two hours of your life you will never ever have backgod help us all if they make a sequel,fantasy
i am good at letting things go in movies i mean if you go to a movie that wants to make you believe that a speeding bullet can be bent midflight you pretty much know you are going to have to give some creative allowances to that movie i found however that i had to give up way too many allowances for this particular movie what if nobody ever told you that bullets went straight the antagonist says i am guessing the same thing that would happen if nobody ever told me how awful this movie was it would still be awful i dont mean to be harsh but no amount of bending could help this movie hit its target are we really supposed to believe that this master assassin in an attempt to enact revenge on someone who tricked him into killing his own father spent a whole night affixing wrist watches onto 1000 rats i guess we should believe anything in this movie though since it wants us to believe a father could not call or email his son to let him know hey sorry have not been around but i need to warn you i just quit a cult and they may come knocking on your door now so why dont we meet for tea catch up on old times and i teach you how to say no to killer sects i think if someone in production could have actually read some strips of cloth then they would have seen this movies name come up and could have killed it before it affected so many others ,fantasy
ive read some of the comments and many of them are way off anybody giving this lower then a 610 just doesnt know a good action movie opens with an intense 20mins that keeps you literally on the edge of your seat with the great action sequence and car chase then we are treated to the plot for the next 40mins where wesley undergoes training from fox angelina jolie it was quite interesting seeing how they trained him because most action movies dont give a good back story at how the action hero became what he is now that was a smart idea from the director to show what the life of wesely was like before and after he transformed everyone knows that some scenes are impossible but does that stop a movie from being a good time and something to entertain you no was a fast paced thrill ride with 2 of the biggest twist ive seen in a movie in a long time this is better then the matrix sorry but it was written with a smart script and added with top notch acting some of the lines in this movie were made to add some humor and it did excellent movie excellent plot top notch twist youll never see coming and superb acting and action sequences galore,fantasy
first of alli hate people bitching about that wasnt realistic etc most of the time these people loved the matrix and science fiction movies like star wars and so onnope it wasnt realistic so what i thought it was a great movie ive seen all the movies out there and this one blew me away it has been a long time ago ive seen such a movie shooting jumping racing angelina jolie looking hot p  every time i was likewhooaaw thats fcking awesome and the movie was never getting boring and kept me waiting for the next insane thing to happen i liked this movie even better than the matrix if you like really good action moviesand you dont give a beep about if the moving is realistic or not you should see itbest movie of last year,fantasy
in some sense this movie was another son seeks revenge on person who killed his father storyline but it added a few more angles to keep it interestingalthough im not a fan of angelina jolie and her giant lips she did well by not speaking too much and just acting surly the rest of the cast werent that interesting and even morgan freeman as the bad guy didnt play well none of the actors had to stretch too much as the dialog was fairly minimal which in this case helped rather than hindered the back story was interesting albeit it made you ask the question who watches the watchmen the main saving grace was the cgi and plot twist at the end being a lover of all things gory and violent even i thought a good deal of the bloodshed was gratuitous and a bit unnecessary,fantasy
well this is another classic example of a screenplay with potential that was ruined by a director that wants nothing more but to make formula films for american teenagers the only positive piece of work that the director may have contributed was the subtle leftwing propaganda that placed into certain parts of the film aside from this the film did a good job in disgracing the great actor that is morgan freeman making angelina jolie look even less serious than she was taken before especially when they had to milk her death when it really was only necessary because of her alist star status and taking away most of the quality actor credibility that john macovoy had built up with atonement this film had a chance to get a point across but instead it was buried under hollywoods need to make money by using sex and violence to draw out the younger demographics of the us today such a disappointment i cant convey my disappointment in the film industry when they make mockeries like this,fantasy
if youre looking for a good summer block buster type movie to watch this isnt a bad place to start for 2008s season the movie never takes itself too seriously but is more of an actionthriller than a comedy it sort of reminds me of the matrix injected with heavy elements of fight club and office space if that makes any sense the action sequences are amazingly directed the cast works and most of the jokes are funny it speaks volumes that this film was directed by the same guy that did night watch and day watch which are personal favorites keeps up with that level of intensity there are a few goofy awkward moments but overall the film keeps you on the edge of your seat,fantasy
the classic hollywood action movie such a tough genre to work in especially now a days in the 70s it was about gritty realism the 80s was about over the top shenanigans the 90s was the birth of cgi when talent still matterednow we have the likes of the matrix and the star wars prequels orgies of cgi that trying to force themselves upon the public as classics the action heroes of old were able to mow down swaths of enemies before riding off into the sunset kicking that snide smile to the audience where have the action heroes gone i dont know but this is a great action movie if you were looking for a treatise on the superhero mythos read the watchmen comic book or wait for the movie the action is ridiculous over the top gratuitous and completely enthralling i spent the entire movie with my jaw dropped to the floor and the best part it was completely unapologetic no weepy second acts about the mayhem being wreaked that definitely has its place in good cinema but not here its balls to the walls from start to finishthe action is a lot like the matrix but it does not make you feel like you have to read a dissertation on western philosophy to appreciate it go turn off your brain offway off and enjoy it for what it is,fantasy
is one of the most over the top films ive seen in a good long time there is no real logic to it but the director timur bekmambetor who did the day watch and night watch films never tries to take his movie seriously the characters dont either and seem to be enjoying themselves immensely so i decided i would watch this movie and not take it seriously either the three main stars james mcavoy morgan freeman and angelina jolie do well with their roles but it is mcavoy who really steals the show from the rest i enjoyed itwesley gibson mcavoy is an account manager at an office he is neurotic and allows his boss girlfriend and best friend to walk all over him his life changes however when he meets fox jolie and he soon discovers that he has superhuman abilities it isnt long before he is recruited as an assassin into the fraternity which is a secret society led by sloan freeman and has been around for 1000 years all the other people in this society have the same abilities as wesley and they use their abilities to make life better for normal people there are also a couple more surprises which i will not revealthis movie is nonstop action with some snappy dialogue especially from wesley the others have their time in the sun as well but like i said earlier mcavoy who has never starred in an action movie with such intensity shines the brightest the stunts are unbelievable and mostly cgi but they work well in a movie like this i was never bored and really loved the final scene at the end of the movieif you are stressed at work and have always to get even with coworkers that you dont like and know you never could watch and you will feel much better i must also insist that you do not take this movie seriously if you do you will most likely hate it have fun,fantasy

the movie itself is just as awesome as the trailers which persuaded me to watch it as soon as it was released to theaters the idea of the film to where there is an advanced group of humans who are assassins is a good selling point for the film but the combination of being able to curve bullets awesome shootouts and angelina jolie makes this film as good as it gets speaking of angelina she is still as sexy and as beautiful as before she took time off to start her family although james mcavoy and angelina who are the two starring actors seeming as a very odd and unlikely duo really had great chemistry with each other there were some parts in the film where the cgi was just not up to par although this is a very cool and ingenious film i think with the abundance of actioncgi infested films lately movies seem to get monotonous and forgettable,fantasy
every so often a movie comes along which is so utterly captivating that you are able to forgive any plot holes or mistakes that there may be is one of those films directed with excellent style and surprising assurance by russian director timur bekmambetov filled with perfect performances and jampacked with some of the most memorably superb action sequences of the last couple of years is one hell of an experiencewesley gibson james mcavoy leads an almost nonexistent life his girlfriend is cheating with his best friend behind his back and his boss frequently bullies him plus he continually has severe panic attacks however after an encounter with the slinky fox angelina jolie wesley discovers that they arent panic attacks in fact wesley has inherited near superhuman abilities from his father who has been murdered by a rogue assassin named cross thomas kretschmann in an attempt to avenge his fathers death wesley joins up with fox and a group of assassins known as the fraternity however things arent what they seem one of the chief assets of is that in brilliant scottish actor james mcavoy it has a solid and human centre mcavoys wesley gibson starts the story as a nervous wreck of a human being and ends it as possibly one of the coolest movie heroes of the year mcavoy sells wesleys transformation effortlessly creating a likable smart and ultimately heroic character who is easy to relate to and to root for plus mcavoy has a nearimpeccable american accent to boot what more could you want mcavoy also has great support as fox angelina jolie is pure dynamite not only is fox as sultry as her name might suggest but jolie also adds intriguing layers to the character which stop her from becoming your typical love interest her final scene is surprisingly powerful in how fox is willing to carry out her beliefs to the very end no matter what the cost adding his usual gravitas to proceedings morgan freeman is typically great as sloan the leader of the fraternity bringing an elderly zest to the role he also has one absolute humdinger of a line which is likely to shock anyone who is familiar with his work in smaller roles rap artist common is solid as a fellow assassin whilst british actor terrence stamp makes a welcome but short appearance in a crucial rolethe film is directed with a grand vision and spectacular artistry by timur bekmambetov bekmambetov does a fantastic job here bringing unbound creativity and magnificent care to his role in the films production there are some absolutely outstanding moments of pure visual power in this film take the films opening gunfight in which a man drives through a window before engaging in a midair gun battle this moment is potentially iconic and bekmambetov stages it with such perfect imagination and timing that it has a spike of adrenaline which separates it from similar scenes in other films matrix reloaded etc bekmambetov also stages the films other action sequences just as perfectly as well as this bekmambetov shows several moments of wit by using his visual style and is aided by a surprisingly smart and confident script speaking of action is one of the best films in that field for the past few years a marvellous extravaganza of a sequence which starts as a supermarket shootout between fox and cross thomas kretschmann is terrific and evolves into a noholdsbarred car chase is one of the most magnificently executed action sequences of this year and possibly more and is full of wonderful invention and humour later on in the film there is a sequence involving a train and a literal cliffhanger which has to be seen to be believed whilst the final showdown doesnt disappoint in terms of its mindblowing imagination and beautiful staging the crew behind this film notably bekmambetov most certainly know how to craft exhilarating action and they have managed to accomplish that by the bucketload herewhen everythings been said and done is one of the years mustsee movie events its premise alone is one worth investigating but without the unrestrained brilliance of timur bekmambetovs imagination james mcavoys exceptional lead performance a flawless supporting cast and absolutely majestic action sequences which are ablaze with life and creativity wouldnt be anywhere near the stunner of a thrillride which it has become it is already being touted as this years matrix and whilst i wouldnt totally agree with that statement the matrix in my opinion is a genrebending classic still stands out in the crowd as well as that the pitchperfect final scene complete with a killer final line left me thirsting for more,fantasy
the only interesting parts of this movie are in the trailer if youve seen the trailer then dont waste your time and money the plot of this film was by far the worst ive seen in years the acting wasnt bad however the writer should be beaten for even thinking this was a great idea the actors should fire their managers for even bringing this to them and then hide out long enough for everyone to forget this movie if you do decide to waste hours of your life make sure you leave the kids at home the language and random sex scene are not for even teenagers there were several parents who brought their kids to this movie there is a reason the movie is rated r,fantasy
ok to truly appreciate this film you have to forget all your usual action film rules clichs and the general dos and donts because literally throws this all out the windows picks it up again shakes it around and slowmotion shoots the rules right in the face and does whatever looks cool however this works in some weird way it manages to pull off all the overthetop action stunts and shooting because it looks amazing on screen and completely fits with the comic book style i left the cinema literally wanting to be an assassinapart from the spectacular action there is also so much humour which made me literally laugh out loud for example his hilarious boss foxs reactions to wesley and wesleys general nervous awkwardness when faced which such intimidating people james macavoy was perfect for this role you completely buy this character and you really want him to succeed people in the cinema were literally clapping when he smacks the keyboard across his friends face spelling the word fuck you in the air from flying keys the u being made up from a tooth angelina jolie was also painfully cool everyone gasped when she first appeared on screen her action scenes make her even more hotter as she effortlessly drives a car whilst laying on the bonnet shooting bad guys whilst dodging passing traffic and her chemistry with james was hilarious from start to finish morgan freeman is as usual fantastic only enhancing the quality of this filmthe story is generally gripping filled with twists and turns leaving you to wonder how it all will end out and the ending is certainly no let down allowing you to leave the cinema feeling completely satisfied and wanting more the quirkiness and absurdity of this film makes it completely different from all your other action films as it really is a real fun watch is definitely the best action film of the year and one of the most original ive seen for a long time,fantasy
i was shaking from excitementi was crying from excitementi was laughing from excitement and also from jokesi was hoping for more more and more these amazing action scenes to seei was all the time with my eyes opened and afraid to blink not to miss anythingi was in love with characters with the ideas and originality of this brilliant directori was all shuddered about 70 percent of the moviei was so happy and full of satisfaction that i was actually watching the movie which i havent seen for a long timei was so in the story and felt the feelings of anyone inside of me i felt like i was there by myself and doing the same i felt like i to become someone amazing i be as good as them i to be a part of the fraternityi was sitting there in the cinema after this movie and to see the sequel to see more of this unique and universal type of movie to find something as good as this was all ive,fantasy
this movie is terrible so bad in fact that i walked out of the movies theatre with something like 2030 minutes to goit is an action film but that doesnt mean the screenplay needed to be quite so bad i mean the plot could have been written in 10 minutes by a 5 year old the directing was also pretty poor with just no sense of suspense to hold the endless action sequences togethermatrix style special effects yippeeyawn but it takes more than that to make a film  like a good idea for exampledont get me wrong i like a good action film but this just doesnt cut the mustard the highlight for me in the film was hearing the nine inch nails song every day is exactly the same on the movie theatres surround sound,fantasy
i didnt expect to see realistic action scenes going into this movie but when i actually did see itwhoa yes all the incredible stunts and assassinations they perform in this movie are extremely entertaining but the accompanying storyline was very subpar in my opinion getting assassination orders from the loom of fate thats just silly not to mention exploding rats cmon what were the writers on when they put this into the story the point in the movie that really pushed it into the bad movie category for me was the scene where the train cars were falling off the bridge i know this is a movie that defies the laws of physics but how anyone escaped with their lives after that scene baffles me foxs final set of executions was just icing on the terrible movie cake if it werent for the incredible action sequences and screenplay i would actually be mad that i paid to see this movie,fantasy
a young man finds out his long lost father is an assassin and when his father is murdered the son is recruited into his fathers old organization and trained by a man named sloan to follow in his dads footstepsanyone who knows me knows that i love cgifilled movies especially speed racer 300 the matrix sky captain and the world of tomorrow and the likes i tend to like cgifilled movies more if they actually focus on the plot and this is that kind of movie yes what you get here are some of the best action sequences youll ever see in the big screen along with a decent plot with some nice and sometimes predictable twists and turnsthis is no doubt one of the movies to see this summer what i liked about this film was that it keeps you entertained from beginning to end even though its a big smash and bash kind of action movie you think you would have seen every action scene you had ever seen especially after the mildly entertaining and mostly boring action scenes from the incredible hulk well youre wrongthe style and action in here is so like the matrix which has never been done before outside the matrix trilogy that the movie is actually adds a fresh and original quality to action films if possible the performances in here are fantastic especially hearing dialog you had never heard from morgan freeman james mcavoy and angelina jolie both have a lot of fun in this movie as well as the other castif you come in here to see a realistic action film you might as well watch a documentary this film is so overthetop ridiculous but also a lot of fun its one of the funnest and entertaining time ive ever had in the cinema the style and action is top notch the performances are great and the plot decent what else do you want more from a big blockbuster released over the summer,fantasy
 filling  is a movie with great visual effects and absolute lack of logicthere are a few twists on offer but overall the story line is not all that justifying so while watching this flick put your brains to sleep and let your eyes have a treat there is a lot of entertainment on offer and then there is some good performance from the aging jolie and good acting by the james mcavoy as well if they had tried to push in some reasoning into the script this could have turned out to be a bigger hit and may have well spawned sequels,fantasy
i went to see this movie in digital at my locl cinemark at 1200 in the morning friday i was planning to be amazed but instead i was wondering what else i could have spent 4 on dont get me wrong this movie had some awesome moments but it could have been made better it had exceptional cgi and outstanding action sequences and a lot of good lol moments but the plot twists they kept dishing out left my with only one thought over and over again wtf again every aspect of the movie was great and even the actor looked like they were having fun but they could have had a better endingin the end i could never see this movie again and i would be fine with that this weekend id rather see walle,fantasy
ridiculous script and bullets flying in slow motion if you like that type of movie this is for you for everyone else dont bother  it is unbelievable bad,fantasy
looks like morgan freeman and angelina jolie were seriously short on cashthis movie is not about bending bullets its about bending your common sense,fantasy
remember when you first saw the matrix and you walked out the movie theater drenched in sweat asking your friend in amazement what the hell did we just see this is the first movie i have seen this then that gave me that feeling of utter astonishment of total immersion in a complete insane alternative reality thats no small achievementok yes its not realistic its not even pretending to be realistic ok much of it makes no sense ok it has pretty much no redeeming social value but imagine every piece of lunatic action youve ever seen in a movie crank them up to 11 and splice them together pretty much uninterrupted for 100 minutes tie them together with a story that has you wondering just what crazy thing will happen next and you have imho pretty much everything i want from this sort of movie,fantasy
im not familiar with the source comic book but after two hours of this blockbuster ill not be subscribing anytime soon i know that films like this arent really aimed at my agegroup but when done really well the matrix avengers assemble even i can get itthe movie starts with a bloody bang literally as were introduced to the main trick employed throughout a slowmotion bending bullet something weve already seen before in the matrix and which gets done to death no pun intended as the movie progresses if i was trying to be positive i could say its fastmoving flashy and expensivelooking its much easier though to say its relentless trashy and ultimately empty i didnt like the constant profanity i felt the blood and guts gore was overdone and the sex scenes whilst brief and usually involving wormthat turns james mcavoys boorish bullying socalled best friend banging his girlfriend crude and gratuitous theres precious little leavening humour the body count is massive and accelerates as the finish approaches plus i vaguely mind seeing good actors like mcavoy and morgan freeman wasting and hardly extending themselves in easy paydays like thismcavoy as the central character undergoes the biggest metamorphosis since dr jeckyll drank his potion going from putupon office nerd to a pumpedup killing machine who even gets to snog fellowagent angelina jolie along the way theres a biggish plottwist of the luke skywalker variety and a massive sfx episode involving a train crash but for me the latter wasnt as big as the movie itself from which i found myself derailed very early on and never climbed back on board again,fantasy
movies like this are the result of hollywood embracing the world of comic books i liked to read comics when i was around 10 or 11 years old for a time but comics are no substitute for having friends in a way this is a superior filmif you are the type of person who likes to escape into a world of super heroslike a 10 or 11 year old might for an older crew i think it leaves much to be desired it simultaneously supports the notion that all people in their 20s are talentless losers who have to rely on their fathers reputation of they want to get anywhere in life and additionally supports the notion that older staid type are endowed with super powersas if daddy knows everything its a quick study i think it actually does a disservice to the actors involved with projects like thisbecause at its heart films like this are seriously sappy minus all the little jokes which only support a larger nihilistic premise plus bullets cant go around corners even if you wish it your very hardest,fantasy
this is a movie created solely for outrageous yet fantastic action theres not much of a storyline so if youre the kind of guy looking for a dramatic story full of romance and drama then go find another movie timur bekmambetov pulls out all the stops in a highend outrageous and im pretty sure impossible action movie from an extreme car chase in a beautiful dodge viper to james mcavoy shooting people through the eye socket of some dude they call the repairmanis a movie you can watch when there is nothing to do or if you just feel like watching people get their heads torn apart by bullets and knives once again if youre looking for a good story then dont even bother with this moviejames mcavoy is a great actor and he doesnt fail to impress me here he plays a depressed barely sane broke guy who is sick of his obese and really annoying boss at his deadend job he portrays the character so well and always in this sarcastic tone at the beginning his character then changes into a total badass who completely destroys everything without giving a single st then theres sloan portrayed by morgan freeman who is the boss of the group of assassins morgan freeman is amazing as always playing it cool and not shooting anybody angelina jolie who is definitely not my favorite actress when it comes to action movies plays a traumatized semiautistic woman who doesnt give a crap about anyone there wasnt really much to play for her she sort of just stares awkwardly at everybodyso overall it was a good movie and a good way to pass the time amazing action sequences mixed with blood gore and pretty much a slowmotion every time a bullet is fired not a girls movie thats for sure,fantasy
by how badly made this movie is it was a really disappointing experience for me i watched it with a friend and couldnt even finish it when he asked why i said it was because its basically a guy that kills people he proceeded to respond well you like death note at least death note had a plotwhere to begin in criticizing this film how about the completely unnecessary and exaggerated use of bad words i mean i couldnt find a single line that didnt use fk or st or how about mcavoys performance halfway through the film his high pitched voice and constant yelling really got on my nerves finally the whole movies just really exaggerated and surreal are we really supposed to believe that he could curve bullets and still hit the bullseye or that they obey a loom i knew the movie was gonna be violent but i expected something more like guy ritchie with elaborate plots and effective black comedy if you too are expecting something like this then dont waste your time on this and go watch snatch or lock stock310 for including morgan freeman,fantasy
the is a very awesome moviei felt very excited while i was watching in on my pc i think the most wonderful idea is about the bullet yep nevertheless the bullets fly so fast but our hero can even dodge them whats more he can even curve them that means he can shoot like a circle in my opinion ideas are the most important thing in a movie if you have a fantastic idea even though its only a action it could still attract many audiences i think ive been attracted by the film but there are also some problems in the film some scenes are too violence and theres too much blood and headshots however its an r film so i think it doesnt matter go watch it,fantasy
nothing new in this film just a number of hollywood clichs including the sob story told by a narrator in the third person which ultimately turns out to be their own sob story and even the star wars idea of the central character seeking to avenge their fathers death only for the villain to say no i am your fatherthe rest of the plot comprises of special effects absurdity laughing at not with the film excessive blood and shooting and swearing and achieves nothing by doing so james mcavoy totally lets himself down in this role he was brilliant in last king of scotland but doesnt do himself justice as soon as he starts speaking in a pretty naff american accent his character isnt that believable and his excessive swearing makes him more unrealistic instead of realistic the rest of the cast including veteran morgan freeman are paperthin characters which also lets them down as actors as the characters die it is difficult to be upset as you barely know them or sympathise with themalthough there were some interesting twists in the end they fail to salvage a film thats only purpose was to try and lure people in with mindless violence blood and bad language with very little substance the script is also quite poor like many modern action films in my view this is trying to outdo goodfellas in violence bad language and blood but otherwise would fail miserably in competing on the scale of quality and credibility a further demonstration of unoriginality in hollywood filmmaking,fantasy
this film was quite bigged up during release it looked like it would be full of big explosions guns blazing and stuff and the cast was a big draw for me as well so i watched basically wesley allan gibson national movie award nominated james mcavoy is the anxious and clumsy office clerk with a boring routine an unfaithful girlfriend and an abusive boss and to get over it all he takes stress tablets on a regular day he meets the mysterious sexy and beautiful fox national movie award nominated angelina jolie who informs her that his father who he never knew is dead and then the guns start blazing as the man that apparently did it is after them his father was a member of the ancient organisation known as the freternity and was killed by the skilled and powerful hitman cross thomas kretschmann who betrayed them what wesley thought was high anxiety which he was taking the pills for is actually a talent he adopted from his father giving him the ability of high speed reaction and highly accurate vision therefore he joins the fraternity commanded by sloan morgan freeman they obviously want him to kill the man who killed his father and they start training him to have the same skills they have such as catching high sped things and bending bullets and from this he gains a new personality and attitude eventually he is ready to face danger and go against cross and it all comes to a head on a train where wesley does kill the assassin only to discover this has all been a setup it was in fact cross that was his father so they tricked him into killing the father himself as he was the only person he would never have killed and obviously he is next after a few more chases and stuff it all comes down to a final showdown where it seems all the fraternity are brought together and there is something that means they should really all be dead so fox ends it all and wesley gets his final revenge on sloan in the end also starring terence stamp as pekwarsky common as the gunsmith kristen hager as cathy marc warren as the repairman david patrick ohara as mr x konstantin khabenskiy as the exterminator dato bakhtadze as the butcher chris pratt as barry lorna scott as janice and sophiya haque as puja jolie is cool with her smouldering face and similar flare she brought to lara croft mcavoy does well with the american accent and being the wimp that goes thug and freeman does alright in his time on screen the action sequences with some visually amazing special effects are the big reason to see the film the matriz style moments are a tiny bit laughable but that is part of the fun a not bad action adventure it was nominated the oscars for best sound and best sound editing and it was nominated the national movie award for best actionadventure worth watching,fantasy
so this is a movie about an cult that claims ancient origins and divine purpose nothing out of the ordinary there all cults claim ancient origins and divine purpose and with the same amount of evidence id est none whatsoever this particular cult also kills people and bends space and time with their mind which is slightly less commonnaturally there is a renegade from this cult who serves as the antagonist and a clueless newbie wesley gibson who serves as the protagonist i definitely wouldnt call him a hero the only provably heroic thing he does is kill a guy who kills people for profit gibson also kills a bunch of innocent people and bystanders so definitely not a herospeaking of gibson i keep wondering if im supposed to relate to him in some way like him or identify with him i never do but i usually hate protagonists these days so maybe im out of touchthe cultists randomly select people to kill by picking names out of a hat well not really they have a big random number generator set up clouded in mysticism and holy but its apparent that they could just as easily have chosen names at random out of the phone bookthe renegade left the cult because one day one of the cultists thought hey why not chose our targets to make the world a better place while pocketing some cash for ourselves  gibson wavers a bit between the camps but that is fortunately the closest we get to soul searchingdespite the mumbo jumbo death list generator there isnt enough mysticism in this movie just having the assassins carve runes into the bullets to make them curve and some mystic read the psycic aura of the spent bullets to track the enemy would have made those aspects easier to swallow even a lame use the force william is more than we goton the other hand sometimes the lack of explanations is a good thing for instance had gibsons wavering between the two camps of the cult been made any clearer he would have been forced to make an explicit choice and it would have been a stupid one too much explanation and we get idiocy like the robots are using humans as batteriesignoring all story there are some nice action scenes even in the obligatory knife fight gibson isnt dumb enough to drop his guns which is uncommonly sensible there is also a brief glimpse of angelina jolies backsidebottom line if you want action similar to matrix or crouching tiger hidden dragon and are quick enough to make up your own story so you can ignore the mess that comes with the film can serve as a diversion for an hour and a half,fantasy
the thing i love most about is the dialogue its incredibly witty in several cases and very sharp and the best part is its not just a singular character that supplies all the memorable quotes either the characters played by james mcavoy morgan freeman and angelina jolie respectively all have their moments in the films scriptbut you will notice in my title it says that the action is too zany and heres what i mean the first car chase with the viper is brilliant and it has lots of phenomenal driving just enough to set it apart from other chase scenes without making it look corny but all the action from that point on is simply too wild for me theres just no way in the laws of physics that someone is going to launch a car in the air rotate around in a rolling motion all while shooting the person in the car you are flying over dead it just doesnt happen and neither does someone shooting a pistol at an angle that lets the bullet curve all the way around the perimeter of a circular room i have no limits when it comes to films having zany or overthetop plot lines but i think every movie needs to abide by the laws of physics unless it is a fantasy or science fiction which is notbut other than all of that is a great film and is very underrated all three of the main cast members deliver stellar performances that go together nicely with the several witty lines that you will hear in this film also has a very satisfying ending that will make you say when you get up from your favorite movie chair man that was a fun movieso if you dont mind tons of violence and loads of cursingand you can get past the overthetop action although some may like the style you wont be disappointed by,fantasy
i think this movie is good but not great some of the dialogues in this movie are ridiculous and bad but they dont ruin the film the acting was ok too the cgi is ok sometimes it can look really good and sometimes it looks fakethe action scenes are pretty cool specially the part when wesley goes in to the factory and kills everybody in his path and the music by danny elfman is great and fits the movie perfectlyoverall i think this is a fun cheesy action flick that i think people will enjoy if they dont take it too seriously so i give this movie a 7 out of 10,fantasy
is based a comic book series by mark millar who has written for spiderman superman xmen and wolverine sadly this film did not encourage me to buy the series is an perfect example of style over substance which leads to a heartless experiencefocuses on wesley gibson james mcavoy a young man who hates his office job whom girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend and suffers from anxity attacks one day when he is shopping a woman named fox angelina jolie who tells wesleys father had just been killed by a rogue agent called cross thomas kretschmann and he was the best assassin in the world cross also targets wesley and fox saves his life she takes to welsey to the fraternity of assassins run by sloan morgan freeman who tells him that people are genetically able to become assassins and bend bullets wesley gets the excitement he has been craving and trains hards to use his abilities to the fullest wesley seeks revenge for the death of his father and does as much research as he can about cross to ensure he kills him sloan tells welsey that the fraternity picks it targets using a loom which uses binary code picking targets by fate fox tells welsey the philosophy of the fraternity is kill one save athousand and bring balance to the world and shows her own dark originsthe film is shallow with unengaging characters you wonder why we should really care for welsey throughout the film the themes of fate basically feel like it added to show there is more to the film the film is trying to be the matrix but obviously no where need as good or deep as that film the other major problem of the film is its predictable it was clear from the beginning that the fraternity isnt as good as they made themselves out to be the plot is very thin and clichdthere are some positives from this film they is a good cast mcavoy jolie freeman and kretschmann are all top actors its also good to see marc warren to be in a hollywood film some of the action scenes were very well done you would like it if you like highoctane action i think timur bekmambetov has potential to be a good director in hollywood as long as he good material his next film 9 looks like it would be goodfelt like a film made for 12yearold boys with added sex and violence2 out of 5,fantasy
of king of the emptyheaded eyecandy movies but has to do it with a speed racer quality script the results are kinetic but utterly forgettable james atonement mcavoy is an nerdish accountant ripped from his obnoxious life by angelina you have to ask jolie and a bullet fired by a slumming thomas stalingrad kretschmann wham bam thank you maam and mcavoys an instinctual superassassin charged with bringing his purported fathers killer a steaming helping of titfortatjolies got the tats and the others and otherwise respectable actors like morgan driving miss daisy freeman and terence the collector stamp take undoubtedly sumptuous paychecks enacting the slim comicbook plot but its all for naught the visuals are fine and dandy lots of whoohoo bullet trajectory shots and physically impossible stuntwork and a pounding soundtrack and so on and so forth and it all still comes to naught the characters are cardboard cutouts the dialogue is fight club lite and even more pretentious in short everything is such a cartoon that it packs all the emotional wallop of a looney tune that in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing of course but in the case of it is its such an obvious stab at setting up a new franchise that it instantly deflates itselftimekiller viewing only check brain at door it gets a six from me strictly for the stylish visuals and even then just barely director timur nightday watch bekmambetov is quite capable but this dispensable junk was not really up to his standards watch at your own risk of boredom and ridicule,fantasy
im not even sure what to say about this movie yet it was so bizarre that i feel like i have to say somethingfirst off the idea and concept are intriguing the whole loser guy being recruited by some secret fraternity in which he is the new superstar is always fun it gives every average joe the idea that it could happen to them it is a formula that many movies have followed with success and as with most cases the hero prevails in the endthe problem with this movie is its ridiculous action and mind numbing lack of reality flipping cars curving bullets seemingly inhuman ability to recover from all wounds because of some waxall of it is so contrived and impossible that it takes the movie into places it should just not go the parting shot where angelina jolie kills everyone with one curving bullet is beyond impossible even if you could curve a bullet the ballistics and physics of bullets are violated all movie long but this parting shot is just so stupid that it makes the less stupid parts of the movie seemyou guessed itmore stupid a bullet from a pistol would not travel through 7 skulls even in a straight line yet here it does so in a circle even beyond the stupid bullet tricks was the stupid twists in the plot the entire fact that these people kill because a cotton loom tells them to via some impossible code it just silly especially given the fact that there is no explanation of why they started following the loom in the first placethen there are the plot points that are seemingly forced into the fold as last second thoughts the main character learns to be a super killer because he gets the crap beat out of him they seriously teach him to fight by beating him up over and over again within an inch of his life somehow that turns him into a calculated killeragain very odd and never explained and hes killing his father and defending his honor all in no order that makes sense or furthers the plotoh wait it was explained by the fact that the hero has the ability to process more adrenaline than normal humans so he can slow down everything he seesso apparently beating him to near death taught him how to control it ok wellmaybethe acting in the movie was fine all the characters were believable for the most part there were even some moments of comedic levity that made you smile and there were more than a few amazing and fun action scenes those elements were ok which was why i gave it a 5 and not a 3the movie should have really been billed as a scifi flick and not an actionadventure spy movie which is what it seems to be on the surface but really there was too much impossibility to even be plausible and that takes away from the movie some of those impossible elements could have been left out and the plot would still have worked but the confusing and pointless plot twists were silly and only convoluted the entire thing,fantasy
i saw this movie when it came out ages ago i only just read the graphic novel out of curiosity as a movie its watchable and even enjoyable just like everyone else said its a worse version of matrix but its still a pretty decent movie but compared to what mark millar managed to do its a load of shthead what happened to the massmurderer wesley the one that kills and rapes for fun the amazing plot line of the graphic novel has nothing but nothing to do with the movies where did they get the idea of threads seriously where does that come from the movie has nothing to do with the gn and if you despised the movie give the book a shot i had so much more fun reading the gn than watching the movie i give it a 4 for butchering the story,fantasy
does anyone know the label and style name of the leather jacket that cross wears possibly where to get one too its the one that wesley later inherits and wears himself its just a way cool jacket i think i did much enjoy the movie but finding that jacket i think makes it more that worth while all i need do now is to find what and where it is ive been looking for a leather jacket for sometime now but have yet to discover one that i like until i viewed the film thats the one that i want if you know anything useful regarding that awesome jacket please let me know thank you for taking the time to at least preview my comment,fantasy
which means this is really bad movie for those who want a break from the xbox heres a movie to vegout in front of    a movie with just as much insight character development maturity plausibility and intelligence as a video game and with similar graphicsthe movie tries to stand somewhere between fantasy and reality with characters jumping through plate glass windows onto the roofs of skyscrapers across the street and the like our heros girlfriend is screwing his best friend as the atm machine reminds him all this without having to fuss with a joystick none of it works for a minutethis is an action film from the age of the 15second sound byte the epoch of no discernible attention span i recommend watching bullitt the french connection 48 hrs or virtually anything else instead,fantasy
this movie has one of the best opening scenes of the new millennium for all those that think this is a matrix rip off obviously are not over their hopes of another matrix movie this movie has an allstar cast and back to back action throughout the movie bullet bending obviously is not possible but then again neither is an et or mutant zombies but that does not stop people from flocking to the theaters to watch the movie easily one of the best movies i have seen in a long time if you are not a fan of action movies then this movie has nothing for you on the other hand if you are open to the suggestion of bullet bending as the second hand premise for an awesome story line and get past the fact that it is hollywood and movies are for entertainment purposes only then i would strongly suggest at least the rent to form your own opinions of this movie ironically enough that is also part of the story line form your own opinions and stop being a victim,fantasy
the main characters development was appalling ive been punched in the face before and it didnt teach me how to become a world class killer it taught me that i didnt like getting punched in the face if they to be a stereotypical action movie then the whole teaching montage should have some point between whining like a baby and becoming a pro i liked the actor in the last king of scotland because he played a great spineless wimp but too many of those same qualities came through on this character killing some one as they are saving you makes the audience hate you no one likes a back stabber if you have to kill them and you are that close have some dignity and use a knife this actor does show great potential and i hope he does not get pigeon holed in to being a wimp whatever he does he should stay away from action movies,fantasy

james mcavoy hits a career setback in this disjointed unoriginal action flick about a fraternity of assassin weaverswesley struggles in the rat race day after day hiding from hideous boss janice in his cubicle popping pills for anxiety while aware that his girlfriend and best mate are at it behind his backthis is an unlikely start for a superhero but wesley discovers he is descended from a line of superassassins who go back a millennium he undertakes training in order to kill the rogue assassin who shot his own fatherpretty quickly the inconsistencies and coincidences seep in and sink this film the assassins victims are chosen by a loom no explanation given the assassins heal their wounds by bathing in a magical fluid no explanation given they are capable of gravitydefying feats no you get the ideain a perhaps unintended irony david ohara is presented as mcavoys father both actors struggling to suppress their scottish accents under an american one the fraternity can defy physics but linguistics seems to defeat them what is it about scottish male actors that they cannot master an american accent the guilty include brian cox sean connery john hannah ewan mcgregor kelly macdonald shows the women are differentit is all very flat and unconvincing why did the loom start to name the fraternity as targets if they were a problem why didnt the loom just name itself for destruction what brings about jolies change of heart at the end the comedy is tepid the youre the man line being a typical example all in all a bit of a waste of time,fantasy
this movie deserves at least a 8 if not 85this move has everything it is a rapid and fast action thrillride with a great portion of humor staggering action scenes and a stunning looking angelina joliethis movie truly combines and spoofs i might add the good parts of several movies matrix spider man kill bill and many more i am sure that you will notice the little hints which remind you of those movies it has some of the best and most amazing action scenes i have seen in a long timevery fun to watchan exciting ride from the first minute to the endbe advised that the movie in parts also contains a lot of bloody violence nevertheless we enjoyed it big time as one of the recent really good and entertaining action movies  without actually getting old or creating the impression of an rewash of other moviesgreat georg,fantasy
i actually had fun watching the movie never sure if i was laughing at the absurdity of it all or the fact that i managed to have fun even if the films script is nonexistentweavers that form an assassins league  a machine that spits out target names  curving bullets  flying in circles at some point they decided a cohesive script would get in the way of the special effects the story is so silly and without reason that in the end of the movie you feel unsatisfied its not like matrix or other movies where you feel immersed in a different reality that the magic of it all makes senseim specially sorry that such a promising young actor is losing his time making such a silly movie the action is still good matrix wannabe in many ways but fun just dont bring your brain along,fantasy
a film which has to be seen with a very open mind and has to shut your logic part of the brain coz the plot and execution was way too over the top but it served its purpose and entertained me thoroughly for 105 minutes with great unrealistic thrills and spectacular visuals story is about wesley an account manager when realizing that his father who died just a day ago was an assassin and a part of the fraternity of assassins is being recruited to join his dads organization by sloan morgan freeman to kill his fathers assassin movie has many moments inspired from other highly successful action thrillers like matrix fight club etc good performances from james mcavoy angelina jolie n morgan freemanscript was just avgbelow avg n direction was racy and you get to see angelinas cute bum also,fantasy
i desperately want to love this film despite the fact it has plot holes all over the place the film is based on a comic book style heros of good and evil but who are the bad guys the nearest possible reference with regards to the style and content is the matrix with all the bullet time action and superhuman feats although the film is stylish it suffers from a vague familiarity that just nags in the back of your mind its never really explained how these guys got their power which for me is an important aspect the film is basically done in four acts 1 dweeb with uninteresting life explored 2 dweeb taken to secret society to learn of his untapped powers 3 dweeb becomes superhuman assassin 4 hero seeks revengenot a bad tale by any stretch of the imagination james mcavoy carries of both sides of his personality well even if he is somewhat annoying in the first car chase sequence with all the screaming he does angelina jolie looks stunning however she is underutilised in this role which is a shame as she is capable of more morgan freeman is treading water here with yet another old sage role that seems to epitomise his career terrence stamps role was all but a cameo common was wooden and marc warren may have grunted occasionally the supporting casts were really not given very much to do but be background fodder this was a mistake given some of the work they have done previouslysome of the scenes are probably stretched too far and become a little tiresome for instance the training segments really didnt need to be so indepth we got the picture and could have moved onthat said on the whole the film is entertaining with twists and turns towards the end you may or may not see coming jolies actions in the showdown sequence with the other assassins seemed unnecessary without some serious inventive writing i seriously doubt there will be a sequel for many of the characterswell worth the price of a ticket at the cinema just tune in turn off and watch the action,fantasy
i must say i had expectations about this movie all the buzz about this new matrix caught my attention i wasnt defrauded is a great movie its not the new matrix but as far as attempts go this is the best so far there is obviously some things in common again youll see some random looser discovering he has amazing skills and he is not just an ordinary man and then he struggles to find his path the thing is matrix was not only special effects and slow motion the concept was amazing the duality between real and fiction and the idea that maybe what were experiencing is not real was revolutionary and freshthe matrix is a mark in the history of cinema both visually and conceptually has the visual but the plotits just ok it doesnt blow us away and there are some plot holes along the ride still is a really good moviethe narration was a good optionfightclub anyoneand the dark humor made me crack several times this is the way to put comedy into action the special effects are obviously amazing its all done very stylishly james mcavoy excels in this role morgan freeman was casted just to draw more people to see the movie because he has like 10 lines and boy do i love the new look of angelinashe looks like a skinny drug addict with huge amounts of eye shadowbut a really hot one and she has that cool attitude you just cant get enough many people are saying is forgettable well probably but only because the matrix came first if you are looking for the perfect movie a masterpiece this is not for you this is an action packed movie with great special effects great leading actorlots of humor and all this put together very nicely,fantasy
what to say about this movie that hasnt been said first off it was pretty much just a rip on the matrix all with the physicsdefying moves and the bullet curving and the slow motion but i think thats the point of it i mean it continues the matrixstyle but it never really fulfilled it in the beginning you see wesley gibson as a man and the narrative was just like edward nortons tyler durden a man who is stressed out in his daily life and talks about the things that interest him in this case the keyboard in the beginning you see wesley as a bullied person by his over weight boss who uses the stapler to make him more stressed and also by his best friend who has sex with his girlfriend and calls him a pussyangelina jolies character comes in saves him from cross who is supposedly the man who killed wesleys father she takes him into the fraternity where he is trained into an assassin you see him get beaten up get stabbed and also get threatened you find out that wesleys stress level is just adrenaline which helps him to become an assassini found the curving bullet to be a cool idea actually when it was used in the ending when fox angelina jolie used it to make a roundhouse suicide it was just corny but the bullet colliding was good toowhen you find out that cross is wesleys father i was very disappointed it was just another fail at an attempt to make a plot change and make you go oh my god and how they explained how he was his father and how he was trying to protect wesley from going to the fraternity was terrible i mean he was shooting him on the train so how could that be protecting him there are some flaws but i found this an alright movie it isnt the best and i dont think its really worth seeing,fantasy
fun movie of course action packed i see all the criticism but i dont understand there was actually a story outlandishyes but i like the crazy parts of itbesides the loom of fate stuffthat was a little weirdbut i got it eventuallythe acting is very good james mccavoy is a starwhat can i say about morgan freemanshoot that m laugh out loudbest line of the movie nice special effectsvery gorybut i like  i really enjoyed myself 8 out of 10 i recommend it 2 allits not perfectbut its not bad at allits just what we need this summeri know the fans of the comic are upset but they should enjoy this filmacause it syays truein the bueinning and makes something good wit the some of the source materialand i think makes a good representation of the comics,fantasy
this marks the fourth movie i have seen that stars james mcavoy like the other three movies i enjoyed his performance he plays wesley gibson an average day american who has a job he hates and a girlfriend who doesnt respect him one night as he walks into a store a mysterious called fox angelina jolie walks up to him and tells him that his father was an assassin who was killed on top of the metropolitan building she then saves his life from a ruthless assassin and introduces him to a secret organization called the fraternity led by sloan morgan freemanthere he learns about his true past and follows his fathers footsteps as being a trained killer however things are never as they seem is an action flick with an r rating nothing much more theres plenty of blood and gore in it many times in slow motion showing the bullets tear through people and making unpleasant exit wounds much of the time i felt like i was watching the presentday version of 300 this made the action at times boringin addition many of the action sequences are stylized with unrealistic circumstances for instance the first action sequence it has a man jump through a window pull out again and shoot the bad guys on the building across from him never missing a hit then reaching the other building which is probably a block away from the one he jumped out of without an injury from the glass that would have torn him to shreds uh the other thing i found almost comical was the idea of the assassins curving bullets okay you just fling your gun pull the trigger and pray to god that you hit your target come on in some instances when two guys do this and fire their weapons simultaneously their bullets collide another impossibility maybe i just like the bourne ultimatum too much or i like the matrix so much that anyone else copying off of the wachowski brothers ideas makes me laughthere isnt a whole lot of dialog said in the movie save for james mcavoy who also narrates the movie adding some offbeat humor to the film morgan freeman wasnt too bad in his role and angelina jolie was a sexy killer that wasnt fearful of showing her butt i like that i liked the action sequences even though theyre extremely impossible to do it was a good for the seven dollars which it cost me but i wont give it anything else 710,fantasy
like so many modern hollywood moves looks and sounds great but is a poorly conceived and written and is ultimately not a good movie its another in a long list of movies that is technically excellent but uninspired and unfulfillingwhat killed the film for me was that it was utterly ridiculous from top to bottom from the opening scene you think you are watching something like the matrix but the movie never gets around to explaining how these assassins attain superpowers if i could train hard for a few months getting the sht beat out of me and bathing in krispy kreme sugar and somehow develop superpowers to defy all know laws of physics i would get started right away it wants to look and feel like reality but unlike comic book movies like ironman it asks you to swallow way more implausible nonsense than you may be able to stomach in fact ironman looks like a documentary compared to this noisy overdone rollercoaster i did not know going in that the movie was based on a comic about superheroes and supervillians they should have committed more to thatthere effort to make the movie real just made it a sloppy messso its a fantasy film that i found difficult to get into the action is well done the effects look great but its another case where you are lucky not to have an epileptic fit by the first hour from all the flash cutting and gimmicks half the movie is in bullet timeand then of course there is the loom which is just a retarded concept and in the face of everything else i found myself rolling my eyes if they had spent half the time they spent on effects working on the story we would all have been better offjames mcavoy does his best with what hes given and its his performance that keeps the movie from slipping even further into the abyss jolie is always great but not given much to do here but look sexy evren buyruk from usa,fantasy
this film is definitely for teen boys who fantasise about angelina jolie and guns and all that stuff i may almost fit this category but this film didnt convince you in any way to take it seriouslywhich is what it tries not to do despite this whole assassin story with a father son revenge thing how original you could hardly call this entertaining when so many things are ridiculous james mcavoy may be trying to get into mainstream movies but this really doesnt show him off very well this feels like a matrix film and arent we all sick of that by now morgan freeman plays another pointless role as that figure head guy who looks out for everyone yawnand it is totally unconvincing none of the characters really haev any substance the ending which i wont reveal is not a very convincing one at all and leaves you feeling more stupid at the end it is more of a direct question to the audience that mcavoy asks what have you been doing lately not worth your money,fantasy
wesley is a common man he works as a sales representative no make that a sales manager his days are spent in a cubical writing reports and he answers to a belligerent overweight red headed beast of an office manager who takes out her high school outcast past on her charges add to this he knows his girlfriend is cheating on him with his supposed best friend he is hooked on anti stress pills and he is flat broke enter ms jolie  need i say more  her name is fox and she introduces him to the organization that will make a new man out of him or will it  nothing is as it seems and wesley is in for the ride of his life  and so are we the action is quick paced and the script is witty to the last line which had the theater i was in cheering as the credits rolled,fantasy
there is nothing redeemable about this writhing pile of cinema refusethe plot is stretched so thin you can read through itthe action is so over the top ridiculously unbelievable that i actually laughed out loud several times during the moviethe acting is mediocre at best and by the end of the movie i just couldnt wait to walk away,fantasy
i enjoyed this film and i almost got as far as calling this the perfect action film as i was typing the summary of my review because of how the movie includes everything that an action film fan hungers on when action fans watch basic action movies they are commonly left unsatisfied with the movie because of how it is exactly the same as the last action film they watched and how those are usually missing the ingredients that they want in their steak and instead just rely on grease action films want bones in their steak and what this film fully succeeds in is giving us the brutality of bones in our steak instead of overdosing on the cheesiness of grease the film still has a bit of grease but it is enjoyable grease the brutality of the violence is created intentionally over the top and is used as an advantage for some dark humoured laughs this means that although we still have the cheesiness of a normal action movie it serves as a proper ingredient that mixes well with the brutality in it and instead of just relying on cheap recycled and clich explosions it relies on bringing us some hilarious scenes of brutal bloody gory torture and the mean spirited cheesiness of this is what every action film fan lusts for if you are one of those die hard action film fans then this better get on your watchlist or you will be surely missing out,fantasy
this movie is one of the worst clich ridden badly written badly made pieces of schlock i have ever seen and thats putting it mildly just when you think it cant possible get stupider it constantly amazes youjolie is looks and behaves like shes planning on adopting the lead male into her troupe of children through out their kiss at some point in the movie is utterly passionless  as you would expect with a mother and her son i cant understand why that even made the cut frankly i dont know why any of these actors are in this movie ok fine so they got paid i get thatthe accent of the fat bearded assassin is so dire that i actually spat out tea during one of his hilarious eyerollingly bad training sequences in fact whole movie is riddled with clichs and bad dialogue unconvincingly acted out so much so that its sheer ghastliness prompted me to write his review on an otherwise normal albeit slightly dull work daythat being said if you are in the mood for a little lobotomy by all means watch this,fantasy
let me just get this straight out of the way i fking hated this movie and you know its not like i knew i was going to hate it when i first saw the trailers for this movie back in early 2008 i was hyped up i thought the whole curving bullets thing looked awesome i didnt get to see it in theaters because i was 15 my mom wouldnt take me and my dad hates angelina jolie so it slipped from my mind then around mid 2010 i was browsing a pawn shop and found a copy of the film for 5 dollars so i bought itwhy do i hate this movie well i think the biggest problem has to be the premise just the fact that these people kill because a magical loom is telling them to through binary code what proof do they have that this loom is magic besides an old tale well it turns out foxs parents were killed because a man that shot them wasnt taken out by a member of the fraternity not only is this idea stupid its a ripoff of minority report in that film three psychics called preclogs tell when a murder is going to happen before it happens then precrime stops them and throws them into a vegetable state im sorry but this whole magic loom idea doesnt make any sense if it tells the murder of any human on the planet then it would never stop if its only chicago then was this loom really found in chicago does it just adapt to its surroundingsforget the plot how about the fact that the acting is awful morgan freeman is the only one to give a descent job everyone else is just bland the characters are annoying especially wesley he takes wimp to a whole another level im a wimp and i probably would be the st out of this guy if i ever saw him hes that annoying hes basically what would happen if you put shia labeouf and micheal cera together and took out all likabilityoh and another thing this movie stretches the suspension of disbelief around the freaking earth before it finally just breaks i called bullst so many times from surviving a fall into a river 100 feet and not breaking any bones to this newcomer taking down the entire fraternity in just a couple minutes and shooting a bullet all the way across town through a donut coffee and finally through morgan freeman and you know i could handle all that i mean i love 2012 i love cloverfield i like a lot of action and disaster movies that you need to suspend your disbelief to enjoy but theres one problem this movie is boringthe first time i tried watching this i fell asleep half way thorough and the second time i actually had to fight to stay awake the action in this movie isnt very interesting first of all it looks like its ripping off the matrix but the editing is a mess its always jump cutting it nearly gave me a headache the only enjoyable parts of this movie were morgan freeman and the train derailment oh and the plot holesi normally dont mind plot holes i mean one of my favorite steven spielberg movies is war of the worlds and that had a lot of plot holes but here are a few reasons i forgave the plot holes in wotw and not in1 likable characters 2 awesome action 3 great special effects seriously the cg bullets in look like st 4 actual suspense 5 entertainment valueeven wotw had an annoying character racheal who i could forgive because i was having fun i dont have fun with not only does this movie suck but its unbelievably overrated the film currently has a 72 on rotten tomatoes and a 69 on imdb this currently stands as the second most overrated film i have ever seen after the hurt locker but the hurt locker is a much better film dont misunderstand me if you like the movie thats great im happy for you but personally i cant stand it and ive never read the comic so im not upset that they didnt follow the source material the film was just a mess full of plot holes annoying characters boring action and tons of bullst the only reason it doesnt get a 1 is because it isnt the worst movie ive ever seen and thus it automatically gets a two damn you uwe boll,fantasy
wow this movie is so stupid its almost funnythe one thing youll be really surprised at is how the director got angelina jolie and morgan freeman to be in this movie its b grade to say the leasti do not mind b grade films i sat through death race and alien vs predator without problems but in every movie its all about the execution and the execution is too hard to digestthe plot is that some office worker finds out his father is an assassin and that he will become one and learns all these special matrixstyle abilities and kill the person that killed his fathernow here is the twist angelina jolie and morgan freeman are the bad guys not the good guys and the person that played the bad guy is really his father and the assassin is a randomthe problems when the plot i explained unravels further and when the twist is revealed it falls further in quality flat on its face what the hell is this movie trying to be,fantasy
too silly for words i dont like movies that on the inside try to appear to be serious but on the outside are completely ridiculous and this film is one of the most ridiculoussilly movies ive ever seen please dont try to be real when characters are shooting bullets and some how making them curve in mid air so silly the action stunts such as when fox is hanging out of the front widow shield of the red sports car firing a gun so stupid and why would part of the training to become a killer involve beating a trainee up repeatedly even stabbing them in the hand or how about at the end when fox fires a bullet and it magically travels in a circlethe one good part is angelina jolie is looking as good as shes ever looked in a movie her make up and hair are perfect for super sexy killerfinal verdict not even worthy of being called a popcorn flick the plot was awful and i cant believe they are talking about a sequel dont waste your time with this,fantasy
is it just me or did jolie have about 5 lines in this movie most of those were simply one word answers its ridiculous that directors will spend absurd amounts of money on below par actorsactresses the only one i somewhat enjoyed was the main character because it seemed like he was the only one there actually trying to act as for the storyline it was pretty decent between this and jumper id have to go with this because its pretty much just an action movie and not an action spoiled by a two bit romance plot type deal too much special effects not enough common sense less angelina jolie standing around and more hand to hand stuff the ending was pretty awesome though ill give it that still only gets 3 stars,fantasy
this movie continues the clichd comic book story that has been done many times before about an ordinary man finding out he has powers it is very entertaining as he learns his powersthis movie however is original in that instead of using his powers for good ie spiderman with great power comes great responsibility he uses his power for his own personal benefit it also deals with the evil nature of the group of extraordinary people known as the fraternity rather than most groups of people with powers use their power for good ie justice league another thing that is refreshing is how this has an r rating instead of the usual pg13 ratingthis movie bothers a lot of elements from other movies mainly fight club and the matrix fight club in that a man in a white collar job is haunted by his life being nothing and later getting involved in violence and extreme activities and the matrix mainly just cuz of the action sequences and similarities between fox angelina joele and trinity and some of the training is similar fox taking wesley to run across a trainbut regardless of the lack of originality this is entertaining as hell and i think is more homage to classic stories than a complete rip off,fantasy
angelina jolie as eye candy cannot save this film about superhuman assassins that get their kill orders from a magic loom im not kiddingin addition to the ridiculous premise that cant decide if it wants to be magic or technology there are impossible coincidences  incredibly impossible coincidences can you imagine beating someone over the head with a computer keyboard such that the buttons pop off and spell words in mid air plenty of gimme a break moments and a deus ex machina or fiveif you want wild action try a hong kong action film instead,fantasy
plot what starts out as a normal cubical working pansy wesley james mcavoy but then finds out from a beautiful girl assassin named fox angelina jolie that his father didnt die when he was very young but died that day and was one of the worlds best assassins in the world and worked for a secret organization now the organization wants wesley to join to kill his fathers killermy spiel from movies like shoot em up and your normal run and gun movies this is a step above them from a actual story that you can relate to with a main character that is wasting his life at a crappy job and a girl friend who cheats on him with his best friend wesley finds out that his panic attacks arent that at all but a special gift to enhance and slow down time and give him special abilities that a small fraction of the world have a tale of revenge and a lot of sweet death scenes to very cool death shots the acting in this i really enjoyed and having morgan freeman in this doesnt hurt i was so glad because at a point in the movie i thought a to be continued messages was going to pop up then we would never know what happened to wesley and his true enemy this is a movie about truly getting even with all your enemies 2008review 810,fantasy
so maybe the plot could have used a little more work and the bullettime effect was overused but this movie isnt supposed to get an oscar for best storytelling or least bullettime in a movie anyway its supposed to be about killing mofos with quite a bit of flair and it succeeds in that regard some might say that is a ridiculous movie while others might say its awesome your opinion depends on whether or not you want to forget about the laws of physics for 2 hours excluding the saw films has some of the most aweinspiring kills i have ever seen in a movie and made me want to go register a handgun so i can try my hand at bending bullets and such for all of you who thought this movie was garbage because its got mystical looms and weird healing baths remind yourself that building an epic story with the best characters ever conceived of probably wasnt the intention of the director this is entertainment not something thats supposed to make you ponder on the plot for days after watching it,fantasy
is a great out of this world and totally unbelievable action film that stays true and close to the action jolie and mcavoy truly are on form delivering slick lines as well as hyping up the timelessly exciting action morgan freeman is as usual his mainstream best playing the villain and ho also delivers one of the best lines of the  shoot this mother fucer i mean what kind of an old man would say that these day the slow motion shots credit the directors work and ability to make a memorable action film although a bit repetitive doesnt disappoint or let the viewer feel ashamed because its trying to be like the matrix but the good thing is that it can relate to it and in a positive wayby all means is definitely not a classic as such is the matrix but for complexity action and the wicked slow motion it is like it,fantasy
is truly one of the most excessive movies ever made and completely unrealistic but he action is very amusing pure eyecandybut plot wise this is one of the worst films ive ever seen its fast full of action and totally braindead in a word its full of crap james mcavoy is the best actor in this movie but ive seen him perform better angelina are on autopilot so is morgan freeman this is bekmambetovs first hollywood production and to be honest none of his films are good except night watchaction fans who want action guns blood braindead violence will be pleased but i better,fantasy
is one of the biggest blockbusters of 2008 it was based on loosely on the comic book miniseries by mark miller it was directed by timur bekmambetov and this was his first american film after the very popular russian film series night watch it made over 50 million in its first week and came in second at the box office wesley gibsonmcavoy is a nobody trapped in a boring world his wife cheats on him his best friend is a backstabber and he has a boss that wont get off his back when an assassin named foxjolie tries to initiate him into the fraternity his life is changed forever he learns that his father was one of the best assassins in the world and he must no walk in his footsteps he leaves his nothing life and joins the fraternity he must undergo a grueling initiation and then hunt down the man that killed his father has decent character development wesley gibson is a threedimensional main character he has problems with his drone life and has a desire to get out of it but never tries to do anything about it until the assassins come along he is given unique personality traits like apologizing too much and this does become funny later in the movie when it becomes sarcastic wesley changes a lot in the movie something that is missing from most action flicks the problem with the character development is that supporting characters are lacking sloanfreeman is the leader of the fraternity and he doesnt become anything more than morgans usual mrwise a secret about him is revealed at the end but it still doesnt help too much fox doesnt become anything more than the awesome assassin the only thing they did to help develop her was to give her some background information she couldvie had less development but she still needed more cross the man who we think is the main enemy isnt very well developed either he is in the same boat as fox hes given background information but is rarely seen doing something other than shooting a gun the other fraternity members dont have any characterization at all like the repair man and the gunsmith some of the characters are even stereotypes like the mean boss and the snobby girlfriend has a good plot it is structured well with wesley not being able to turn back after act 1 and a great setup for the climax after act 2 there is even symbolism in the movie with a draw bridge coming apart it symbolized the end of wesleys old life there are many obstacles put in wesleys path of killing cross the screenwriter made sure that becoming a fraternity member wasnt an easy challenge wesley has to suffer through multiple beatings fighting an expert with knives and other grueling challenges there is a great twist in the middle of the movie which made the movie way better the ending is very entertaining it starts off with a big bang that was planted since the beginning of wesleys life with the fraternity there is constant fighting with some very creative kills there is even a very nice trap set for the lead villain one problem was that the action was either overdone or illogical in parts in one scene wesley hits a man with a keyboard and letters fly off spelling a phrase im not aloud to repeat also some of the car stunts are stretched too far does have unique settings wesleys apartment being next to a train is a good setting because it shows how sad his life is and foreshadows later events the office is a good place to show how average his life is the textile mill is a good place to put the fraternity as it seems true to what the fraternity is about the meat packing part of the fraternity is cool also and makes for a good place to fight the battle on the train was good for the hot spot of the middle and it was even better to place to on thin tracks going across two mountains this leads to much more tension in the battle when the train falls off has a very good director it was a smart choice to pick a foreign director to get a new perspective on things there is good lighting its bleak in wesleys apartment well lit in the officelike all of them and it is about as dark as it should get the director does a good job of adding to the atmosphere in the beginning we feel like were stuck in a suck life the fraternity has a gritty yet stylish feel to it the music in is great and it adds a lot to the atmosphere we also have a few good rock songs thrown into the mix the special effects arent award winning but theyre good the train falling off the tracks and cars jumping over each other look believable the sound editing is good too with the sounds of bullets hitting people and cars running into each other sounding very real the acting is great morgan freeman is always a good actor although i would like to see him in a different role james mcavoy played a great lead reminiscent edward norton in fight club angelina jolie was the weakest of the group but she was still believable she also shouldvie been the weakest as she had worse material to work with than mcavoy the minor actors like wesleys best friend do good jobs,fantasy
read wesley for spiderman bullet for ring and fraternity for matrix and youve got angelina jolie has become a pretty reliable indicator of crap metoo movies much the way a black cat denotes bad luck think beowulf mr  mrs smith or alexander this one is no different i mean of course she looks hot with her big hair and pushedup boobs and tight outfits but thats because half the budget was spent on hair and makeup the other half went to special effects and extras as a result both angelina and chicago look more dramatic than ever but whats next in a movie that opens with a showdown blood sweat and tears mostly especially for wesley gibson a hapless nobody who discovers he has superpowers and gets entangled in a global counterconspiracy of epic proportions sort of like peter parker or frodo or neo and he doesnt even get the girl think charmed minus the witches plus a lot of pointless violence and even more pompous sermonizing especially by morgan freemans character sloan visually impressive though some sets like the fraternitys library look familiar from the league of extraordinary gentlement perhaps the best part is the frighteningly realistic portrayal of cubicle hell in the movies first half hour,fantasy
i cant help but to want more out of a good action flick is that wrong i am looking for something better than the matrix and terminator 2 and this movie came close real close i think it would have been in contention back in 1999 but still this movie is ahead of its time why because its like the matrix with a plot twist an actual good one at that the sense of humor in this film is wicked and it has some nice action and car chasing the main character james mcavoy does well in his evolution from the anxiety prone desk jockey into a cocky superassassin with tricks up his sleeve angelina jolie is still nice to look at in some scenes morgan freeman is deceptively good in this film too the only reason why i give this movie 8 for 10 is because of the many used concepts from yesterday still it had its own style and its own tricks to make this movie worth watching again,fantasy
when i entered the theater i had some expectations very well made cool visual effects and breath taking action scenes yeah cool very cool in a coolysh way five stars for that im sure that lots of teenagers would freak out of exciting for such cool stuff but what a lack of substance im so disappointed by realizing that such well packed bunch of absurd disgusting rubbish are sold in the hollywood market and permitted to be shown all over the world an example of how sick human being can be first of all for the cruel cynical approach that violently delivers a negative message to the audience from the very first moment you are a loser and violence is the way to solve problems very well thank you now i feel much better my girlfriend almost broke down crying for the nausea i dont care if the story was based on a comic book or even the envelope of a chewing gum it was the director and producers responsibility to bring some sort of meaningful positive message at last to the people if the purpose was to show how sick we are well they made it but i ask to myself whats the point with that i can imagine and understand that a young actor like mr mcavoy could unfortunately choose the be part of such an awful motion picture to grow of experience in his career and actually he made a good performance but im so disappointed that good actors like mr freeman agreed to play such a poor role like that for what not for the high level meaningful contents of the movie itself for sure no comment on mrs jolie i just wonder what the hell she had in mind when she accepted the role did she expect this to be like tomb raider obviously not ok lets face it a movie is just an entertaining product ideally speaking but producers and directors and actors and all the stuff that work on international productions like this should always keep in mind how a single one can really influence some people and inspire them to commit terrible things video games actually do and movies do not differ that way if you want to make sure if its really that bad i would suggest not to throw away your hardly earned money to watch it like i did it doesnt deserve it,fantasy
just back from watching on the premiere it started off pretty good but after about 30 minutes i knew what was waiting lots of bullet time scenes slow motion you name it fun in the beginning but a bit tiring in the end the story is quite hard to really take seriously as with a couple of scenes the whole cinema laughed at the movie when the main character got badly hurt  of course in slow motionp angelina jolie doesnt say much and morgan freeman is not at his besthave you seen snatch it got loads of nice camera angles and clipping techniques but when this movie tries it just get confusing ok its not totally worthless the special effects is good andyeah good special effectsi liked the end but had a hard time with the rest this is what we in sweden say about a movie that is not great or bad middle milkgustaf,fantasy
going by the promos this was supposed to be a decent action movie especially since it starred credible names like angelina jolie and morgan freeman but little did i expect ridiculous action stunts on bending bullets in a nonmatrix environment and then there is the hackneyed plot of treachery and deceit with an unsuspecting protagonist saving this movie is its high octane action that may also sometimes seem improbably comicalwesley james mcavoy is frustrated weakling who on one hand is beleaguered by his fat shrewish boss and on the other hand swallows his pride as his girlfriend is busy sleeping with his best friend his life is all set to change when babe fox jolie takes him to sloan freeman head of a thousand year old secret society of expert assassins who take orders from names of victims that come up from a code of the loom in the fabricjust before he can go on assassination assignments wesley is put through conditioning that involves being beaten up broken bones getting stabbed and all injuries getting cured in a bath of liquid wow if that were true these spas could do better business than hospitals oh yes and then there is a philosophy that they kill people because they can save the world from the damage that the victims could do if they were alive be prepared with suspended logic for the action sequences while car chases are neat the graphics bringing you to the shot and the gun are well done the idea of bending bullets is the most preposterous well for a fact glorifying assassins is never really a good idea either on performances freeman is wasted angelina is too skinny for all the stunts and hard work it is still not worthwhile to be watched on the big screen,fantasy
buy far the worst movie i have seen this year i wish i could get the last 2 hours and 20 minute of my life back god only knows what they were thinking of when they made this movie in my opinion do not waste your money going to see this film it would be a great disappointment to you i have sat through some really bad movies but this one wins the prize for the worst movie of 2008 the plot if there is such a thing in this movie goes all over the place it is far to unrealistic even for this type of movie hollywood needs to stop cloning the same movies over and over and come up with something original i usually like morgan freeman movies it is my opinion that he has never made a bad movie until now so disappointing,fantasy
this movie is great for many reasonsone of them is because it takes peoples minds off the usual everyday routine where most people sit on their desk at work and do every single thing their annoyingly stupid boss demands even if it does this in a quite unrealistic wayanother reason is because it fuses great actors and a great plot which is something really rare and unlikely to find these daysthis movie is said to resemble the movie matrix which is also a great movie but actually the only things they have in common is that these two movies are both quite unrealistic though was not as unrealistic as matrix and that in both movies the leading actors are using guns mainly pistolsso if someone wants to see an action movie he should know that is one of a kind and is a great way to spend two hours of your life which is probably boring p,fantasy
i mean i dunno the movie was fin crazy when it comes to action but when i see movies i like them to make sense call me ahole but still there is no explanation of anything in this movie they just say curve the bullet and viola he curves the bullet wtf then what the hell is going on in the beginning just non sense why the hell did that man leap 300 feet in the air writer says  i dunno i just felt like it was cool lol stupid complexes and to add for those who seen it plus now im just being an analytical asshole if they could curve bullets from 100  feet why the hell do they go through all the non sense of jumping pintos over corvettes to kill a man in a bullet proof limo dumb as hell but cool a effects ya figgadeal me,fantasy
this movie is so far fetched its ridiculous and thats the beauty of it curving bullets secret societies and insanely sexy wet backsides are all in this movie if i do have a beef with this movie its the very transparent plot in the trailer already i knew morgan freeman was the real baddie i was just unsure whether or not angelina jolie was in on it and it took about 7 minutes to see the luke skywalker i am your father piece coming up so yes it was predictable but watching them get there was great fun so no dont expect legends of the fall here or anything remotely serious in this movie just enjoy the pure adrenaline this movie gives off,fantasy
i dont know what the makers of this movie were thinking it is like they could not decide on what was more important a pure action or a good story finally they came up with very good action but a very flawed story line up i was cursing the whole time i was watching this movie very very bad story every once a while hollywood comes with a movie that you just want to get over with i think it was a total waste of time to watch this movie further it shows that even class actors cannot save a bad story line no matter how good their performances are if you are a type of guy who wants the solid substance to back a good action sequence then you will really be disappointed with this movie,fantasy
this movie is so bad that you wish you had a buddy with you at the theater so you could laugh about it unlucky for me i had to suffer through this mess alone the movie has no plot thats it thats all you need to know it has lots of guns lots of shooting lots of angelina jolie acting like an anorexic on heroin but its missing a plot well it does have a semblance of a story but it has so many holes that i wont bother summarizing if you are looking for an action flick or an angelina jolie skin flick stay away the oneliners are so bad they hurt the movie ends with the main characters last words and horrible narration throughout what the f have you done lately well i got dragged to see this turd and will never watch it again,fantasy

this movie is excellent for me  i have watched to many movies including  the godfathers  but touches something else how you can do somethings you do not even imagine that you would do  thats really happens and we can never know if we could do it once more time about angelina she was perfect in this movie like brilliant in mint 2425  she was too cute i guess she should not be killed again in any movies james mcavoy is quite good actor morgan is rocks as well he can convince u pretty easy with his role this movie should have another part with wesley can see the future like next anything but to make another part and fox wouldnot be hurt,fantasy
i went to the theater to see this movie yesterday and i was stunned at how crappy it was i kept hearing about the awesome special effects and stunts huh all i got was tons and i mean tons of visible poorly executed cgi effects zero character development and a plot thats as pathetic as it can get the only reason i give this movie 5 stars is the presence of morgan freeman for whom i have all the respect as an actor it was his name that kept my hopes up until the very end of the movie i thought come on if he accepted to be in this it must become better at some point well it absolutely didnt although its his character only that offers the very few slightly better moments especially towards the end angelina jolie was an interesting skeletal presence at best while the main character was almost unbearable to watch but you can always look past such aspects right well yeah but there arent any aspects left to look forward too the movie is filled with badtaste violence and ridiculous stuns overall the stunt ideas that some people consider spectacular are so silly that you simply stop caring at some point theres one clever twist that manages to sort of catch your interest for the rest of the movie but 5 minutes later youre going to find yourself yawning and shaking your head in disbelief again there may be three or four sequences that youll find enjoyable but thats it dont waste your money on this one its not even worth renting,fantasy
first let me say that i do like stupid fun action movies i love them actually a movie does not have to be brilliantly thought out to just be fun is a fun movie yet it makes even me wonder sometimes what the heck the acting is pretty good morgan freeman james mcavoy and angelina jolie are all good as the main characters other than that everyone is just average but not worse than expected from this type of movie now while the actors might be good the actual characters seemed meh especially the main character wesley gibson actually im not gonna lie i had to look up his name when writing this thats how much i thought his character was worthnot comparing this to the matrix would be dumb because theyre similar movies average loser guy working in a cubicle wants something else and gets it kinda like in the matrix wesley goes through training and learning how everything works only to become a major killer guyyup that sounds right also put in excessive use of cg for just about everything plus gun shootout with main character using two guns shooting a whole bunch of idiots very imaginativethe premise in itself is obviously absurd curving bullets but thats not a problem that would be cool to do whats boring and melodramatic is that every time a bullet is curved everything is in slow mo this is supposed to make you feel like the shooter they learn to control their pulse to slow things down yet it just gets annoying i dont wanna see everything in slow mo in fact almost every actiony motion such as a car flipping over is in slow mo which really dulls the whole thing down a lot its just not effective when something is used every two seconds and in fact the movie could have been a little more fun without such heavy use of itanother thing is the blood its just unnecessary in this case to have so much blood does make you feel like ooo that hurt but who cares if you really dont care about the characters or anything happening james mcavoys character is attempting to kill his fathers murderer yet you never care theres just more and more absurdity that cant be accepted if a movie is overall good i can look over just about anything but this movie was just decent to begin with which only makes it worse when such ideas as the loom of fate supposedly hidden assassination needs are encoded in the loom of fate through mistakes in weaving yeah come up also if they can curve bullets around corners why cant they sometimes even shoot at a guy right there straight ahead it happens believe metheres a decent twist around the beginning of the last third but thats even not really super unpredictable at the end theres a little message from wesley who asks what the f have you done lately really i think i wasted my time with a movie that could have been better is this supposed to make me have some sort of real look into my life or just be stupid fun who knowsoverall i would recommend this movie to people who just like stupid fun also it would probably great with some friends as a rental later on that way you can laugh at it and enjoy it at the same time,fantasy
this is a decent action movie with a plot that probably wouldnt withstand an inspection lead by an academic committeeor even a wannabe film nerd out to slag any movie that even remotely dares to be cool or hip it was entertaining it was violent it had a relatively likable character for whom you develop empathy and that ugly dogfaced creature jolie was not typecast as some kind of sexy femme fatale save for a brief shot of backside nudity which awesomely displayed her bony upper bodyall in all the comparison to the matrix was accurate nobody realizes he is chosen slowmotion bullets the car stunts were good and the acting refrained from treading into silliness like many action movies tend to dorecommended for nonpretentious people who can enjoy a movie for what it isdont mind the stupid whiners,fantasy
the movie started lame there were plenty of holes in the plot kept getting better with the running time never caught up to deserve a 7 rating though imhoi have a few recommendations for those you you who enjoyed the action sequences in the film1 shoot em up fast paced dark action comedy 2 equilibrium good build up scifi christian baleoverall it was a fair experience watching the movie watch it when youre not in a very serious mood being critical while watching it will spoil your enjoyment of the very elusive and unique gunshooting scenesmy rating for 6510,fantasy
i was very excited and very awaiting to watch but when i came back from theater after watching it i said to myself i wasted my time and money actually i was excited because of director timur who gave a very powerful movie day wath but he cant show his brilliant talent in this movie james m is good angelina j is bad and morgan f is also good as always he action sequences shows that the whole cast is a clan of superheroes but they are not only best action seq is the first car chasing sceneremaining are empty very empty specially train sequencei gave 410 just because of james m and car chasing scene,fantasy
first of all let me assure you that im a fun of action flicks since forever and i dont expect a good action movie to have an over intricate plot or an old fashion moral tale at the end of the movie but this one wants to get away as being a blockbuster with just some special effects frankly im disappointed that such a promising cast morgan freeman angelina jolie thomas kretschmann fell for such a lame script as this one nowadays it seems that the movie makers forget one golden rule of film making how to cinematically narrate a story that tells the audience something about themselves from old school like high plains drifter to the contemporary sin city  no country for old men regardless of whether the good guys win or not the moral compass of the story is there now weve sunk to what the f have you done lately gee i dunno ive killed some random guys because the loom told me so come on im giving this movie 610 just because im a sucker for angelina  high speed pursuits,fantasy
this hollywood film of the same russian director who made night watch and day watch  is very similar in effects to his twopart sequel but lacks in depth of the plot as usual timur is at his heights in turning one effect after another but the screenplay although interesting is quite shallow for a russian taste what should we expect from hollywood screenwriters anyway when they started talking about the assassins  i thought they would go further to their roots  in the alamut castle in iran where the first hassassins  islamic ultra sect  was formed the word assassins comes from the name of this sect if the hollywood writers didnt know this at least timur could have helped but no they made it into a fraternity without much connection with history pity also this idea of killing people who would do harm in the future is the same as in minority report on the positive side the unexpected tableturning in the middle is quite refreshing also one cute moment in the movie when the russian guy is helping the main character to recover in some kind of pool he is singing a famous russian lullaby that was funny but surely nobody except russians could appreciate the irony,fantasy
but i still got a kick out of it honestly it was an absurd over the top unbelievable action flick and i got a kick out of itso westley didnt look like eminem and fox didnt look like haley barry and the villains didnt wipe the memory of the heros from existence and so what if the similarities begin and end with the title and the fact that it had something to do with assassinsso whatmark millar actually went on record to say that this film turned out to be the original idea of what he had in mind in the first place but had forgotten about after the story was writtenwho cares it was a pretty cool movie if you suspend all logic and disbelief and for a second consider that you can actually shoot someone in the head across town through glass and cars and trains and so on all while lounging on your easy chair looking at your target through a telescopeyes its absurd but its pretty damn cool at the same timei will say this that the film and the comic both had one very distinct thing in commonthe last thing said in both film and novel were both equally stupidotherwise it was a pretty cool film,fantasy
n the midst of slowmotion action gravitydefying leaps bullettime sequences and curving bullets the hero puts on a pair of sunglasses then promptly takes them off quipping bad idea belongs to the generation of movies after the matrix that have benefited from the success of slomo stylized and choreographed action sequences but distinguishes itself in the most prominent way possible it enjoys what it iswesley gibson james mcavoy is a regular office cubicledweller who discovers in quite style that he is the son of a legendary assassin mastering his 400beats per minute heartbeat to supersense makes him one of the fraternity a group of assassins led by sloan morgan freeman that exist as the hand of fate as fox angelina jolie says kill one maybe save a thousandtimur bekmambetov the russian director of visual stunners nightwatch and daywatch brings the same manic imagination to hollywood that has become his forte kids with toys hardly come up with wilder sequences these setpieces occur in frequent intervals through out the movie with enough story filling inbetween them to make the movie work starting with a jawdropping gunfight involving two skyscrapers almost all of the action is physically impossible so the movie does require a suspension of belief but having angeline jolie as the instigator of most of these scenes only adds to them she resonates the screen with a coolness that makes it far easier to enjoy what could otherwise be quite absurd look out for her scenes with the red car  who else can pull that off with such charm morgan freeman as the leader of the assassins is voice and presence it is always a relief to watch morgan freeman play characters like sloan or the boss from lucky number slevin after all the serious work he doessurprisingly after the movie is over and you have left the cinema you are not left with just an imprint of some screenshots of visual beauty has a life longer than usual popcorn summer movies it has a rare mix of arrogance and humility that brings it closer to home and makes it likable in retrospect saying any more would be giving away too muchmy rating  35 of 5,fantasy
is a riproaring thrill ride that will keep you entertained from start to finish im usually a silent moviegoer so its a testament to the excitement generated during this film that on a couple of occasions i audibly vocalised my amazement at what was happening onscreenthe title seemed slightly arbitrary to me but this may relate to the fact that the film is based a somewhat obscure comicbook series however the plot is patently derivative and owes as much to the very overrated da vinci code and the very underrated equilibrium as it does to the matrix trilogy but this potential weakness did little to offset my enjoyment of the story which delivers a cracking twist at a moment when you least expect itwesley gibson james mcavoy is a complete loser his overweight boss terrorises him his best friend is sleeping with his girlfriend he apologises way too much and cares only about the fact that he cares about nothingabruptly yanked from this humdrum existence by a shadowy band of assassins called weavers he learns from the leader sloan morgan freeman that he has to take the place of his long lost and recently murdered father and so begins an inexorable advance to a showdown with his fathers killerthe phase of the plot where wesley uncovers his fathers almost supernatural legacy introduces several colourful characters chief among which is fox angelina jolie powered by the seething sexual tension between them wesley gradually awakens to the true extent of his latent capabilities but then again jolies deliciouslytattooed hotness is enough to awaken latent capabilities supernatural or otherwise in anyoneunfortunately intriguing plot elements like the history of the weavers and a jawdropping new gun physics werent developed more but this is a petty point because there is already a lot of really good stuff happening in the narrative those plot points may contain the makings of a fanboy sequel but it is unlikely to attract the same stellar cast or live outside the domain of dvdrelease and thats a real pity because i do believe there is a still a solid prequel buried in there somewherevisually the movie is an achievement cgi is powerfully employed to generate violence and carchase imagery that pays due deference to the graphic novel genre from which the story springs nothing revolutionary is presented per se but director timur bekmambetov has reworked definitive elements from other films and definitely taken them up a notchthe acting was the only truly questionable element for me mcavoy may well be the darling of the new generation but he looks hopelessly out of place all the way through this film the benchmark performance for his role was keanu reevess neo who managed to sustain a convincing level of engaged blankness through three matrix films mcavoy by contrast seems incapable of shaking his arthouse aura and makes a play for being serious but he comes seriously undone and his fake american accent does him no favours at all jolie was closer to the mark and left the screen positively drenched with raw sexiness and yes it really is better on the big screen both morgan freeman and terence stamps performances were not given enough space although freeman does have a delightful flourish near the endbut despite being found wanting in some areas is still a thumping good action movie watch it,fantasy
this film was not what i was expecting i thought it would be a typical good guys vs bad guys film but it wasnt it was a message to the viewer a clear message being what the fk are you going to do about your life if youre stuck in a dead end boring non stimulating situationi loved the film for this reason it made clear that what was happening in this film was nighon impossible without cgi but tried to get the viewer to understand that you have a choice if you are willing enough to change your life out the life you are unhappy with then you willthe action was really impressive the idea of the curving bullet was excellent the acting was pretty good not serious like very typical hollywood action style attitude for some nerdygeekyness for others etcit is quite obvious that some ideas from other films are used in this film such as the boring life to adventurous life ie the matrix especially when he is in the cubical with his back to us also the prediction idea of bad guys reflects minority report except the wooden acting of tom cruise is not present in this film and i am sure there are plenty of other bits and bobs that are taken from other filmsthe cinematography could have been better the cgi was really good but sometimes it was too much and it was hard to tell what was going onsome people do not like looking at the text of the film or looking for it and just enjoy it for action or romance or whatever but this film is trying to make an important statement which is made clear by the last line in the film so please listen to it as well as enjoying the arse kicking blood bathing action,fantasy
i believe in short authoritative comments ie should i see this my expectation from trailers was this is going to be so over the top that is will be not only bad but down right awful not so bad its good type awful i expected it to be up there with the fast and the furious in that it would just be dumb and of no valueafter seeing this i was pleasantly surprised much of the story downplays the terrible premises of whatifphysicswasnttrue and focuses more on a fight club style change of your basic lifestyle at least in the first 23overall it has a solid plot and surprisingly doesnt over do it to a flaw although you must of course suspend disbelief to have a good time watching itthe biggest flaw is as usual the ending its as if the writers gave up by the time they got to hour 11 dont want to give anything away so i will just say dont spend 8 plus popcorn and drinks but its worth 5 total if you are one to wait til its on hbo its definitely worth your 2 hours,fantasy
centers around wesley gibson a complete and total loser who one day discovers that his father was a notorious assassin and that he must follow in his footsteps in order to track down his killeris the type of movie that you can only enjoy if you completely forget about the concepts of reality and physics it is completely over the top and unrealistic but it is also extremely entertaining if you can get over that then you will enjoy this movie a lot the action sequences were incredible and will leave you on the edge of your seat the plot however does contain a few clichs and predictable twists and some of the drama does also come off as a bit cheesy normally this would make me give it a lower rating if it werent for the sheer awesomeness of the action scenes the acting was overall pretty solid nothing exceptional but pretty goodoverall succeeded in being very entertaining and although the plot contained a few holes and clichs it was pretty solid i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys action movies however a note to parents is very violent and packed with swearing i would not recommend it to younger kids,fantasy
at its peak in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s the action movie genre provided cinemagoers perhaps for the first time since the golden age of cinema with a broad encompassing entertainment package that was impossible to resist bigname movie stars laughs thrills and excitement all wrapped up in an easily digestible package that doesnt require too much work to unwrap not that easy accessibility is a bad thing especially during those times when despite the audiences readiness to consume filmmakers would still give it their all and each film was a labour of lovein recent years though with the novelty of the superhero movie increasing tenfold in popularity the moviegoing audience was provided with a new easily consumable source for their excitement and entertainment which promised fantasy and sciencefiction along with majestic action setpieces and the traditional actionthriller genre was reduced to shallow bland fare such as xxx mission impossible iii or bad company with a few beacons of light such as the bourne trilogy serving as anomalous but muchwelcomed exceptions now with we finally get a clearcut actionthriller that truly sincerely straightforwardly delivers everything we the viewing audience expect and call for to be entertainedthe plot itself is really quite ridiculous but naturally it doesnt really matter the thing is grabs you right from the getgo and doesnt really let loose right through the end credits the action scenes  and they are plentiful  are so incredibly wellconceived wellexecuted and wellchoreographed that one tends to easily ignore the rather silly plot devices employed to set up said action scenes car chases handtohand combat intense gun fights the film has it all and every scene employs incredibly skillful craftwork in terms of choreography stunt work cinematography editing and visual effects of which there are many and which are impressively seamlessly integrated into the scenes actionoriented or otherwise the haywire cinematography and heavily rockoriented soundtrack also contribute to the nonstop adrenaline rush of the moviethe strong cast also undeniably contributes to the film working so well angelina jolie is majestic and ascendant as the mentor and proves once again that shes quite a sufficient action star combining grace and ferocity in her performance morgan freeman is regal as the wise overseer but also gets to prove that he has a tougher rougher side but the most impressive turn is provided by james mcavoy who between the last king of scotland atonement and now has proved that he is a truly talented leading man and its not just his spoton american accent mcavoy supplies another one of the major reasons why the film works he provides us with a believable downtoearth character we can totally identify with so just as he is in awe being pulled in to this new intense highoctane new world of conspiracies car chases and lots of killing we the audience are right along side with himultimately the great actionthrillers of years past like die hard or lethal weapon worked so well primarily based on that strong human connection with the lead characters the action movies of recent years besides being quite generic and bland in terms of their plot and execution featuring bythenumbers cinematography and the same stunts and action scenes weve already seen are subpar primarily because they lack truly downtoearth characters we can genuinely identify with also the film is so relentless in its overthetop intensity wild cinematography and haywire action scenes i was so engaged in it that i didnt even feel the need to use my brain even once so sure doesnt have much of a brain nor much of a heart but it delivers sheer pure entertainment in its most absolute heartpumping seatgrabbing eyepopping form,fantasy
folks if you are a squeamish movie watcher forget this one this movie is very fast paced there are no dull moments there is no sex there is just nonstop action this movie is what i dubbed a long time ago as a st kicker the stars were all very good except for morgan freeman i thought that his character was weak  could have been played by anyone this is not the first time that i have seen morgan freeman play weak partsthe plot twists to the point where there is a double plot but it takes awhile to find this out please dont bother watching this movie if you are the type of person who likes to do other things while watching a movie you will miss most of the plots this movie deserves its r rating but not for sex or drugs or cursing,fantasy
i always wondered how hard it might be for someone to create a movie you should come up with an original idea than develop it and so onbut it seems that the writers never had such thoughts what do you need for a good movie lots what do you need for a goodselling movie hmm this one seems easierin fact the writers invented the magic bullets and sewing machines the rest was taken from batman begins and the matrix some humor from shoot em up and voil no wait still not enough you cannot do something like an old great movie and call it great too this is the moment when you call on angelina and morganill stop pretending to be a critic whats wrong are nowadays movies only for making profits yes i agree the director did a great job so did the actors and the designers but remember great movies create great actors in order for great actors to create another great moviesand this movie is not the case it left me quite disappointed and made me feel like watching the classics again9 out of 10 for actors and crew 3 out of 10 for originality and creativity 7 out of 10 overall,fantasy

fox want to train wesley to replace not only his father but also to exact revenge and kill the evil crossagain nothing about is remotely believable some movies contain the illusion of credibility but throws all restraint to the wind and bekmambetov orchestrates one ridiculous stunt after another until the movie runs out of suspense and thrives simply on whiteknuckled thrills and computergenerated stunts the acting is solid enough with mcavoy turning in a charismatic performance as a loser who becomes a hero angelina jolie surpasses anything that she did in her two tomb raider movies and mr  mrs smith things get really outlandish for her when she sprawls out on the hood of a car careening through traffic so that she can get a clear shot at cross in the stepvan pursuing them morgan freeman does what he does better than anybody else he explains half of the plot according to him the fraternity is an ageold organization of weavers that take their orders from the loom of fate they scrutinize the way that the loom weaves threads and decipher who must die for the preservation of societylike most summer movies the best way to enjoy is to forget the way that it fragrantly and repeatedly violates the laws of gravity wesley our hero has a knack for literally slinging bullets around objects to hit his intended victim in short he slings his gun arm as if he were hurling a bowling ball through the air and he can hit a target that is hidden from his eyes the computergenerated graphics of the villains baroquelooking bullet that separates in phases like a booster powered missile and perforates a mans forehead looks truly awesome has one of those lastminute reversals that will catch you totally off guard and blow your mind perhaps the closest thing to is a 1969 melodrama called the assassination bureau with diana rigg and oliver reed,fantasy
i like action movies especially ones where the story isnt held captive to the special effects i really want to tell you that is a masterpiece on film i want to tell you that the story is engaging welltold and surprising i want to tell you that this is a great moviebut i canti have my reasons its not the acting james mcavoy is terrific angelina jolie was really good and morgan freeman can do no wrong the story has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing but it never had me wondering what i just missed and the action scenes are top notchits not that this isnt a good movie its a very good movie but im afraid that the extreme violence depicted  the graphic gory and explicit shots of people bleeding getting shot and stabbed and blown up  well it was all a bit much for meif you can handle this type of thing then by all means please go see this movie but if you dont like blood and guts then    well wait for it to be shown on tbs in a few years i just wish the filmmakers hadnt put us in this predicament i dont think they needed to,fantasy
i absolutely love angelina and james as actors while this movie was ok it was not the stellar beginning of summer movie punch that i anticipated it to be sure theres lots of action with good special effects though i personally believe it couldve been better but maybe with so much effects infused into one movie they had to settle for allaround pretty good special effects throughout rather than amazing inspiring special effects throughout but theres also i believe a lot of unwarranted vulgarity in terms of profanity sexual content and pointblank shooting dont get me wrong but i thought this would be a more intelligent movie as in planning how to assassinate elusive people and implementing intricate car chase scenes but instead it was all sheer brute and power physical pointblank guns and knives and fist combat i suppose i was also let down because i also thought there would be a strong story the story was just as much as you can expect from any other mediocre action flick these days though nothing really special there are a few twists but they werent good enough to redeem the movie as a whole i believe the first problem with the movie is that not much is done to help the audience identify with james character in the beginningrather than evoking sympathy and seeing true transformation in his character he is transformed in a superficial twisted way kind of like rather than helping someone with body image or confidence issues realize they are beautiful and do deserve respect because beautiful is not only how the media portrays people you instead feed into the dissonance by giving them a whole makeover and saying see now you are a beautiful person worthy of feeling beautiful its just a little unnerving,fantasy
before this movie i really didnt know this relatively new guy james mcavoy a scottish actor who apparently had been in the first narnia movie for the other castmates sure who doesnt know angelina jolie and morgan freemans great in this flick as well but its this unassuming dude that does so well as the stressedout accounting manager turned cold blooded assassin the transition was quite believable from this geek of a person with anxiety attacks to an efficient assassin with a special ability thats quite rare mcavoy jolie and freeman certainly make for a great cast in this actionpacked thrillerif you thought jumper was an interesting concept like i did earlier this 2008 dont get me wrong jumper was decent but nothing great or its a dvd worth collecting thatll get blown out of the water with a movie about this group or secret society of assassins that have been in existence for hundreds of years the curving bullets the action scenes the twist of the story the fast pace wonderfully done directingyou just gotta want to see this movie and angelinas rear is a bonus for you gents out there while it holds no philosophical significance nor handtohand combat like say the matrixs simply a kick ass action flick thats enjoyable,fantasy
wesley gibson is the guy everyone can relate to he hates his job his girlfriend is unfaithful his best friend has betrayed him and life in general just seems like a big waste of time little does he know that his long lost father was one of the worlds deadliest assassins that is until his latest assignment cost him his life wesley is recruited by a mysterious fraternity to become his fathers successor but in order to do so hes going to have to endure hell loud ugly and incoherent this one is sure please action fans with its flashy matrixlike action scenes unrelenting pace and abundance of brutal violence but at the end of the day its hard to root foror careabout any of these characters ,fantasy
this movie is so bad dreadful just dreadful the laws of physics need not apply assassins who can kill a person from over a mile away with one shot but cant hit a target standing 20 feet in front of them bullets that can fly around corners life is to shot to waste it on this visual diarrhoea,fantasy
is one of those movies i was kinda hoping would be a little better with the passage of time and after eight years thats a resounding no there were a lot of things that were awful about this movie back in that theater seat in 08 but one thing that really bothered me was the storys beatforbeat ripoff of the matrix mcavoys reconditioning is more violent than neos but its all there regardless its pretty blatantthe movie is pretty hard to stomach even having been reared on a diet of shallow action movies curve the bullet has gotta be one of the stupidest things ive ever heard and the movie gives no good reason to accept it cmon if youre going to steal bullettime at least give me something to go on dont just shoot physics the birdbut even today is a rotten reminder of how bad action movies could be in the 2000s its got that tweaked style that feels more like a bludgeon than a thrill and a garish look to really seal the deal to trot out the matrix comparison one more time its got none of that films artistic sensibilities which wouldve helped this go down so much easier310,fantasy
i want my life back the time i spent trying to watch this complete piece of trash is gone i am dumber for watching it the acting is worse than the worst of nick gage seriously i thought django unchained was bad by comparison its gone with the wind whoever produced and released this ought to go to prisonif you have any education above the 5th grade you will find this sucker to be welllets put it this way to see a movie you need to be able to suspend your disbelief with this movie you need more suspension than the golden gate bridge so if you are forced to watch this movie you may as well accept the fact that you are a hostage to bad cinema and even worse entertainmentthere isnt enough alcohol on the planet to make this turkey fly,fantasy
todays comic book movies are supposed to be gritty and dark but theres a difference between that and this particular film the film is about a young man wesley james mcavoy who is going through a midlife crisis and cant figure out what his purpose is in life that is until he runs into a woman named fox angelina jolie who brings him into a secret society of assassins called the fraternity just to point out by the way that the fraternity is the lamest name of a group i have ever heard why not just call it the group to be even less specificwhat i could not believe right off the bat was how low the vocabulary level was for this film what were the scriptwriters doingpretending they were teenagers again practically every sentence drops the fbomb how does this enhance the film any yes sometimes the fbomb is dropped but not every sentence thats just being crass every character in this film has no dignity whatsoevernot even the main characters boss then we have the issue of characterization james mcavoys acting is offensive and insulting to all actors in hollywood what appealed to him in the script the fact that he got the chance to curse his mouth off yeah real professional oh and he also says im sorry way too often and makes a lot of distorted faces which makes me hate him that much more not to mention for the first half of the film hes a crying sack of crap just like shia labeouf from transformers 2007 either grow up or go home mcavoyeven angelina jolies character was weird sure jolies always sexy but supposedly she based her character off of clint eastwood so tell me where any of the scenes she played in resembled that i didnt see one plus the laws of physics really dont seem to apply in this film i can see maybe someone curving a bullet path but jumping off a building onto another building 500 yards away and make it with no injuries these are assassins not superheroes mark millar and jg jones i think have too many screws loose in their deranged headsoh lets not forget the special effects theres plenty slow motion if youre into that kind of stuff that is unless you dont like seeing it every 5 minutes in every scene seriously folks slow motion is good when its time for the audience to focus on something and this kind of event rarely occurs it doesnt occur that often here either but for some reason the filming crew felt it was necessary for every cotton picking sceneas for action goes theres plenty of bloody gunshots not that that really made the viewing experience anymore exciting it felt more numbing than it did entertaining there was actually one point where two people were having a gunfight but it wasnt going anywhere because they were trained so well that their shots kept clashing how dull why dont you shoot twice idiots even danny elfmans score provided little propulsion in this film it wasnt engaging and it was thrilling thumbs down elfman and then to top it off with the greatest insult to all at the end of the film james mcavoy has the guts to ask the audience what the f have you done lately i tell you what mr mcavoy ive wasted two hours of my time watching you play the most annoying character i have ever seen on screeni had this film to be cool but in the end i to beat the hell out of my tv screen timur bekmambetovs film is the perfect example of what film trash really is it needs to be buried in the earths core,fantasy
the most hindi movie ever made even bollywood couldnt afford such bollywood stuff maybe morgan freeman needed some money otherwise it wasnt his place in such movies to challenge his reputation but for the rest of the staff they are average enough to form such thing for gibson and fox there wasnt enough signs of love between them but gibson could use some of it to curve the bullet for the first time lol just the idea of shooting from far was the bright point in this movie and the rest of the film was set around this ideathey had the idea for bullet curve and then they built a film around it gibson becomes brainwashed enough to should someone who grabsaves him at the siteand the film ends like a silly jokesending ratsas i said a hindi movie with a little taste for japkorean anime,fantasy
well how can a person who adopts children jolie fall as low as to star in a movie advocating mindless violence as a way to take control of your life the message of the movie is all you people are pathetic you need to take control of your life like i did aka by slaughtering those i dont like excuse me if it were a comic book i would not necessarily care as much but a lot of actors in the movie are looked up to by younger people and what kind of values and moral lessons are they getting from this movieoh and then when these kids after watching a couple of movies like start beating up others of course because they are likely to model the behaviour they saw etc we put them in jail people stop being gullible and start thinking about what you are shown,fantasy
part matrix part csi part xena warrior princess and part what the hell were they thinking nice cast angelina gorgeous as usual morgan commanding and meaning businessthe plot son of assassin is sought out by special blah de blah opps because of possible special genetic assassin abilityoodles of incoming swerving bullets usually going either through the back of the head and splattering blood everywhere or swerving right around the head at the last minute and meeting another very cool missile shaped bullet and splatting it like a pancakeanyhooolots of action but dont get your hopes up,fantasy
this is a movie that falls firmly into the category of quite not very entertaining garbage it might have had something going for it if we hadnt seen the matrix  all those years ago but what the hell put your mind on coast and sit back for a kinda fun hourandahalf youll never get back for me the inclusion of the name angelina jolie in a cast list is a nearguarantee of poor quality on the other hand morgan freeman usually has the opposite effect maybe morgan is saving up for his divorce or somebodys been stepping on his chlorpromazine but either way his presence is something of a mystery i can understand how films like this get made i just dont know why maybe its because were alone in an endless silent eternal emptiness  an emptiness we try to fill any way we can oh now i think someones been stepping on m y chlorpromazine,fantasy
frankly i dont know the book this movie is based on but what of its story made it to the screen was very thin characters were not rich andor affective but simply flat and gray non of the boringly repeated crashexplosionshootsplatter scenes changed the general flow of the movie purling down the stairs i also found no humor in it neither except may be in the ridiculous statements he is the man i was ordinary just like you are etc well may be notimagine the last part of the first matrix movie the slow motion shooting on autorepeat excl the storyline up front for 110 minutes and you have a pretty good idea of this movie its just wasting 2 hours of your life,fantasy
the previews looked good thats about it one of the main aspects of movie making or writing is you have to make the world in which the characters believable in order to sell the story well the world is our world normal world in which i type in currently and in this world that the writers and director is using because they have no creativity or artistic talent there are unexplained assassins in it these assassins as you know in the previews can shoot the wings off flies hey i gave it to them its possible even curving a bullet around target a few inches is possible then in the movie they block bullets with bullets and i was seriously about to vomit and said ill give that to them then the people who are not superhuman can all of a sudden run 66 miles per hour and leap 300 feet across buildings then i vomited lol then the end was just outrageous angeniol big lips is in a mexican stand off situation with every one in a circle and of course you can curve the bullet right so naturally the writers are high and say hey man the audience is stupid and its at the end of the movie so lets do something crazy because we suck and are over paid and guess what she shoots 14 people in the head in circle with one bullet because it can curve well i guess 45 caliber rounds can go through 14 peoples heads right if your saying its just a movie and those are just superficial action sequences and the plot has to be good then i am going to leave the plot for you to see for your self its moronic,fantasy
this is one of those kind of movies which you either like or dislike completely theres no middle way you cant just say oh well it was ok you can just say gosh thats what action is ora complete waste of time thats what is all about with raging bullets and fast sequences you will find it completely engaging when you keep your mind open or you might get angry and start wondering why are you even there sitting and watching this lame moviewesley the lost in the middle of nowhere his small home and an ever worse office and living the life of nobody or the life of a good for nothing accountantis suddenly forced to believe that he isnt who he thought he was hes one of them assassins with uncanny weapon skills and a pulsating heart with each beat of which he pumps adrenaline into his raging mind he finds out that the dad he never knew passed to him the genes which will make him a great killer and a bank balance which i wouldnt even tell you aboutyet with all the ups and downs and a special mission that hes to accomplish he will find out in the end that whatever he knew was all but a lie and his destiny is bigger than what it appeared at first,fantasy
sometimes you should never really judge a book by its cover and that can be so true for what is said about unfortunaltey even though it stars one of the most desirable women in the world and boasts about great action stunts it never really hits the action mark to the point it should do and with its matrixesquire points it thusly just makes it seem like a very silly and flawed imitation to lets say equilibrium although it does have some genuine amusing moments in it  it is just a very brainless action movie which either some people liked or loathed and unfortunately for me  i never really got into it to enjoy that much check it out it if it is on tv otherwise if you can find something better on  just check that out instead 67 out of 10 choose your destiny,fantasy
you go into a movie like this expecting to attempt to suspend beliefs as you know the movie is a fantasy the writers however forgot that you need to do some level of convincing for the audience to buy into the fantasyyou have this super secret society of assassins that can run faster and jump farther than is humanly possible these assassins can react faster than a cat they can bend the path of a bulletyou assume they are doing these things with their minds there telekinetic chi force etcno explanation is given just a mention of the giftthe worst explained nature of the movie is how this super secret society is using looms to communicate their assassination orders they actually have guys who with the aid of a magnifying glass look at the threads of a sheet of cloth to determine messages sent from god knows where on what person they are going to whackdont these guys have the internet or some drop off box more devious would be some code written in personal adds for instructionsspoiler below i do like how we have a twist in the move where we find out that the assassins target is actually his father and the person who he thought was his father was a cold hearted killerthe end of the movie was just a downer we find out the main villain was given instructions to kill some of their own and so he decided to disobey the orders coming from the loony loon and assign his own targets i mean the man had a point didnt he,fantasy
was hypedup to be one of 2008s summer blockbusters there are some satisfying action scenes in this movie but the overall aftertaste is slightly above averagea young man living a meaningless life is forced into becoming a great assassin like his father who was one of the greatest assassins to ever livethis film has some great special effects but the storyline could have used some improvement and the majority of the action scenes were ridiculous i was scoffing at this movie more than i was enjoying it angelina jolie is a pretty face used to sell movies but shes not a very convincing actress morgan freeman is one of the best actors in hollywood but his ability could not help him in this situation james mcavoy was great in the last king of scotland but was mediocreatbest in this film all of the characters were poorlydeveloped and lacked connectivitythe excessive use of violence swearing and shooting overshadows any deeper meaning that the story may have held there were some interesting twists near the end but not enough to compensate for the rest of the film being lacklustermy rating 610 stars,fantasy
to be sure this movie has tremendous parallels to the matrix the action scenes are thorough and a little too long but clearly show the work of an exceptional stunt and spec eff team there are parts of the story which should have been developed better and the writers tried to create unsuccessfully an armageddon scenariocons there is simply way too much graphic violence people die in action films but so many die in and the bullet to the head scenes are just over the top and way too frequent they also use the csi effect of travelling with the bullet through its target and out the other side gratuitous splatter included about two dozen times there is also a lot of nonfatal violence which adds to the story but also gets excessive lots and lots of lacerations with good and chilling knifelike sound effectsthen there is the fword this film has no deficiency of f and mf its just too much here and there ok that will work but it seems like the writers had a love affair with howard stern and it found its way in to the movieif you like angelina jolie youll enjoy the brief view of her semiclothed back side she plays the same kind of tough but sophisticated chick as in the one she did with pitt a few years backi characterize the movie as matrix meets fight club its dark twisted and violent with good guys vs bad guys the climactic twist like fight club caught me by surprise and i thought it was very smartly inserted,fantasy
my quick opinion decent script acting way better than anyone would expect from an action movie especially from mcavoy showing proper leading man chops perfect casting and beautifully staged and inventive setpieces it still is just a piece of light summer entertainment but well thought ending gives it nice emotional overtones and leaves you with a good impression timur bekmabetov once again shows that he is the director to watch with uncanny eye for breathtaking visuals all and all if you like action movies this one is one of the best since the matrix plus angelina jolie playing a sexy assassin and morgan freeman dropping fbombs and being badass priceless watch it and enjoy the ride,fantasy
i dont usually go to see rrated movies i find the abuse of language and the usually inappropriateunnecessary sexuality used exclusively for titillation purposes an insult to my intelligencebut i like james mcavoy and figured i could endure the annoying bits given that it looked like a fascinating story lineof course i am occasionally wrong very very wrongfirst what worked  james mcavoy this guy is awesome subtle realistic strong he was stunningthe stunts mostly awesome  the car stunts in particular i actually yelled cool at one point taken by delighted surprise at some particularly visually artistic componentthe visuals  mostly good  a few that required me to close my eyes  bullets boring through the forehead not my cup of teawhat was wrong hi im your willing suspension of disbelief and im going to be sent to the outer solar system for the duration of this filmpuhlease i am willing to suspend my disbelief for some things cant watch anything w the hulk cuz it drives me nuts his pants dont rip right off of him but this was beyond suspension of disbelief  this required cryogenic freezing of willing disbeliefstory line  it was horrendous idiotic there was so much that could have been done with it  but the characters operated beyond what i thought should be realistic responses the whole thing in that capacity was a cheat imho the characters couldashoulda responded a certain way to certain events  and they didnt when they find out about the betrayals they do not respond  they just keep plowing forward when all that they believe is challenged they just kind of shrug and say oh well onward and upward sorry  if wesley had just found out about all this and suddenly had his whole life history handed to him on a platter and then finds out these people have been lying to him and he just goes blithely on not questioning not wondering not challenging what hes seeing or being told sorry do not cannot believe his character would act that waythat burned it for me there was the straw of disbelief that broke this camels back it ruined the movie for methere was so much that could have been done w the script  but instead they went for pure action and wow factor and treated the audience like they were nothing more than idiot adolescentsbut maybe that is what they were going for,fantasy
is a good action flickstylishfast and having its own dose of twists and turnshowever it would be unwise to compare this movie to a cult classic like matrixthe story does not have enough meat the plot is having many a loophole but james mcavoy does a decent job in carrying his role through angelina jolies character fox is much more believable as an assassin than mcavoys wesley but probably this was how it was meant to beeven when mcavoy goes through a complete transformation to a super killer from a doormat nobody he does not really look tough enough for his part though he makes up with his acting skills the action shots are innovativeyou would have seen similar stuff before but you can find a different stylized version herethe camera work is very good and the slowmo effects does not sap the pace of the fighting sequencesthat is a job truly well donethe story never reaches anywhere near the sublime dimensions of matrixso for a overall rating 610angelina looks sexy but thinnerif you do not like action no point in walking into the theatre just to check her out,fantasy
this is a difficult movie to review its based on a comic of the same name if you liked the comic then you can forget the movie the movie shares almost nothing in common with the book only the title the fraternity fox wesley and the initial opening of the comic are in tact oh and even though the names are there the characters are nothing like the comic book counterparts its like making spiderman only he wears no costume and doesnt have spider powers fox in the comic ajs character looks pretty cool and wears an orange costume similar to catwoman but she is africanamerican with short hair now aj in my opinion is a good actress and i think shes pretty attractive but she looks nothing like the comic book foxso if you read any reviews on imdb that say this movie sucks because its not like the source material then you can believe them however for this reviewer having read the comic i am glad for that reason the comic book was about scumbags who rape murder kill and swear as if it was a day job the ending of the book goes so far as to insult the reader and thus serving no purpose in the story other than to say that guys like the people who post on this site are stupid and meaningless now the point of the comic may be to get us off our butts and do something with our lives and that is a good point to make i am a writer and make my own movies im sure a lot of you guys are too and like you all i try to make what i can and maybe something will happen in the future i dont think my day job just as crappy as the one in the movie should judge who i am as a person now that i got that off my chest on to the movieif you accept the movie on its own terms you will enjoy it bending bullets jumping off buildings etc are all fine i like fake action movies they are entertaining and serve their purpose the main complaint about this movie is the how the targets are chosen but it doesnt really matter because how do you judge who lives and who dies the fact is is that fox believes in their theory of fate choosing and believes in it so much that she makes a powerful decision in the end of the filmif that ending didnt occur you could throw out the entire film because the characters didnt buy it so why should i but because aj makes the choice she proves she does believe her version of fate so the audience has to at least understand why she did what she did saying things like i dont believe this could happen etc etc is just foolishits a movie movies are fake but the should serve one of two purposes 1  to entertain us from our crappy jobs where we cant tell the boss to foff cause we have to support our families or 2  to make us think about our lives religion society history our place in the universe etc entertained me and for a few moments i did think about my crappy job and thought maybe i could do something better and still support my familysince wesley is the protagonist we identify with him and want him to succeed some say the movie is predictable well name me one action movie thats not now dont email me telling which movies are not i own 1900 dvds original ones not burned and i know every action movie out there but to say its predictable is to say that i knew batman would win in the end like come on thats what genre pictures do the deliver a formula which is sure to please and the better ones like this movie throw a bit of thought and excitement in too give it a chance,fantasy
i dont want to get to much in depth about the flick so ill just keep it as short and precise as possible if you are into the actionthriller genre then this is a flick you must watch the reasoning behind the way the assassins are developed is original and the camera effects are sublime i must give accolades to the director responsible for the taking of those fantastic action scenesi read some of the comments above where people trashed this movie i cant possible imagine how this movie can be trashed by anyone who appreciated flicks such as the matrix equilibrium etc the tag line at the end was definitely a catchy one which made us rewind the explanation at the end of the movie some 34 times the plot was also pretty decent but bear in mind that it is in the actionthriller genre with more emphasis based on the actionoverall it was a great flick and id actually watch it again watch it and be your own judge810,fantasy
is solid big screen entertainment with a lot of bang for your buck from the impressively violent skyscraper opening to the bullet strewn end this is a great escapist action movie from night watch director timur bekmambetovjames mcavoy is excellent as office worker turned assassin guided by the very beautiful angelina jolie mcavoys transition in the film is convincing but a healthy suspension of disbelief is required for this comic book tale disengage brain and enjoyi was pleased to see marc hustle warren on the big screen his creepy portrayal of the thoroughly unpleasant repairman is a joy to watchthe explosive set pieces are rather wonderful to behold particularly the perilous sequence on a trainreminiscent of the bullet time scenes from the matrix the special effects are first class theres enough of the red stuff to guarantee this being a film pitched at adults while the fight clubstyle narration will appeal to all those suffering the mindnumbing tedium of the rat raceunsurprisingly a sequel is already in the works it will be interesting to see what direction the followup takes as this is what id call a complete moviethe film differs vastly from the supervillains premise of millars original comic books but is a more hollywood and budgetfriendly project8 out of 10 proper popcorn entertainment with dollops of style which may well improve on a second viewing im actually looking forward to watching this bad boy again,fantasy
a fraternity of assassinsthe assassin thing is just worn out however most everyone one passes on the street at the water cooler in the gymn etc all have issues dont even say nice day huh even in passing lest they snap on you this is what makes the assassinescapee from the cubicle characters so appealing one can live hisher deepest darkest fantasy vicariously by watching this movie poor angelina she is just a tan tattooed bagobones the gettingoutoftherejuvapoolnaked scene why does she do these things to herself dont get me wrongi consider her a great actor a wonderful humanitarian appropriately eccentric like most great artists are and probably just a great gal to simply hang out and drink beer with unless she tries to involve you in some of her cutting games i would decline on armwrestling her for fear of breaking her arm it seems that she is trying to obscure her beauty with the tats as if she is trying to force people to see her as a person not as just a pretty facebody megan fox of transformers fame likely idolizes her could it also be that having witnessed the utter squalor too many people around the world must live in including starvation she chooses to starve herself because 1 she is ashamed to be all healthy and privileged around those who are obviously not 2 she wants to cultivate an appearance which allows her to more easily walk amongst them or 3 both this is not to bash angelina im actually concerned for her brad and their little diversigarten seemed so formulaic to me echoes of bruce waynes first encounter with the league of shadows perhaps in its simply renamed the fraternity hitman jason bournedo we really need any more assassins spoiler alert when fox takes her final shot which offs the ring of assassins considering how fast such a bullet would travel how does she manage to return her head to an upright position so fast before the bullet comes full circle to pierce her own temple this way jolie wont have to do a sequel hey shes a busy lady however i would have liked to have seen her in a sequel with mcavoy regardless that as of now kids all over the world are sneaking their mommy or daddys 45 cal out behind the house to try the bulletslingin trick on their friends creeeepy,fantasy
to start off i just want to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the ideas used in this film were very creative and visionarythe action in this movie is fastpaced and keeps your eyes glued to the screen as i said before the ideas and the way it was directed is so creative and unique i hope to see more stuff from timur bekmambetov in the future i especially enjoyed the scene close to the beginning of the movie where it shows the guy on the rooftop who gets shot with the sniper from an insane distance it was cool because it basically went back in time and showed you where the bullet came from and shows the bullet shedding its casing i thought it was very cool the way they did itjames mcavoy was the perfect leading role for the film he sold his role very well morgan freeman was very good as always as the leader of the fraternity he almost reminded me of morpheus from the matrix angelina jolie was good in her role as fox although she wasnt in the film too muchoverall i thought this a very entertaining movie and worth going to see on a friday night with some of your friends,fantasy
i personally feel that the movie starts with the necessary ingredients to keep a man interested for at least half an hour sex violence and a little bit of dark humour this is just enough time for the movie to form a plot the initial ingredients continue to run throughout even after the introduction of the faternity once the movie kicks in it starts to become real gripping some excellent acting action and music help bring the story along nicely thanks to a great performance from james mcavoy its the type of movie where you want to be the lead man at the end of it plus its better the second time you watch it and its just not jampacked with bs which is what i expected  it has a point a fantastic movie,fantasy
this has to be the worst movie i have ever seen the assault on the intelligence of the american public with this movie would even surprise bill maher show people getting their head blown off blow stuff up tell your boss off in front of the office and america will love it in addition use your influence in the entertainment industry to get people to call it great the woman picked this up because she heard it got won all kinds of awards sadly she will have to go to the grave knowing she was the person who brought the brain rot into our home move on watch any movie before you watch this awful bloated badly written mess,fantasy
2008  12 out of 4 james mcavoy plays a common man who has a girlfriend cheating on him while hes at work with a boss his hates one day he gets swept up into a league of assassins and learns that he must avenge the murder of his father this is the type of action movie that not only asks for you to turn you brain off but also asks that you rip it out shred it up and then eat it down just for entertainment this movie doesnt contain a single shot that doesnt have some sort of cgi going on which to me is a major drag but at the same time you have to give the film credit for its imagination which is on overdrive from the opening scene to the closing credits the plot of this film really isnt all that important although you could call it a dumbed down male version of le femme nikita the reason people are going to jump at this film is for its action sequences which are all very entertaining as soon as you learn not to take them very seriously if you take the movie too serious youre going to wonder how in the first chase sequence the fastest car in the world cant out run an assassin driving a beat up truck which probably couldnt hit more than sixtyfive miles per hour the other action scenes including killing someone from a ltrain a train falling off a bridge plus countless other explosions with some including rats all of these scenes will keep you entertained but for my money they arent great scenes since all of them are faked with cgi give me the french connection or any buster keaton film for real action for a video game the stuff here is good but i could never call them among the greatest ever made the performances are better than youd expect from a popcorn film with mcavoy once again impressing me very much he perfectly captures his characters weakness early in the film and is believable as the trained killer morgan freeman is pretty much wasted as the leader of the cult and angelina jolie at least looks good in her brief nude scene,fantasy
night watch and day watchdirector timur bekmambetovs previous movieswere two films where the style was endorsed by substance  in other wordsthey were something more than pure visual spectaclebutnowis only pure style with zero substancethis movie is only worried on showing cool action scenes with a lot of visual effects but nothing elseso the experience this movie brings is insipid and boringthis film is not cared on character development or in endorsing the visual spectacle with a good storyas a contrast of this moviei can mention shoot em up whichin spite of not being great or completely satisfactoryused the visual spectacle with the porpoise of making a satire of the action moviesso the experience was entertaininginthere is no porpoise for the visual spectacle sothe film easily boresi also wanna add that the story from this movie was absurd and overusedthe only element which moderately saves this weak film is the performancesjames mcavoy and angelina jolie show conviction on their characters and the always brilliant morgan freeman shows a lot of energy and enthusiasmthis actor shows energy even on the poorest films and he is one of the few saving graces inif it was not for himthis movie would have received a 4 as a rating and not a 5in summaryis a very poor movie which commits a fatal mistake  being boringmy recommendation is to skip this movie,fantasy
i think indiana jones 4 was the biggest rip off this year and strangely i found most criticism made to that movie is similar to and they are honestly true most action scenes in are just out of reality however what i could not swallow for indiana jones i did it totally for i think it is because of the atmosphere which is one of the most stylish i have seen this year the world and the visual are so fluid and cool i just swam into it from the absolute beginning the coldness and the very little dialog of most support character including fox angelina jolie reinforces this feeling and what at direction many beautiful scenes magnificently filmed this director has lots of potentialmy only criticism would against angelina jolie she has a great role in this movie but she looks too anorexicvoila is a great pop corn movie for this summer they even made the effort to have a good plot bravo,fantasy
up until the last 3 minutes i thought director timur bekmambetovs was the coolest movie ever made the campy dialogue at its conclusion does the movie in in context this is surprising is completely over the top orchestrated chaos and violence and classy camp is just part of the deal ultimately the script douses the movies innate genius and style is blatantly reminiscent of the matrix writers michael brandt derek haas and chris morgan wrote their screenplay based on the graphic novel by mark millar and jg jones unlike the cyber reality of the matrix invents the mythology of the 1000 year old fraternityprolific assassins the fraternity terminates designated targets and maintains the balance of good and evil in the world theirs is a dark world of order and secrecy members of the fraternity have the distinct inherited ability to control the adrenaline in their bodies consequently they can seemingly summon great physical strength speed agility and reflexes at will as part of their zenlike training they can curve the trajectory of bullets they are the ultimate assassins angelina jolie is amazing and so darkly charismatic as fox the fraternitys elite assassin james mcavoy captures the emerging hero wesley who is so disgusted with his ordinary lifecurved accelerating bullets high speed automatic weapons blazing from a red viper and the cataclysmic derailing train during assassination attempt characterize the bold and maverick style of bekmambetovs most of the narrative shortcomings are diluted by the directors blinding pacemostlymcavoy plays wesley a panic suffering account manager working for tyrannical morbidly obese office manager janice greatly evil lorna scott wesley is hooked on anxiety medication enduring his venomous girlfriend cathy pretty kristen hager wesleys coworker barry comically dense chris pratt is having sex with cathy which wesley also knows one day while wesley is refilling anxiety medication prescription he encounters strikingly beautiful fox jolie fox tells wesley that his father perhaps the greatest assassin who ever lived was killed the day before wesley had thought his father had died soon after he was born what ensues is spectacularly orchestrated carnage and mayhem with fox wesley and apparently the man who killed wesleys fathercross silently charismatic thomas kretschmann what also follows is one of the most amazing car chases in moviesfox brings wesley to fraternity leader sloan ultra cool morgan freeman sloan demonstrates to wesley his legacy and innate gifts he invites him to take control of your own destiny and join the fraternity after predictable soul searching wesley chooses to join the fraternity fox is charged with transforming wimpy wesley into the next great master assassin wesley endures unbelievable physical beatings and training toward one endavenging his fathers murder here angelina jolie emerges as a powerful force jolies fox has an air of quiet gravitas and profound sadness in a great moment she recounts her tragic past and then tells wesley kill one maybe save a thousand james mcavoy plays the lead hero wesley but it is really angelina jolies enigmatic presence that resonates throughout mcavoy brilliantly captures the angst and thrill of the young man reconciling his great powers freeman leverages his regal and calculated persona as sloan jolie embodies a samurai soul that serves as fox she is strong vulnerable and all about honor jolie is perhaps the most stunningly beautiful woman on the motion picture screen she is a compelling actor who performs all the action with pathos and lancould have been one of the coolest movies of all time had the story followed through and eased up a bit on the camp that being said is a brilliant wild ride with killer performances from angelina jolie and james mcavoy hold on to your seats,fantasy
first let me state that im all for the implausiblebutfun movie genre transporter 1  2 are good examples of films of this genre that work they were fun to watch and they didnt try to hard to sell the completely implausible plots and physically impossible action sequences who carestheyre fun to watch not so with first of all the implausibility level rises past implausible and crashes right through ridiculous and into timewastingly bizarre territory whats worse stupid dialog and overobvious camera shots try too hard at every turn to sell what cant be sold doesnt the director get it we dont want to be soldwell go with your plot if you just deliver the actionit starts in a promising way with some office space references wesley a hapless office drone is henpecked by his annoying overweight female boss who looks quite like the looks like youve got a case of the mondays lady his cubemate is taking a lot of time off for dentist appointments to screw weselys girlfriend then one day hes saved by angelina jolie from what she says is an assassination attempt on him ok we can go with thatuntil she further explains that the attempt was by a rogue member of an assassination fraternity of which his estranged father was the top member this fraternity apparently exists only to do battle with another assassination fraternity how they get paid is unknown but they seem to have unlimited funds they also carry out assassinations to preserve order but it looks a lot more like these two fraternities just run around killing each otherthe orders for whom to kill are delivered by a bizarre encryption method consisting of slight imperfections embedded into weaving patterns made by an ancient loom in their frontbusinessa textile mill near what looks like goose island in chicago they could have just said a secret mr x tells them who to kill but i digress i wouldve bought the weavingcode thing if they hadnt spent so much time trying to explain it againwith movies like this they should just let it go and get on with the actiondont bore us with trying to explain how if the vertical thread misses the weave and goes over the cross thread its a zero and if the horizontal thread goes under the cross thread its a 1 or some such nonsense i wouldve bought the stupid plotpoint but it was oversold just get on with the actioni could go on and on with the bizarre initiation process where hes beaten up daily by the repairman then covered in krispykreme glaze to accelerate the healing he learns how to curve a bullet so he can shoot around obstacles thats where i almost fell asleep too much time spent on selling us on how he has to go through all of this to prepare himself to do this ultrahighpriority kill and of course there are  ridiculous twists upon twists where everyone he thought was bad was actually good and vice versa or were they oh who cares it was a waste of timeif the movie had just spent a bit more time with some better action sequences then it mightve risen to the level of entertainment but i felt it was extremely overwrought and and downright boring at times,fantasy
was pretty cool they grab some guns and do crazy jumps and just shoot like a hundred people in the face and do flips in cars and stuff go watch itmorgan freeman says now shoot this mother fer and it is pretty hilariousjames mcavoy has to endure about a hundred slow motion close ups of his face in incredibly unflattering poses that must have sucked when he went to the premieretheres some pretty cool scenes where james mcavoys girlfriend has sex,fantasy
the trailers for show how this will be a visceral treat above all else hopefully containing a great story too but not necessarily needing one there is definitely more story than youd expect from the high action quick cut trailer and the performances help keep it grounded in some sense of reality despite the otherworldly things done by them eyecandy for sure the end result does manage to be more than just the effects infusing a lot of humor into the action culminating into a very entertaining experiencethe opening sequences definitely setup what will be expected for the duration a very stylistically shot film we are treated to an introduction of wesley gibson our hero at an office party complete with voiceover narration changing film speeds and cuts to events he is thinking of to help illustrate the mental state of ambivalence and docility he has slowly built up to numb himself to the world around him juxtaposed with this banal cubicle life comes a battle scene atop a couple skyscrapers downtown we have an assassin on the trail of a rogue member of the fraternity a group of killers with the ability to hone a massive amount of adrenaline to slow down time and enhance their actions to superhuman levels looking to identify the bullet being used to out his partners the fight sprawls into a shootout featuring an impossible leap over a city block through the air window to window in order to murder the men across the way also shooting at him these men were only decoys however as the rogue agent watches it all and finishes the job from miles away this event begins the search for young wesley the son of a fraternity elite unknowing of the lion that dwells inside of his beatdown suburbanite faade a force that will soon come out to play as he discovers his power and a bloodlust for the man that killed his fatherwesley slowly becomes a lethal machine honing his adrenaline rushes for super sensory ability the power to bend a bullet through space and educating himself on the thousand year history of his new brotherhood learning everything he needs to know to be the best assassin he can be a guild of weavers to begin this troupe still keeps up the work in a textile factory using the machinery as tools of training and also as the way to discover who is next on the list to kill fate and faith brings the names out through a secret code in the fabric of a giant loom spelling out who must die next the world itself deems who is to be taken a power we cant understand or question makes the decisions because one dead might mean a hundred can continue living training with knives guns and fists getting the crap beat out of him until his mind is clear to answer even the simplest questions with complete honesty and bathing in a concoction of a waxy stimulant that speeds up the healing process by increasing white blood cell count wesley quickly becomes the professional he needs to be to take out cross the rogue agent that the group says killed his father gibson is the only man for the job and the fabric has spoken that cross life must be endedthe mythology is very involved and i believe well explained we learn about the history of the fraternity what they do and why while also getting a feel for the members and where they all come from helped immensely by the brilliant special effects the sequences arent so much unbelievable as they are just plain slick and cool the world bekmambetov has transported us to is such a heightened reality that you begin to accept what occurs for the simple fact that it does curving bullets through space driving cars to flip over another so as to shoot through the sunroof shooting guns from miles away and hitting the target and leaping through glass as it slowly shatters are definite feats to behold one thing this film cannot be faulted for is the flair for which it all happensto enhance that style is a very prevalent sardonic wit james mcavoy whos american accented whine isnt as bad as i feared is perfectly cast as the lemming breaking free from the constraints he has built around his life the humor comes through his words and actions bordering on overkill the keys spelling out profanities as he slams a keyboard into another characters face but never becoming out of place the aesthetic is set up early and therefore stays faithful throughout complete with a wellrounded supporting castkonstantin khabensky having fun with the director that cast him as the star of his russian vampire saga terence stamp solid as always in a small role angelina jolie just plain having fun on screen and morgan freeman doing what he does best while also awkwardly yelling out profanities for some reason a surreal event hits the mark and thomas kretschmann as cross the man being hunted down is great there is more to his role than one would initially anticipate and he handles the dramatic needs of the part in concert with the action fightsthe films story takes some very interesting twists and turns that could have ruined everything if not handled correctly a realization is presented at the end pitting characters against each other and surprisingly the question at hand of what to do next is solved precisely as it should be at the cost of many lives whether he goes back to corporate america or stays a vigilante gibsons life will be forever changed the very end might be a tad too conveniently wrapped up with a bow but it does help bookend the film as a package of pure adrenaline rush satisfying on a cerebral level through all the bells and whistles exploding around each corner,fantasy
to be fight club with guns it to be the matrix without the actual matrix it to be mr  mrs smith the single years but try as it might its not quite on par with those films it has cool action and plenty of it the story is interesting enough as well but when it tries to have some sort of message thats where it stumbles from the very beginning its fight club envy shows  the selfloathing of the humdrum meaningless comfortable life the narration that is remarkably similar both in content and tone the sudden appearance of a stranger who can break you free of this mediocrity and let you truly live through pain and violence from there the story kicks into gear and is quite enjoyable its just that first 10 minutes and a snippet at the end that are trying too hard to make the movie something it is not and be a social commentary the director has a flare for staging some crazy action and creates some amazing visuals unfortunately the movie entertaining as it may be is much emptier than than the film i suspect he thought it was its a case of style over substance though not to the extent of say 300  another movie that was great fun and had extraordinary visuals but was light on substance what it is is exactly what the trailers sold it as a great overthetop suspendyourdisbelief actioner in the spirit of things like transporter and crank leave your brain at the door and just enjoy it,fantasy
alas this movie reminds me of marlon brandos line in on the waterfront i coulda been a contender i coulda had class like the faceplate reviewer i couldnt wait to get in the theater after seeing the trailers and teasers i mean hey jimmy mcavoy morgan freeman and terence stamp in a class action shoot em up and angelina jolie in the bargain i went waited with bated breath and yes action shoot em ups more action  but one of the loosest story lines in years i did not leave satisfied maybe some of you will and the little twists and turns will certainly not be revealed by me go see think about it and decide for yourselves i think you know how i saw it,fantasy
visit deusexmachinafilmblogspotcom for more reviews timur bekmambetov director of the russian fantasy night watch and its sequel day watch makes his hollywood debut with the release of a film loosely adapted from the comic books of the same name the premise everyman wesley gibson james mcavoy is torn from his monotonous life in order to follow in his fathers footsteps joining the fraternity a league of superassassinsmcavoy is thrown into action at the deep end an actor we are used to seeing play mostly strong character roles at first seems an unlikely action hero but the scot embraces it well his transition from office loser to superassassin is seamless a performance we have come to expect from a man destined for oscar greatness angelina jolie and morgan freeman also provide solid support as fox and sloan respectively adding alist appeal to the blockbuster sadly however the casts strong performances are about the limit to this films believability as the plot becomes so farfetched that you simply pass caringsacrifices a potentially intriguing plot in favour of action succumbing to the now irresistible urge of a plot twist and a thoroughly predictable one at that to give the story any life whatsoever one cannot help but feel that the film could have been so much more had it struck the balance between its visuals and its narrative more effectively there really isnt much to the story whatsoever what does exist spirals so far out of control that the final scenes become utterly irrelevant and at some points laughable exploding rats anyonethe films bias towards action ahead of plot may on the one hand be its downfall but on the other perhaps its saving grace the film certainly looks beautiful and the action flows flawlessly each sequence building at a perfect pace with the climax to said sequences never disappointing can also boast its own signature action shots following bullets forwards and backwards through the heads of the hapless targets is brutal yet brilliant and the pulsating camera is innovative if not slightly headacheinducingwhere quite clearly would like to be compared to and reach the heights of a film like the matrix it really struggles to get anywhere near it can be more accurately compared to a copy of heat magazine it has the glossy exterior and the big stars but look a little closer and theres no real substance and will just be tossed aside and forgotten about by next weekverdict whether it be car chases curving bullets or angelina jolies naked behind certainly looks superb it may not hold your attention to the very end but a decent if not forgettable watch three stars out of five,fantasy
movie reviewnew addition the question of is the movie worth buying renting or never seeing itmovie reviewcategory actionadventurewhen i first saw the previews of i did not really wanna see it it seemed like it was all flash and pizazz with little substance so i did not see it the opening weekend like i usually do instead i waited about two weeks after many of my friends said it was one of the best movies they have seen some of my friends compared it to fight club and the matrix two movies which after watching i have to say are vastly superior to this generic flashy hollywood action packed movie with as i predicted had little substance upon viewing itthe goodthe best thing about this movie is the action sequences and special effects which is enough to warrant a viewing at the movie theaters in fact i thought the action was pretty groundbreaking albeit with a little too much cgi computer generated imagery everything else is just really bland and rehashed even the twist at the end of the movie was sort of expected although it was predictable if you thought about it the acting was also ok at best this movieoverall left much to be desiredthe bad the plot was sort of ridiculous there were many things that did not make sense the acting was average at best the movie was too predictable too flashy and altogether too much hollywood to be considered a good movie the main actor james mcavoy for some reason i thought was not suited for the role of the main protagonist angelina jolie also looked sort of old in this movie as wellthe ugly a bullet flying though 10 miles of obstacles to slowly explode through a skull that was pretty cool and ugly at the same timeconclusion i can see why many people compared this to fight club and the matrix it seems that borrowed from both these movies but failed to live up to the originals basically is a very watered down and bland version of both these movies with a more idiotic plot and just as good action sequencesis it worth buying renting or never seeing it i think its worth renting once a year but its not worth buying at allsupra score 610,fantasy
this film if taken on its own isnt all that bad if you are looking for realistic actions and plausible situations please do your homeworki am not sure if this is a comic adaptation but it sure looks like one in fact in many of the scenes it reminds me a lot of matrix and sin citythe movie basically keeps a good pace with plenty of action sequences between short conversations now this is where i love the movie the dialogues are short concise and sweet the only thing i didnt like the main character being such a useless punk at the beginning however his transformation into a toplevel killer seems rather rushed sudden to say the leastthe twist in the story was expected from the very moment he was made to believe he is the heir to a great legacy there i smelled the rat and thought it would be far too simple too straight forward a movie to be made todayangelina jolie is beautiful however i had expected more out of her than the role she played in this action movie btw she is showing some aging since her last movieoverall the big names are wasted here this movie could have been made with less budget on the names and more on the story,fantasy
i knew from the adverts that this was a badboy assassin action movie plus it had angelina jolie whats more is there to think about plus i dont write reviews for blockbusters as a rule because everyone else is doing so already is different though and so you put in the dvd and are introduced to mr gibson via the dweeb voiceover narrative describing his pathetic little life and you go hey this isnt bourne ultimatumthats because it aint the bourne series good in their own right is not funny theyre serious and this aint the matrix for gods sake someone tell me if theres such a thing as a funny keanu reaves movie i dont think sowhen i say is sarcastic funny i dont mean girlfriend hahaha fake laugh funny i dont mean siskel  ebert oh that comedic line touched my sardonic sense of humor funny this isnt metrosexual funny this movie is guyz funny its a buncha guyz with pizza n beer funny its a buncha guyz who took the crap at work all day and need a hoot funny its bang tha wall funny its the funny that mothers and controlling girlfriends disapprove of because when the guyz arent laughing theyre roaring approval at the screen and the women frankly dont understand whynaw people is over the top action good script good characters the premise is simple little guy wakes up and realizes hes not one of the sheep instead hes a wolf and when he wakes up to being tha man everything wesley gibson goes through as his life changes touches something deep and ordinary in everyday guyz because the script was written to speak to working joes and guyz not the new york times elite not the cellphone vamps not the siskel  ebert wannabees not the vapid girlfriendand when that stapler is clicked for the last time and taken away   guyz say with quiet reverence oh yeah im down with that i am totally down with thatsneer at this movie if you want but you dont have the hormones you wont get itthis movie is a beer and pizza event call over the pals and throw the females into the kitchen and tell them to make sandwiches and stay out and turn the sound up,fantasy
not only is james mcavoy too weak in this movie to make his character believable but the screenplay includes far too many ridiculous elements some of the scenarios are laughable to make it enjoyable the story could make a decent film but it has been very badly executed in this production,fantasy
people who rate this movie high they should only watch cartoons,fantasy
then i dont know what isbullets can be strewn round your love ones they cantyoull be more attractive by firing guns you wontyoull be validated by having jolie snog you you wontshe wontetc etcsuch a bla bla of a movie made by meaningless nothingsit means an absolute nothingness but an encouragement of more meaningless violence which will have far more viscera and look far less cool in real life,fantasy
great action movie with a good story and good acting awesome musical score action and suspensepacked so many interesting ideas and cool scenes lots of memorable moments 3 viewings,fantasy
in the beginning it is hard to establish any relationship with the main characters as the movie progressesthis improves the showdown is rather good but the ending of the movie is horrible the main character looks deep into your eyes and says what have you been doing lately  implying that you the viewer should add meaning to your presumably miserable life by picking up your gun and getting back at the bad guys reallyif you  like me  would make a statement that school killings are not cool that getting even with society by massacering people is something we condemn then like this review and give this movie the rating it deserves in my opinion no more than three stars please,fantasy
this movie kind of stayed in a middle ground which was a little frustrating it wasnt campy enough to not be taken seriously and not serious enough to not be campy more or less i felt that this movie was just an excuse to use matrixtype effects and slow motion bullets,fantasy
feels dated and like its trying to be angelinas jolies fight club directors great style is a bit watered down his nightwatch series is much better the visfx dont hold up scriptwise this needed at least another draft or two,fantasy
james mcavoy brings a dynamic performance as wesley gibson making it all too believable that he is merely an office worker bee i think this movie really hits a chord with anyone who has ever had to be a grinder or a desk jockey i know for me as i watched this movie unfold i so desperately to find myself in wesleys shoes i think hes a character that almost anyone can relate to perhaps not always but at least once in your life youve been a wesleythe plot of the fraternity is definitely out there and is where this movie takes a big hit in terms of my rating i just think textile works used binary code to figure out who should be killed what does that seem absurd well thats because it absolutely isthe saving grace for me with this film is the incredible cgi and the extremely inventive action sequences i found myself in awe of the ways they portrayed some of the shooting sequences i loved this movie secretly but couldnt get past a trainwreck of a plot,fantasy
29 june 2008 pure action entertainment with a serious heart unbelievable but this is an action movie this is a actionpacked movie once it gets going with the innocent introverted man having to experience a much more brutal training program then has been brought to the screen before but maybe with a purpose its distracting to have some many improbables that spoil the action at times but it does keep one glued to the screen regardless of what happens the build up at the beginning isnt bad but the foul language seems out of place periodically the ending isnt bad either it has a selfreflective hard edged quality about it that leaves one thinking way to go angelina jolie finally there are weak plot points as far as greatest assassins go taken together the storyline is very good the action is very good the humanity is also very good its just that putting all together didnt quite result in a great movie there was room for improvement  in a captivating realistic way seven out of ten stars,fantasy
the plot is very different and action sequences that really bend on itcasting and choreography is good,fantasy
this is definitely a ridiculous movie but it knows it and doesnt pretend to be anything else its mindless fun action with great visual style and if you just take it at face value you will be greatly entertained,fantasy
stylisation can be used to enhance many aspects of a film the cinematography sound design or even acting in this case it is ballstothewalls action that enables cars to flip land on the side of a bus and dismount gracefully so suspend your disbelief and enjoy the brisk ride an office worker who essentially hates his life discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin from a group known as the fraternity this secret society train him vigorously might i add in an attempt to better his father based on the comic book miniseries that rarely anyone read this is not a bad adaptation the world of assassination is riddled in lore and fateful findings however these are quickly illustrated through freemans mesmerising monologues that release a sense of world building theres much to learn about weaving looms and bending bullets and the 110 minute runtime speeds along faster than a bomb strapped to a rat every action sequence is stylised from the effects of adrenaline to the shooting the wings of flies in slow motion it consistently appears to be exciting despite the occasional poor visual effects jolie is stunning freeman is captivating and mcavoy adores screaming and shouting in his tenuous american accent the problem is with its structure it is so fast paced that several aspects of the plot are not developed at all with a few underwhelming twists so much is spent on the training montage nearly 25 minutes that the actual plot feels like an afterthought then the final five minutes occur supposedly hilarious harking back to a previous scene and ends on a fourth wall break the only thing that broke was my spine from all the potential this film squandered yet it remains enjoyable nonetheless rapid ridiculously crazy and with plenty of blood especially from a keyboard smash i cant think of another film that has assassins block bullets by shooting another bullet bullet blocking bullocking actually maybe not that last one,fantasy
super fantastic group of assassins recruit the son of one of them to kill one of them maybe angelina jolie just likes to dominate men maybe morgan freeman can actually make a bad movie its not a comedy but youll want to laugh at some of the fantastic futuristic unbelievable activities conducted by the fraternity,fantasy
at the time of this film release james mcavoy wasnt what i would have thought of as actionassassin material but thats the point right there great visual effects and a really enjoyable storyline definitely a favourite,fantasy
every now and then a movie comes out that has elements which fly completely over the head of many otherwise savy film buffs from the polarized reviews here is clearly such a work the differences of opinion in reviews remind me very much of those on imdb for the signal with lawrence fishburn so eager to say why they think this or that is wrong or bad they pick apart a movie in its literal sense and choose to completely miss what the movies trying to convey a jaded perspective that demands a movie be strictly confined to our reality will serve nothing for a viewing of a fantasy film thereby losing the perspective that puts everything in a context the director and writers dont feed or preach to you but offer up the clues that allow you to open your minds eye as well either way you wont feel like you wasted your regularly scheduled movie couch time at the end of unless you whine about that cant really happen  no chit its a fantasy film  but maybe like me you may give it several watches and enjoy the fourthwall piercing narratives which are the lens to the higher plane the movie conveys i also enjoyed the humor  disdain as comedy is squeezed in rather well complimenting rather than distracting from the roller coaster ride and like a good thrill ride the movie is meant to be fun  dont look for finger nail biting tension or characters to cry for because they arent here nor are they meant to be look for characters whose roles are more metaphoric to the internal conflicts sparring for position in the heart and mind of a typical everyday person you can think about doing what you wish you could and be defeated by your own doubts and addictions to your status quo or you can choose to listen to the one idea for a life less ordinary as you define such  and not just answer the question why am i here but actually get up and fulfill it or you can choose to watch it as a technical critic with jaded tunnel vision imagine being in line for a ride with that guy telling you why everything about the ride should be different or isnt just right no thx mr buzzkillington i choose not to miss whole point,fantasy
curving bullets obviously never shot a real gun with real bullets heard of physics being put in a tank that heals you faster but they dont tell others so they can heal women with arms the size of skewers and they beat people those blows would do no damage to a person with their adrenaline pumped think sports and her punch stopping a hockey player or football player going straight through you loom orders diversity for diversity sake and numerous other things that these 21 century and late 20th century movies have becomethis movie and the people in it are awful and are terrible actors but as per usual they force the people on you and because you havent seen the true great well trained actors you accept them as good and they are not accept for maybe terrence stampyou always hear about reality in these movies but they have become so unrealistic it insults your intelligenceand if these people which they are not thank god are protecting us i will take care of myself lastly assassins rarely use guns and never never put civilians in harms way well very very rarely they look like the population of their target and may be fat bald old young all kinds of shapes and sizesi will take the old days with john wayne and his boys and they were real and family men and life and the traditions of america came first dont want to believe it john wayne captured the kgb agents that were sent to assassinate him and and turned them to americans from communists look at this militarycom how john wayne got rid of the kgb agents hired to kill himread this about real men and forget about morgan freeman with two earrings and the rest if we had these guys back when there would be no america thats why these men and the men before them were in charge understand so when reviewing here dont knock a president and capitalise godthe real men out there now are not i repeat not on the movie screen yelling and screamingtell me about the articlethanks for readinggod blessjames,fantasy
i would not spend my time watching this movie its bad and silly,fantasy
lacking the wit of hardcore henry 2015 or the grounding sophistication of the matrix 1999 this over the top of over the top exercise in expressionistic extremism is entertaining to a pointbut the breaking point is reached quickly as the brain turns to mush and the stomach wretches at the obnoxious portrayals of the characters that go through all the motion slow motion ultra slow motion fast motion sideways and upside down motion and over emoted emotionjames mcavoy screams sweats shouts yells and is in hypermode along with the visuals from the getgo and there is no contrast he is as manic as the tone of this graphic novel mark millar james jones come to lifethere is a good cast on board this violent splatterfest but bored you may be about midway but none of the name actors can compete with the cinematography and cgi trickery they and the audience are overwhelmed at the overt brutality and highcontrast highdef imagesthere is an audience for this type of thing but there are degrees and each film that takes on this template of videogame visceral is ultimately judged by the overall feeling and substance of what lurks beneath the slight of hand distraction from the story and characters that will remain after and are the after effects of the viewingthis is one you will feel while watching but not a whole lot of it will resonate especially the ludicrous and incomprehensible meaning of it all shallow but sensational the movie is when alls said and done witless but willing to offer a bang for the buck most folks will probably get their moneys worth of eye candy but those seeking something besides sweet sustenance need look elsewhere,fantasy
action and adventure teamed up with good storytelling is what you can expect here its not perfect but it does take us to the edge pretty well and manage to keep us there furthermore the story is not farfetched as many people take medications when in reality they can and should handle their pain why they need to explore beyond the pain where the answers of who they are and why they are here are to be found they threw in a twist or two so pay attention and enjoy how they have taken the fine art of killing and the reasons for it to new levels have a finger snack available popcorn sunflower seeds etc so you dont nail bite i wouldnt mind a sequel if they do a nice job on it but you never know about hollywood as they tend to ruin a good thing for the love of money what they dont know is that quality and good effort will bring its reward if you have faith perhaps hollywood needs more faith enjoy,fantasy
james mcavoy plays nerdy account manager wesley gibson the kind of guy who lets people walk all over him  his girlfriend kristen hager his best friend  coworker chris pratt who incidentally is getting it on with the girlfriend and his boss lorna scott to his complete surprise he learns that the dad who abandoned him as a baby was in fact a member of a team of assassins hooking up with a sleek lady fox angelina jolie and tutored by people such as sloan morgan freeman he decides that he will leave his humdrum life behind and embrace the idea of avenging his fathers deathits not surprising to see that this was based on a comic book series it does have a slick over the top sometimes cartoonish quality about it its often stylized to the point of insanity with a nonstop barrage of cgi gags if this is indeed meant to be viewed as a parody of matrix type action  scifi movies it works pretty well because it takes ridiculousness to a whole other level the world that our characters occupy is a world where bullets can be made to not fly in a straight line but curve around objects the visual gimmickry on display can be quite amusing this does offer some fun and gets better as it goes on and the story deepens whether the audience members predict the plot twists or not these twists do help to give weight to the saga and by then its hard not to root for wesley his story does have the appeal of any such tale that involves a worm turningfreeman is good as always and jolie is cast in a perfect part for her the solid supporting cast also includes terence stamp thomas kretschmann common marc warren and david ohara but most of the heavy lifting is done by top billed mcavoy on occasion his character can be annoying but he grows more endearing as he grows a pair so to speakoverall one thing can certainly be said about it may be silly but its not boringsix out of 10,fantasy

from the reviews on here i was expecting nothing more than a 2 star film so i was pleasantly surprised that i didnt completely want to turn it off though i did consider doing so about a third of the way through the acting was fine the action fine the concept weird enough to keep me intrigued and the twist while obvious still took the movie in a better direction than the one it had been going in my main problems with this film was that parts of it just didnt jive the first two thirds are a very fight clubesque story of a loser escaping his loserly life complete with voice over narration its darkly funny and delightfully if often over the toply ridiculous the final third however suddenly loses nearly all humor and becomes a violent revenge tale that took me a bit out of the movie and the ending was silly which takes me to the second blending issuefor me at least the most sympathetic character was by far the fathercross hes stuck in a life where he cant be with his son who he clearly loves and has watched grow up and wants nothing more than for that son to not follow in his footsteps and have a normal life then it turns out his whole career is a lie and he spends his final days trying to protect his kid from that world and that fate i didnt get it wesley should be honoring that sacrifice not abusing it with quippy little what the f are you doing with your life endings that made me thinkwell im living a normal life with a normal family that your dad the best person in this film would be proud of nice try honoring his memory wes i wasnt sure if the film was trying to convey that wesleys dad was wrong or that wesley is a special case even though not being a part of the fraternity new or otherwise was pretty much his dying wish oh well it wasnt the worst couple of hours ive spent,fantasy
i liked this movie it was an odd twist to the source material that still probably instilled a few of the points the original was trying to make id love to see an updated funny edgy remake of the comic book movie we live in a new age the jokes and violence that exist in the comic book are all tolerated as simple entertainment by an exceptional generation we could truly pay homage to an influential comic that spoke volumes about us as a species in this grand universei give it 8 out of 10 simply because i wished they had paid tribute to the source material faithfully the first time i can understand the violence was a bit much however i believe that with our collective intelligence rising we can begin to welcome art in any form without worry let us not mix fantasy with reality,fantasy
what the fk have you done lately wesley gibsonit is a reviewers nightmare to keep track of a movies mistakes disappointments and exhales of frustration all at once halfway through the movie you are forced to take a pad start taking notes which ironically enough is more fun than the movie itself and this movie is a tragic mistake in which everything falls out of line from the casting choices till the tiniest plot hole ill try to start from the plots embarrassing ridiculousness wesleys life seems like an allegory for every one of those who watched the movie as a bored and desperate human being trying to find something to be excited from in this case an action movie with assassins but even his anxiety attacks caused by his abilities is as laughable as his training and destiny utterly illogical nonessential violence rationally unsupportedreflecting upon the whole fraternity organisation it is beyond hilarious considering its history system cause and members the loom and fate making decisions through a loom how hopeless can someone be to create a fictional universe that would make such a cheap choice it is impossible to forget james mcavoy as wesley gibson this character is totally not suitable to him along with morgan freeman as sloan a poor casting choice indeed another reason for the 1 starawful characterisation should be the plot twist so unnecessary and idiotic also frustrating turn of events totally unsupported and moroniclastly wesleys revenge sloan the doughnut lady his former best friend how was that considered a revenge granted for sloan but for the others is this really how a destined assassin would get back at the most annoying lady hes ever encountered and his friend who lied and betrayed him completely out of characterand to answer your question mr gibson all i can remember doing lately is pondering whether i watch this movie or megatons colombiana let me inform you an unfortunate coin flip,fantasy
is based off the comic book series of the same title and follows a man who lives an unsatisfying life and gets recruited as an assassin to kill the man who killed his father the plot isnt anything special nor is it presented in any particularly special way we see how bad his life is get some intro to the characters some action a training montage etc nothing weve never seen before the characters are again nothing special there really isnt much development of them nor are they particularly interesting the main character was somewhat but everyone else isnt the action was decent i expected this just to be an overthetop fun action movie but there really wasnt all that much of it the handful of action scenes were pretty great there just werent enough of them one thing that particularly bothered me was james mcavoys scream he screamed fairly often and it was really annoying to listen to i dont know why it just didnt sound like a real scream overall is just decent the action is great but too spread out the characters are okay and the plot is extremely average in the end i doubt id recommend this movie as it really doesnt have much to offer,fantasy
nice to see that was given oscar nominations in two categories related to sound well the film was certainly loud enough but maybe the noise was to cover up the idea that the story was off the wall and unbelievablei can see in where the current cult tv hit mr robot gets some of what is driving it our protagonist james mcavoy is a drone of a human being working almost like jack lemmon at his desk taken advantage of by everyone senior to him as lemmon was in the apartment hes even having woman troubles as his girlfriend is being completely faithlesswell one morning hes the target of a shooting and saved by girl rambo angelina jolie turns out that mcavoy is the son of a professional assassin and hes got it in his blood to be one as well dad deserted the family as a kid and thats the reason for all of mcavoys issueswell mcavoy under the tutelage of jolie and head morgan freeman our hero develops into a full blown rambo type and joins the group of secret assassins that have been around for a thousand years but of course this is hardly the end of the story and what red blooded american male wouldnt want to get tutelage from angelina jolieyouve got to love morgan freeman that man can make the most pretentious drivel sound like its from the old testament and he does it in film after film which hes doing for a hefty paycheck between oscar material like boys dont cry well we all have bills to payfans of mindless action films will love this,fantasy
ok first of all a film can be over the top but only if it gives more of an explanation than your adrenaline goes fast soyeah bullets cant curve and no one on earth can do half the st in this film haha secondly you can tell every twist in this film way before it happens i turned to my friend about 30 minutes into this film and said ok im placing my bets now there will be a no i am your father moment this film fg rips of the whole family plot of star wars xd and at least the matrix gave a damn reason for the stuff that happens in the films and neo still takes a bullet to the leg xd  this film is genericpredictablefar fetched and trys to draw you in with hot girls and cool action scenes micheal bay may as well have directed this movie for christ sake haha,fantasy
the 3 points is for the first 30 min this part was funny seeing how our main actor have issue with his life his boss his girlfriend best friend  and struggle with anxiety saying sorry all the timebut sadly the rest i give 0 fine effects  but nothing new plenty of soaked clothes in red dye i guess that is blood plenty of shooting scenes with no pointjust pointless no fine acting just violence and boring i guess if they would have put a black mask on the guy that our hero chase in the train and he would have breathed i am your father i could have given it one more point,fantasy
as much as i hate angie i hate it even more when she plays a bad ass 30 kilogram tiny woman playing a bad ass assassinbut ok lets get to the point this movie is childish pathetic peace of crap everything is so stupid but not funny stupid jest plain ol stupid apparently if your heart beats 400 times in a minute you can slow the time and that helps you maneuver the bullets and of course that makes you a great killer we all know that reflexes dont have anything to do with heart rate and you cant fire bullets that dont fly straight unless you have hands faster then the bullet itself and hearth cant pump blood 400 times a minute there is so much stupid things happening that its hard to keep track lets just say that action sequences are more pathetic and gay than in fast and furious at least there you can laugh at the over the top crap here its just sadcouple of times they put the obligatory 3d crap in your face scenes that dont help this movie look like a real movie instead of crap this much stupid should make a comedy but this travesty tries to be serious movie at some points what nerve what nerve i wouldnt recommend it it isnt fun even for a first time viewers stay away i used the word stupid five times in this review but its still far away from enough to describe this movie maybe even worse and overrated than now you see me,fantasy
2008 dir timur bekmambetov  cast james mcavoy angelina jolie morgan freeman terence stamp common a decent screenplay james mcavoy plays an accountant who represents the title in that he is however he is needed to assassinate others who are also none of this is interesting and director timur bekmambetov shoots nonsense such as bullets colliding into each other this film is all visual just for the sake of being visual it is pointless and stupid and typical garbage out to sell absolutely nothing only mcavoy as the stressed accountant gives appeal he at least comes off as real as he struggles to maintain a position of sanity within this ultra reality that he has been thrust into jolie is basically reciting any action character she has ever played she is motivated by a sense of sexuality that captivates but that is useless when the role is total cardboard morgan freeman as the assassin head is also not breaking any new ground here he gives off that wisdom that we come to expect and here we dont give a sht terence stamp also makes an appearance common plays a guy who teaches folks how to shoot guns in that stupid way what he should do is train the screenwriter on how to write if it is visual effects that one seeks then this film delivers but do not expect intelligent writing pointless and stupid which is something no one asked for or score 2   10,fantasy
when i saw the trailer for this movie i got psyched stoked excited it looked really cool i happen to love bullettime and the trailer shows bullettime but what i had experienced on several different occasions is that the trailer shows all the cool stuff and then in the movie there is nothing new is not like that there are tons of awesome scenes bullettime slomo lots yes you can pick this movie apart for several reasons im sure plot holes unrealism blahblahblah but the bottom line should be is it entertaining let me answer yesthere are so many awesome scenes in this movie it is just incredible head shots super slomo blood violence action i just love iti have some minor gripes here and there but the coolness just flat out outweighs itis visual candy violence and if you love bullettime like me you will probably love thisthis is a perfect example of extreme action we dont get many as good at this if this movie and john wick had a baby it would just explode,fantasy
has a lot of cool action sequences and there are a lot of iconic moments in it but the tone is uneven if youre a fan of the comic book it was based on this is one of the least accurate adaptations ive ever seen the film follows wesley gibson james mcavoy a nobody loser he has no money no future or aspirations and worst of all has no will to do anything about it everything changes when he crosses path with fox angelina jolie she tells him that he is the son of one of the worlds greatest assassins and that his panic attacks are actually his superhuman abilities trying to break out daddys been murdered and only wesley can avenge him leaving his cheating bitch of a girlfriend his crummy job and the boss he hates behind he begins training and prepares to take his revengethis movie is a mash up between an action movie so stupid that it revels in its idiocy and one that just tries way too hard to be cool when it goes completely dumb is when it works begins by throwing physics on the ground and shooting it eighteen times with a scene that i thought was pretty awesome moments like this where the picture says yeah i know that makes no sense but isnt it amazing are when it works weve seen movies about leatherclad assassins theyre always being played up as ultracool killers that somehow never get hired to kill nice people i say if youre going to make an unrealistic film about assassinations go all the way and make it the most improbable movie ever weve got people driving at ridiculous speeds making cars flip into the air so they can shoot at their targets people jumping on trains shooting each other from miles away shooting bullets with their bullets and a terrific gag where someone gets hit in the face with a keyboard that will have you cheeringwhat doesnt work with the movie is that about 50 of the time it doesnt go all the way this movie is rated r there should be a scene where wesley has just collected a big bounty on a criminal mastermind and he rewards himself with a weekend in vegas where he drives nothing but solid gold limousines and pays two bikini babes to lick peanut butter off of each other it should also have been much gorier than it is to capitalize on the fun aspect of butchering bad guys think of another film thats ridiculously violent to the point where it becomes hilarious like paul verhovens robocop that movie went all the way in satirizing violence this one does it half of the time when it isnt a dumb loud action movie the story is still plenty ridiculous but the movie doesnt want you to think its absurdthe fraternity the league of assassins that wesley is recruited into takes its orders from get this a loom sloan morgan freeman interprets chunks of the tapestry it weaves and reads errors in the way the fibers are put together translating it into binary code that gives the assassins their next targets names what the weave is always correct and if you dont go ahead with its orders bad things will happen what i to see was wesley realize that this whole thing is absolutely ridiculous i a revelation that all along these people were killing random strangers for no reason he would have had to go all badass and take down his mentors because their next target was the pope or something that would have hit the perfect noteive always proclaimed that books and movies are very different forms of storytelling and those directors and scriptwriters should feel free to interpret the material differently to make it work for the screen but takes it on a whole new level the book and movie begin similarly but then they couldnt be more different there are no supervillains no plots to destroy the world no trips to other dimensions no colorful costumes or massive conspiracies that allow our characters to do whatever they want i understand why the character of wesley was changed from an unlikeable antihero who kills people who annoy him in cold blood has nothing but disdain for ordinary people and gleefully rapes women but why even call the film if it has maybe 15 minutes worth of material in common and of all of the elements you had to retain from the original material why keep the final line from the book where the protagonist weve been following insults the audience and berates them for not being as cool as a fictional character its not that is really that bad in fact there are a lot of good moments some of which are really iconic including some of morgan freemans lines towards the end which are priceless the problem with the film is that the target audience fans of the book will be completely disappointed by the amount of changes made and it doesnt stand on its own very well either im not a huge fan of the book despite really enjoying the concept and seeing the great parts in it i just couldnt get over the childish insults and selfhate the author had piled on top of the character i just couldnt cheer for at all i was really hoping that this would be a chance for a third party to come in and fix all of the problems and make it a really cool film when i realized that was not at all what i was going to get i was still disappointed that the film chickened out when it really mattered since the movie is about 50 awesome stupid action and 50 missteps the best i can give it is a middleoftheroad rating of 25  5 on dvd february 21 2014,fantasy
there are different genres in cinema there are dramas there are family comedies there are classical actions like rambo and there is this fantasy action genre that does not suit anyone if you like fantasy if you like seeing a lot of shooting and if you hate your job at your stupid officewatch this movie the actors are great the jokes are not bad the social message typical for so many american movies in the last 10 years is to be mentioned as well but i leave it all to you prepare for a funny and wild ride do not look for any deep meaning just have fun angelina is not my favorite actress by all means but she is not important here the other actors make the film better and better,fantasy
a thousand years ago a clan of weavers became assassins for good calling themselves the fraternity wesley gibson james mcavoy is a loser office drone then fox angelina jolie saves him from an assassin she tells him that he comes from a long line of assassins and somebody is trying to kill himas much as wesley finds the world so annoying that he needed to be medicated thats how i felt about the visual style at first director timur bekmambetov does a too good of a job portraying wesleys anxiety the action is uniquely add its fun until its not mcavoy is playing the runt of the litter hes a great actor but his character complains too much jolie is the cool killer and morgan freeman is the wise sensai as for the loom idea its a tough pill to swallow at least dexter investigates his targets before killing them,fantasy
i really only have myself to blame for this having seen the trailers which show the stunts and the bending bullets i knew what i was in for some mindless visual popcornin many ways you have to just suspend your disbelief for this movie and then you can enjoy it more if like me you struggle with that then this movie will irritate the heck out of youfor me the most entertaining parts of this movie were wesleys james mcavoy interactions with his friend his boss his girlfriend like superhero movies its when the hero first discovers his powers that are the most fun as we can identify with him however once wesley learns his trade and turns into some kind of cross between superman and james bond that it becomes a bit tediousangelina jolie adds the requisite hotness morgan freeman adds the requisite gravitas neither of them break a sweat angelina in particular manages to maintain the exact same face for the whole movie which is quite an achievementthere is also too many slow motion exploding heads for my liking it takes gratuitous violence to an extremeoverall if your brain is too tired to watch something good this will divert you and frustrate you dont expect any more than what you see in the trailer though,fantasy
is set in chicago where wesley gibson james mcavoy works in an office as an accounts manager he is bored with his life  feels that its pointless while in a supermarket wesley is saved by a woman angelina jolie who he has never met before after an assassin named cross thomas kretschmann tries to kill him the woman who turns out to be called fox takes wesley back to an old textile mill which is a front for a secret organisation of assassins known as the faculty which was founded a thousand years ago to kill people that fate decides in order to keep the balance between good  evil in the world wesley meets sloan morgan freeman who runs the show  is told that cross used to be a member of the factulty but left  is killing other members of onebyone  that cross has already killed wesleys father the factulty train wesley to be a top assassin in order to go after  kill cross but all is not as it seems as wesley discovers he has been lied tothis american  german coproduction was directed by timur bekmambetov  is generally considered one of the better big budgeted hollywood action films of recent years  while its entertaining enough  i have no major problem with it i have to say i dont consider the classic that many seem to i will stop short of calling it a bad film because its not but i cant bring myself to call it a great one either is loosely based on a graphic novel comic book miniseries by scottish artist mark millar published between 2003  2004 apparently the main difference is that the faculty in the comic book was run by super villains who killed all the superheroes or something like that as i have never even heard of the comic books before watching the film so i really dont know anything about them while a lot of the people who rate th film enjoy the totally unrealistic  psychically impossible action scenes like cars flipping over  doing barrel rolls mid air to the way certain characters can bend bullets round corners or make them fly in perfect circles i found these cartoon style scenes off putting  took me right out of the film  just stopped it dead as i was left shaking my head sure some of the best action films around are far fetched  stretch credibility but the things that happen in are just too silly  left me cold  detached from the plot twists  story which arent that great anyway everything about is a stretch really from the plot twists to the fact that within a few weeks wesley has turned into some super assassin who takes out the entire faculty without them even getting a shot off at him probably works best during its first half as we are introduced to wesley  his boring nine to five life as he is used  abused by everyone around him his narration is quite funny  there are some amusing scenes like when he tells his fat boss what he thinks of her  going to the cash machine  seeing messages that mock his life but as has been said before it feels a lot like fight club 1999 during these scenes they have a certain dry ironic relevance  a lot of what wesley says seems to make sense  might be all too familiar for a lot of us i supposeat just over 100 minutes long zips along at a nice pace to be fair to it never lets up  theres overblown action scene after overblown action scene that seem to have been written designed  shot purely to look cool  not much else from cars flipping over each other to acrobatics on high speed trains to a derailment to crashing cars car chases shootouts explosions fights  a very attention grabbing opening in which a guy leaps hundreds of feet between skyscrapers while firing  taking out a team of assassins as he flies through the air is pretty violent as well theres a fair bit of blood  a few scenes of bullets travelling in slow motions as they go through peoples heads  burst out the front splattering blood everywherewith a supposed budget of about 75000000 a lot of money was spent on  it shows with no expense spared action scenes  cgi computer effects which are pretty good filmed in illinois new york  prague in the czech republic the acting is alright morgan freeman seems bored james mcavoy seems a bit boyish  slight to be a tough action hero while angelina jolie is as awful as always  again proves you should not hire rappers like common to try  actis a decent enough action film as long as you can suspend every ounce of disbelief you have i mean every ounce of it works best when its trying to be humorous  has some amusing dark satire that feels all to familiar look i thought was a good film  id recommend it  watch it again but i didnt think it was as great as many seem to apparently a sequel is currently in development,fantasy
havent the wachowski brothers got a lot to answer for it seems that hardly a day goes by without another new action movie appears created on a computer using footage shot in front of a green screen in a warehouse somewhere instead of using actors on location and blow me as if to illustrate my point here is another one chockfull of all the ridiculous action you associate with cginfused action flicks this is one film that doesnt look too good if you peel away the pixels and gawk at whats leftwesley gibson a miscast james mcavoy is a bored weedy office worker who feels trapped in his dull and repetitive life but before he can scoop up another handful of antianxiety pills he bumps into the oddlynamed fox angelina jolie who throws him headfirst into a bulletfuelled adventure it turns out that wesley is the son of a superassassin a member of a secret society called the fraternity who recruit wesley in order to hunt his fathers killer  a rogue member called cross thomas kretschmann as wesleys skills improve under the tutelage of fox the fraternitys leader sloan morgan freeman monitors the situation closely as crosss personal crusade against the fraternity threatens the organisations very existenceit sounds like it should have been an absolute winner but is the architect of its own demise for example i can go with the concept of the fraternity and its thousand years worth of assassination to maintain stability in an unstable world but why do the victims names appear in weaving from the loom of destiny or whatever the damn thing was called how did they appear before weaving was invented and why did it change to secret messages in textiles and why hadnt they updated it to something more 21st century never mind the pretty cg provides enough distraction to stop you from looking into the plot too deeply while jolie does her bit by pouting endlessly and occasionally flashing the flesh as for mcavoy he is not the sort of actor for this role  the first half of the film is spent whining and screaming a lot then when he realises hes actually a badass the abs come out and he cant go anywhere without a faintly silly grimace and a gun in each hand the action where it comes come is certainly exciting but only possible in the mind of someone thinking in cg  vehicles dont behave the way they do here and i refuse to accept that you can make bullets go around corners by flicking your wrist when pulling the trigger nothing in this movie feels believable  granted do any of these action films have the faintest whiff of reality to them any more  but when something is so fantastic and so garnly it stops being exciting and starts being stupid remember when you were a kid racing your toy cars around the living room and crashing them into stuff if you still do that then welcome to your dream film there are things to commend however  the cg while dominating almost every scene is well done and director timur bekmambetov has a terrific eye for the amount of bloody violence shown on screen and how best to shoot it there is a certain amount of enjoyment to be had especially when the plot twist arrives and the film really seems to kick into gear but i cant help feeling that is a massive disappointment that it should have been a film to rival the matrix  something desperately to be  but ends up as yet another wannabe the reasons for the failure are quite simple the wrong leading man excessively silly action scenes and a plot with more holes in than katie prices range of knickers what it needed was a bit more restraint a brain to tell the innerchild that cars dont flip as easily as they do here and a brief shot of jolies wet butt shouldnt be the sole recommendation of a movie sadly with thats exactly what you do get but unless your taste in movies hasnt evolved since the time of your early teenage years then youll probably find other films more worthy of your time,fantasy
i have to admit that the idea is pretty much original in a funny way actually i mean shooting the wings of the flies  curving bullets it is funny as much as it is thrilling the production was big also and the director did really good jobhowever the movie was too short i think the writer must have ran out of line hathe characters has fine identities but there is no enough depth in the characters thats why i stated earlier that the movie is too short i mean spending some time to enhance the characters could have done some more positive affecti also would like to state that angelina needs some series help  some body gets that woman something to eat please  she looks like she didnt had any meal in weeks and this is really extreme i sayto sum it up  its fun to watch but youll be forgetting it as soon as you are out of the door,fantasy
is that kind of testosteronefueled neurosesfree beastly movies made to satisfy prepubescent boys with hot dangerous women loads of guns exploding heads bloodspatter etc etcthe plot is stupid despite some vaguely interesting twists but overall the premises are dumbtypically i should have hated it but but i cant help myself but admit that hey it was fun there is a lot of black comedy in it with some lines quite reminiscent of fight club on certain aspects and wesley cynicallydepressed voiceover made me smile a few timesthe pacing is quite good you are never bored well its almost too much and you can easily dive into the storywhat makes the difference with though is the choice of james mcavoy as the lead who decidedly is an incredibly versatile actor try to compare this performance to atonements or shameless and youll get what i mean he is flawless as the postmoderndepressed wesley a looser soon to turn assassin and the transformation the protagonist undergoes is just wonderful to watch he is the biggest asset of the movie bringing a bit of depth in itjolie and freeman are ok their part werent that demanding thoughfinally the movie is visually interesting one can not fault the direction here for its audacious and allows most of the movie to have no plot whatsoeverto summarize leave your brain at the door to watch it there is room to enjoy it despite its huge flaws,fantasy
spoilers08 film lightly resembles04 comicfans of the 1st released book sound unimpressed with the film its castinganything else based on a comic thats not another comicthe graphic novel a gritty favorite for its medium had dark characters extreme violencea wicked underworld revealed below the streets of our beloved earth where comicbook villains run a post superhero world something of a fun elseworlds universe idea with great references to your favorite comic heroes08 seems like a pg13 spawn of 04s original plot because it kind of is the little addressed reason why moviecomic writers took the original assassin fraternity concept then went their mediums way a fun idea with 2 great products the film written of course with the movie rating system in mind while the comic was free to go anywhere with this concept which it did artists drew the lead female psycho the fox from halle barrys swordfish01 likeness in orange fox ears marshal mathers face was used as the source for the lead protagonist wesley gibbons because the artist felt like it so if 08 was actually a faithful comicbook movie which its not 04 fans would only be satisfied by a nc17 rating plus emin3mplaying a non rapperthe artists wooden still life for the fox hbin 04 the fox teaches wes to just murder for fun in 08 fox trains wes as a professional assassin with no killing people he hatesraping an alist celebrity as wesley did in the graphic novelthe foxs film face is hollywoods fleshhot blooded demi goddess angelina jolie a bony postchildren physique makes it not her best sexy yet but shes the one actor to play any femme fatale with a unique perfection and it saves us a redrawn character reprized by the awful hbthough this incarnation of the purest spicy honeybodily temptation from the same piece that brought us lara croft on screen has little substance the tattooed beaut nails the film role of the fox far better than hb nailing it to a cross from failing storm  catwoman to making the dullest bond girl she needs to stop being called a strong female lead and do silent body double jobs not complain good female roles are hard to come by so dont ruin the  roles youve been blessed with08s street clothed heroine comes off a bit more hb than wed like to play the cold killer better than foxy of comedy centrals drawn together doing an obnoxious black lady impression for 110min no sequel yet due to the actors lack of interest in the roles complexity something a real actor would halt the filming of most fora common comics2film forum complaint hb not cast now imagine if thats the sequel which is an actual complaint forum idea helps appreciates casting because hb is a terrible actor known for nudity in her early rise to fame roles an effective gimmick but not talent which is why her image was used in the comic stupid movie review article headlines have said hbs good for strong respectable black woman roles but notice shes not cast before jolie for roles of her own likenessof course eminem wasnt cast as mr gibbons thats ridiculous instead a distinguished professional actor james mcavoy gives us the awkward and apologetic wesley the loser gibbons this gives the film a filmy kinda feel like a film should have this making it the theatrical presentation of the assassin fraternity idea complain about mm and hell baring for lack of interest in the roles insteadmost of the books villains arent even replaced by assassins and their many actor likenesses arent played by those people because its not a retelling a fresher idea indeed running the comic way with the comic and film4film not based off each other at all thats the answer to the lame complaint movie not like the book mostly because a movies a movie and a boother characters and actors not included are any superheroesmaybe replaced by targets if you want to prick about it or the many actors the characters were drawn to the likeness ofrephrased for sticklers replaced by better actors get it ones drawn on a page the others movie images with a story that fits into 110 minutes holy top cow its such an old worn obnoxious and weak assed complaint that the book was better its always made by the same idiots whod wine on about the old anything being the untouchable then going on about how its the untouchablewhen complaining about why this new thing shouldnt exist in this case theyre not even retellings or translationsdirectly of the other its an idea being expanded and told the way that type of story telling goesor is felt it has to go even for kickass the book can include a longer story with more details and ideas expressed while film can use its possible techniques to express details regardless 04s a decent product of comics 08s a cool film any film cons again maybe the physique a worn thin frame from adding kids to her life since last sexy bodied flick left mrspitt with scrawny armsthe film with an unneeded partial hind shot which asks why do that as it was actually a doublewhy not a ridiculously rewarding back instead of ridiculously accurate she didnt do it herself because she looked frail so why only upgrade to scrawny giving us the same backshots it seems movie magic could cure this but still her abilities as an actor make up for it compared to using a no talent starso if you want mark millars fox on screen watch swordfish or download the

this film is a hodgepodge of better films it borrows many of the effects the matrix pioneered some scenes look like they were adapted from tossed matrix storyboards it borrowed the existential themes from fight club about a lost working drone of generation x trying to find strength and meaning in his depressing life it took several other plot points and ideas from other films but i dont want to spoil anything im not saying you cant recycle old ideas but stealing them without paying the necessary homage is very uncreative and uncool was packed to the brim with clichs in the dialogue the plot the characters the sometimes guy richieesquire cinematographyand well just everything i can just see how the details of this film were hammered out what would the matrix look like if they could curve bullets well now we know i recommend to anyone who hasnt seen fight club or the matrix i unfortunately couldnt enjoy it when id already seen the ideas done better in 1999what theyre making a 2 son of a,fantasy
i havent read the graphic novel though i am considering it from reading up on it i understand that they took the title and a couple of characters and then made this up from there does that even count as an adaptation this is a mindlessand unpretentious flick and the noteworthy aspect here is the stylized depiction of the actionthough there could be more of it for this being an hour and forty minutes long and the fact that the scenes remain exciting in spite of how over the top they are it is purely a macho fantasyif it does actually treat the morality issue reasonably indulging in shamelessly doing things that everyone who feels inferior would want to be able to i dont think the blame lies with the director he seems to know what hes doing and even something simplistic does take skill to helm this isnt emotionally engaging and the lack of risk and danger does lead to some of the things intended to be thrilling to be nothing other than visually appealing a couple of bits in the montages make it look like the editor forgot when they occur in the movie their are details that have not been divulged yet including some related to the plot line the lead is noticeably devoid of charm and the cruelty he faces from his surroundings is ridiculous unrealistic and not credible i hate to be superficial but jolie looks unusually sickly in this her situation at the time has my full sympathiesi believe her mother had recently passed away and i completely get preferring to work and distract herself the rest of the cast and their acting varies it is forced when this goes for being sharp and clever and it tries way too hard no role is all that developed this has a brutal tone the dvd contains two short featurettes that are decent enough and reasonably informative there is swearing violence and nudity in this and they are all gratuitous i recommend this to those in the mood for turning off their brain and enjoy cool sequences that are a feast for the eyes 710,fantasy
after seeing you might say to yourself that was one good bad action flick all the essential ingredients came into place the action the fling the sex and all the other cheesy schmaltz you see in every action flick the saving grace in this movie that made it all worth while was the heartpulsing energy in many ways it has a similar feel to the anime cowboy bebop coming to life here with similar characters and familiar situations the story is pretty much recycled material that you may have seen many times before however it scores points on suaveness crooked politics and plenty of machoinflated chaos that will make any sexcrazed teenage boys eyes pop and the nonstop adrenaline will keep you begging for more if you like movies of this caliber than the more power to you and if you dont thats your prerogative but after watching you must first ask yourself was it all worth the while well that question depends entirely how see the movie me personally i think it has a lot of promise on bluray high definition it has that guilty pleasure feel to cure those latenight blues after youve finished a big term paper and looking to blow off some steam what makes work is the little tidbits to make a movie worthwhile the implausible encounters the seductive nature intended here plus all the heartpulsing action is one to keep you entertained for the next two hours the drawbacks in this film is that it looks fun but the honesty in the excitement is dormant the logic is obviously absent and the relevance is virtually omitted the thrills are excited enough and with all the chaos happening here it wont entirely disappoint russian born director timur bekmambetov conjured up a pleasing effort and and it shows he has the knack in providing a sense of rhythm but that gift that he has is still yet to come into good terms of what is a fairly decent flick if those hollywood hacks can conjure up a story thats not dependent on cheap thrills or explosions we may see him one day bag an oscar in the near future but for know i guess hell have to depend on pleasing his audience with pyros ans explosionsthe performers gave me the felling they were having a blastpun intendedand they showed realism in their stoic expressions and not taking too many gregarious risks the real scene stealer in this movie is the excellent performance by angelina jolie as she stands out pretty much on her own here her charm and charisma attracts her audience of all ages genders and all levels of intelligence jolie just makes every one of her complex scenes look so easy even through all the unbelievable predicaments shes encountered never once does she make it look campy now theres someone you can look up to,fantasy
the title says it all james mcavoy plays a meek office scrub named wesley gibson who finds about his fantastic supernatural heritage as his world slowly falls apart around him thanks to his dead end job cheating girlfriend horrid boss and sleazy best friend his discovery of this heritage leads to instantaneous wealth with the transfer of his fathers assets wesleys father who seemingly died in a fantastic shootout at the movies beginning was an assassin and member of the fraternity a group of killers who execute their targets according to a list printed on textile by the loom of fate the fraternity assassins have the ability to curve a bullets trajectory after it has been fired accurately fire a shot from thousands of yards aways and perform a number of superhuman acts of agility and car stunts thanks to cgi and wire work angelina jolies fox and morgan freemans sloan tutor wesley in his abilities through torture and experimentationthe first half of this film was highly entertaining but falls apart when wesley learns the truth about his dad and takes revenge on the fraternity im not a person who has a problem with violent films but it has serve a purpose other just giving a movie a high body count the ending gunfight between wesley and the fraternity almost made me sick james mcavoy is a solid actor and plays wesley through his transformation from office wimp to superhuman killing machine very well angelie jolie doesnt bring anything to this film since she looks looks as brittle as a toothpick and not charismatic enough to be a femme fatale morgan freeman is very good the part evangelist and part con man sloan but thats not a surprise since he could read the obituary page and still sound cool overall a very unsatisfying film,fantasy
this movie was destined from the start to become a cult classic interesting camera footage thrilling action scenes a dark story line witnessing a lead characters progression from a normal everyday guy into something beyond your comprehension superhero movies of recent years have all been based on the same principle the matrix was one nonstereotypicalsuperhero movie that started in exactly the same way with the clueless naive and weak office employee sat at his desk thinking there must be more to life and then suddenly something extraordinary happens to him changing his life foreverbut more than any other this film reeks fight club to me whos leadcharacter or at least half of it was brad pitt funny how that works out eh the style of narration and flow of the plot is almost identical as is the apathy and even the insomnia of the lead character the angry and fedup boss the unnecessary violence and shock scenes its all there if you blink for just a second you could actually imagine ed norton in the role i say all this not as a criticism anything copied from a classic like fight club is bound to be good but just that it doesnt do anything really differentthere are some flaws too at the start the guy finds out that his dad has died and that he has just inherited 3 million dollars from a guy he never knew he is then coerced into becoming an assassin to hunt down and kill the guy who murdered this father that he never knew but was suddenly so full of revenge for he puts up with countless beatings knife attacks verbal abuse etc just because he didnt like being pushed around by his boss in the office any more hello the guys got 3 mil in the bank he would never need to work again or be pushed around by anyone why would he choose to be beat up and risk his life for people he doesnt know and for a cause he has no reason to care anything about over catching the next plane and going on holiday for the rest of his lifeanother thing angelina jolie yeah she looks great but should she this isnt a tombraider sequel where everything is enhanced and perfect and you just accept it because you know its based on a computer game its not going to be realistic but if she was really that hot she wouldnt go to work as an assassin shed be an actress a supermodel in porn or something like that whats the point of becoming an actress and playing yourself they shouldve roughed her character up a bit but then it was probably a clause in her contract that she had to look super hot else how else would she outshine the rest of the cast the final annoying thing was that the main character only had 6 weeks of training theres nothing to suggest his lifestyle was anything close to healthy before that point given his apathy and yes we find out that his heart rate can beat faster and that he can use that to his advantage by slowing things down but that doesnt make him more healthy far from it but suddenly after 6 weeks hes shooting like the worlds greatest sniper on acid hes able to hit bridges with his face while on top of a speeding train and still live and he can kick like like bruce lee all in 6 weeks a little more credibility couldve easily been added with that respect just by changing the time to a couple of years something like that the fact they specifically write into the narration 6 weeks ago i was a nobody just cries out bs why even say it the fraternity the story focuses on was supposedly 1000 years old but it couldve been a million years old for all the depth this lent to the story and whats with the giant magical loom if it doesnt have an explanation should it really be in the film seems to me that it was added only to show that sloan was a liar which in turn cause the lead character to kill his father and stops miss jolie from putting a bullet in his head when she finds out at the end a pretty crucial plotturner right so why was it so lame there are plenty of more rational and believable ways to replicate this part of the story but the way it is it all ends up a bit messy and trite they go to visit the founding place of the order but learn nothing and talk about nothing so also go there what for the final thing that annoyed me was near the end when they try to kill the main character but they cant because weve trained him too well why did they train him so well they said they needed him because he was the only one his father wouldnt kill so why would they need to train him at all just give him a motive and a gun that would be enough you dont need to teach someone how to bend bullets if they could shoot their target at point blank rangethe action scenes were great anyway imaginative well planned and perfectly executed the camera work if not entirely original was awesome to watch and had me rewinding in quite a few placesoverall look past its flaws and its a great cult action film memorable and groundbreaking however it is  not,fantasy
oh where to begin best part of the film were the first 10 minutesno sript no story line ok acting i guess listen all it is possible to make a good action movie it can be done see dia hard see crank 1 see the bourne series see casino royaletc this movie had pretty neat visuals and sound but that was it nothing elsei think the entire film had a total of 300 words  i was so bored i started counting the wordskill 1 to save a 1000how about risking a 1000 lives to kill that onefriendly advise dont see this film there are much funner films that are entertaining and well madeimho,fantasy
i had been away from movies the whole last year so just last month i bought all the good ones of 2008 on dvd i think so and watched them one by one and i thought that was the best action film of the lot lets start with direction timur bekmambetov isnt the best in business to flesh out characters and stress necessary plot points its still hard to imagine someone else doing his job though had it been an american director in his place or british wed probably be watching this movie through rose colored spectacles where everything goes right in the end and the films hero tells us how sorry he is on his past actions and promises to work hard from than on to save america from an impending disaster in 2 there is nothing like that and director bekmambetov sees to it instead this is a very nasty movie about a bunch of supervillains superassassins for the movie whose ideas of redemption and rightwrongs differ vastly from the rest of the mankindleading the cast is james mcavoy as wesley gibson a loser whos just found out that he is not after all a loser and he does a good job to support him is angelina jolie with her dont look at me like that and mind your own business kind of attitude which completely diminishes any chances of a bruce bannerbetty ross kind of relationship finally morgan freeman is as good as ever as the coldblooded and deadly assassin leader the rest of the cast doesnt have much to do and simply keeps the lead ones busythe films main weakness lies in its screenplay which is senseless and leaves a lot to be desired were never told how the leadership is changed in the fraternity and how the leaders know how to work out the loom of fate nor is it made clear that why a thousand year old society has come to operate in chicago the film also throws a ridiculous looking twist halfway through which was visible a mile away a lot of story elements were compromised to make way for the incredible albeit physically implausible action scenes which make up the bulk of the filmtalking about action sequencess version of physics would probably have made einstein cry aloud in hell and left newton rolling in his grave what with characters using each others vehicles as jumppads shooting someone in the head from miles away and well bending bullets that still is no more unbelievable than someone sprouting webs from his hands and someone else flying at supersonic speeds these guys are supervillains remembers biggest strength is its free spirit which safely guides it through if you are looking for an action movie with over the top action and some good performances look no further,fantasy
the guy who borough you nightwatch and daywatch has another blockbuster for you unlike the other two movies this one is shot entirely in english for his first english movie he chose this project which is a free adaptation from the comic  i havent read that so i dont know how free the adaptation iswhile the better known names are morgan freeman and angelina jolie the main actor is james mcavoy and hes doing a great job hes holding the movie more than together without his more than stellarconvincing performance the movie might have been less enjoyable there almost too many clichs build into the story and some turnstwists are pretty foreseeableapart from the acting the movie is very visual but if you have seen the previous movies from the russian director you might have guessed that great effects and sound editing a popcorn movie that deserves that praise,fantasy
this movie is just totally crazy and overthetop besides the fact that it features a totally implausible concept it also features lots of overthetop action sequences that will take you back to the days that the action from the matrixmovies was still something new and impressive even though its not original anymore it still works out surprising effective as well as refreshing in this movieyou should give credit for this to director timur bekmambetov to be honest i didnt though he would be ready to do a big hollywood production yet or better said i didnt think hollywood would be ready for it he has a very distinctive fast directing style that besides can also really be described as weird and different it makes this action in this movie work out as original as well as truly dazzling its mostly its action and the handling of it that makes this one of the better and more pleasant action movies of recent yearsits a movie that luckily doesnt take itself too serious but not by making itself totally ridicules the movie has plenty of humor and comical character in it to consider this a fun and pleasant one to watch its concept may really not let this movie sound like a good or likable actionflick but you should simply give this movie a chance and you will most probably end up liking it its an unexpectedly and also unlikely good moviethe movie also features a good musical score from danny elfman who finally delivers a really great and memorable score again for a movie it had been a while that he composed anything memorable or distinctive from his other worklots of big stars were signed up to give this movie a boost but yet the main role is being played by the humble scotish james mcavoy who plays a perfect likable and probably for lots of persons also really recognizable loser who needs to become an hero and learn to assassinate people with his unique talents angelina jolie also never looked more foxy before in any other movie role she is one tough chick in this movie without ever loosing any of her beauty as well the presence of actors such as morgan freeman terence stamp and thomas kretschmann also help to uplift the movieno matter how ridicules its story perhaps is it still remains a good written that features a couple of twists in it as well its the combination of story directing and action that the movie works out as a credible and effective one but foremost you should simply enjoy this movie for what it is a simple entertaining actionflick with some wonderful and original action moments in it810httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,fantasy
first of all despite what everyone keeps saying this is not a st film its not the worst film ever etc etc good stuff about it  good cinematography and sound this was really good it really fits an action movie  its entertaining and suspenseful  great fx the explosions and gore and stuff was great in it as is most box office films these days but it was really good in this  some good ideas during the plot and things  some bloody cool fight scenes and stupidly farfetched scenes  the ending is awesome as welltheres the highlights there obviously a bit more good about itbad stuff about it  some people wont really like the farfetchedness of it but i think in some parts it really adds to it  the music is annoying generic and way too  sculpted for the film like near the beginning one of the first songs playing is basically describing what james mcavoy is thinking  james mcavoy is really weak in some parts of this film some of his acting is just horrible especially in the intro with his voice over which is just a ripoff of fight club but some parts his does really well  even though its farfetched some parts are just too unrealistic or rash to really consider like how his panic attacks are some genetic superpower or how he learns how to be an assassin like right away  doesnt really keep to the graphic novel but was a good interpretation of it but maybe some parts of the graphic novel wouldnt have looked as good on filmoverall it was good if youre a serious moviegoer into more realistic action and less superpowered assassins give it a missif youre into just watching an ok film do it its cooler than most action movies that came out the other yearif youre into the matrix fight club die hard this could be for you as it takes some ideas from those films,fantasy
this was a very disappointing movie it had great action sequences but the plot was extremely thin boring and predictable once the main character is recruited and trained i would be amazed if anyone in the audience doesnt realize that he in fact is going to kill his own father rather than avenge himi really dont feel that there is a need to show in slowmotion bullets going through someones skull the skin being stretched out and the little bits of brain and skull wafting out oh and we get to see it both in forwards and reverse how uncool so what is the director thinking okay we have a thin script with a paper thin plot lets put some gore and well worn out special effects in oh yeah and angelinas sweet booty that should help fool the audience this film is too matrixesque with some elements from jumper thrown in give me a break if you are going to copy the matrix please at least make the plot fun or over the top either suspend my belief entirely or make the film and characters believablemy recommendation skip this and rent the matrix series and jumper both of these are fun and highly entertaining,fantasy
okay so heres my world first idea do you remember reading those choose your own adventure books as a kid basically you read a few paragraphs and at the end of the page you are presented with a choice now if you were like me you probably didnt even bother to read the text instead you just skipped right to the next choice yeah i bet you did you look like the sort of punk who would anyway what i want to do here is a world first in film reviewing  yes i want to do a choose your own adventure film reviewits pretty simple read both of the options below and choose the one which suits you bestoption 1 i am completely happy and content with my job my partner and my life in general if you answered yes  stop reading this review right now instantly give this film a zero close your web browser and happily go about your awesomely awesome life you smarmy little prick alternatively option 2 my life sucks balls i feel like eating a gun every god damn morning i wake up i am counting the days until i go on a killing spree with an ak47 at my local post office if you answered yes welcome to the fraternity please continue reading this reviewhmmm chances are you went with option 2 didnt you you emo little punkso what is my grand theory well my theory is that if you are content and happy with your life chances are you will absolutely hateinspired by the graphic novel of the same name tells the story of wesley gibson james mcavoy a geny slacker accountant who finds out that not only was his long lost father the worlds greatest assassin but the fact that his father was recently murdered and the organization he worked for now wishes to recruit wesley in order to eliminate the man who killed his father sounds like citizen kane huh notice that i used the word inspired while i havent read any of the graphic novels generally i dont stray very far from the punisher max series the word on the street seems to indicate that the film shares very little in common with the graphic novel aside from the obvious titular similaritiesfirst things first is a leave your brain at the door type of film  leave your brain at the door being film reviewer code for most people will probably think that this is a complete piece of junk but for some reason i kind of liked it the trailers tipped us off to the fact that this was going to be a big dumb overthetop action film wrapped loosely in some ridiculous theme about fate with a couple of gimmicks tackedon to separate it from the herd yeah thats more or less what you can expect from the opening title card outlining a thousand year old order of assassins known as the fraternity followed closely by a matrixesq confrontation between one of their agents and a group of protagonists we quickly realize that any grounding in reality has probably just vanished quicker than a rapper at the scene of a driveby while im not going to give too much of the story away here lets just say that we see our fraternity agent leap through an office building window a hundred meters in the air across the city skyline over to another building at least fifty meters away yep those patrons in the audience that arent familiar with the concept of the suspension of disbelief are going to be in for a rude shockoh and then theres the infamous bulletcurving from the trailer i cant remember the bulletcurving gimmick being adequately explained anywhere in the film but then again there was so much out there stuff going on that i had all but given up on finding logic by that stage i certainly wasnt in the mood to question known ballistic trajectory theory i just decided to roll with itthe main thing that works ins favor is the whole geny slacker angle like i mentioned previously is little more than an average action film with a couple of gimmicks  the element that will ultimately strike a chord with the average viewer will be wesley gibsons potential transformation from a nobody into a coldblooded killing machine wesley is a pussy even by this own admission hes stuck in a deadend job hes flat broke his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend and he cant even be bothered to do anything about it  he has absolutely no purpose in life and he gets to repeat this routine on a daily basis wesley gibson could easily be you or iis it obvious that im trying to delay the inevitable okay im going to have to score this thing soon enoughis an interesting creature i came into the film almost wanting to hate it  i to hate it purely because it looked like yet another overthetop graphic novel adaptation in a sea of overthetop graphic novel adaptations if you boiled the film down into its base components realistically theres not a lot to it but there was just something about the damn thing that struck a chord in me maybe its the fact that im just a nobody like wesley gibson a nobody struggling for identity and purpose a nobody who would happily spend his days banging angelina jolie and doing a little contract killing on the side

i give this movie a 66 out of 10this movie is one for which i had high hopes i saw it as perhaps a new variety of an antihero centric movie or perhaps even a sharp commentary on a mentally engaging subject necessarily offset by explosions and gunfights this movie was as wesley said all of these things and none of these thingsthe premise of the movie is the life of wesley gibson james mcavoy a man who suffers from severe panic attacks and feels he has no control over his lessthanmediocre life his boss is a harpy his girlfriend and best friend are having an affair and his head feels like its going to explode with the load of nothing inside it until he has his life rescued by an attractively dangerous woman named fox angelina jolee she brings him into an organization called the fraternity a group that assassinates targets picked by a mystical loom the fraternity is headed by sloan morgan fox a man who tells wesley that his father had been assassinated through a series of brutal training rituals wesley becomes one of the best in their group in the end he discovers that sloan had been manufacturing targets and that wesleys father had gotten in the way wesley exacts his revenge on the fraternity and is the only one to survive in the endappears as if it is trying to focus of the plight of the average joe the feeling of hopelessness and lack of control that everyone feels at some time in their lives if not all the time this film takes that feeling and tries to make a shiny idea out of it complete with bulletcurving abilities and nearly supernatural reflexes and capabilities for the fraternity members it succeeded in a limited waythe movie does touch on this topic even highlighting in a characterized fashioned consistent with the rest of the film however somewhere between wesleys boss shouting at him and his arrival at the fraternity the story sinks into a simple plot consisting of an average man becoming powerful wesley flies into a rage and kills based on unsupported information from the fraternity when he finds that to be a lie he lashes out at them and kills most of the group for forcing him to kill a father he never knew his mood throughout the film  to say the least  was a tumultuous lashing of curse words and violent gratuitous rage now im all for a character going berserk and superhuman on us just not for a sad excuse for revenge wesley had nothing to exact revenge for his main goal was killing people in order to gain control thats fine but just spit it outthe film pretends to be addressing something deeper than what it really is an appeal to an audience of men who wish they could do the same thing as wesley which is gain power and control not to mention the sweet weapons and the amazing ability to use them it is certainly directed toward a specific audience but it could have been more if the makers had dug just a little deeper into some of the vague themes of the moviein the end i was less than impressed with perhaps more than it warranted because of the unused potential i saw the visuals were impressive as was most of mcavoys performance and the gunfights but the rest was lacking for an antihero movie this one comes up short despite its attempt at a dark tone the movie simply comes across as a temper tantrum thrown by the protagonistat the conclusion of the moviewesley ends up with exactly what he began nothing and he seems not to see that before the fraternity he was a loser with no life and after he is a killer with no life and i answer his parting question of what the fk have you done lately with a question of my own how has what youve done any more important everyone he knew and could have loved was dead or gone so wesley now what,fantasy
this is my first review ever posting on imdb although i read many what inspired me this movie was such a let down i just had to write on it in fact i can say this was one of the biggest let downs ive seen since nothing but trouble in 1991 when with the star filled cast i to walk out of the theater it was one of those movies that you could guess everything that was going to happen next and didnt even care what was going to cause the plot was so stupid and left you no reason to care about the fate of the protagonists whoever they might have turned out to be in this jumbled sht show of benedict arnold like characters the only part of interest was the beginning which would lead one to believe the movie might be interesting and then it quickly spirals downhill the movie sucked flat out i only gave it 5 stars cause the special effects deserve meritotherwise a 3 would have been in order jolies character is just plain boring and morgan freedmen seemed almost and i really mean this almost as if he was making a mockery of himself his character was the same one he always plays wise older black man but this time he he left me saying seriously dont bother watching unless you want to watch just so you can sht blow up or so you see just how badly a movie execs will do anything for a blockbuster that will appeal hopefully to everyone at the end not to be a spoiler but the quote at the last 10 seconds of the movie from the main character was so cheesy i to throw my drink at the movie,fantasy
overalls plot is a halfasses excuse to bring forth another gunkata movie the love interest or relationship between fox and wesley is lowbudget and uncertain most of the main characters archetypal training exercises used to develop his power seemed to lack meaning and congruency leaves the viewer asking questions about the origin of some of the conception and reason of certain organizations in the movie it is understood that this is an action moviei guess action movies sometimes relatively have weak plots and is not necessarily supposed to appeal to ideals but when compared with previous actions movies its plot is sorry o yeahif youre looking for action that is reminiscent of the matrixs youll find it here a little bitnot much though lol despite my seemingly negative review of this movie it is worth watching but only if you get it from blockbusters used section or you see it at your friends and you want to borrow it oh and wesleys attempt at comedy by breaking the forth wall at the very end was lacking irony or clever allusions and it wasnt even funny it its self so in short wesley you fail lol,fantasy
bending bullets  thats precisely what sums it up  the high point of the movie there are certain other nicely done action scenes some of which are difficult to explain in the human world so the explanation was already provided  this streak belonged to a special breed of assassins who inherit the extrasensory powers by birth however they still need to be bodytoned to prepare for the physical duressi read quite a few comments by people who disliked the idea of the movie barring a few who had genuine issues with the plot holes or incomplete explanations most surprisingly had issues with the premise of this movie a lot of it is unbelievable if you look at it conventionally however i must say that so is the premise for spiderman or superman or batman or so many other men and so many other movies especially the slasher or horror genre when you come to watch an action movie please concentrate on the action this belongs to the matrix genre and i enjoyed it more than the matrix sequels most bruce lee and jackie chan and jet li films lack stories but the action is enjoyable the premise of is better than those the idea of the loom is also interesting although it could have been expanded more to suit certain viewersthe bending bullets bit is badly explained however contradicting most viewers i think it is possible if you are into sports like table tennis or cricket bending the ball towards the end of the trajectory is common also in many other sports this is done by adding an initial momentum and direction a spin while delivering the ball ask beckham at a considerable speed the only problem doing that with bullets is that no human could possibly while firing the gun give ones arms a twist so quickly as to provide a spin to the bullet however it was explained that the protagonists had extrasensory powers and could use their instincts  so the question of humanly possibility is killed right there i do agree that this could have been explained better yet it should not kill the thrill that this movie provides,fantasy
the typical story of the weaklingcuckold who matures into the masculine warrior with excessive kill bill type violencelight gore and two brief sex scenes however the character development and story line is much better than a kill bill movie the main character wesley is not the king of his life  not in control and without order nor is he a triumphant lover he is a pathetic cuckold obviously impotent both in and outside of bed a whining unwilling and beaten down masochist he is not wise either because he doesnt work his way out of his problems but rather fate falls upon him he lacks direction in his life nor has a strong father figure signs of no wisdom his inner monologue is throughout the beginning of the movie demonstrating his overbearing selfimportance and self dread he is the symbol of all that is the worst in a man he is an immature boy needing to be matured he is also the symbol of the divine child as he is the son with special capabilities and a royal genealogy of being the best assassins sonthere are two main women characters in the movie in the beginning his obese woman supervisor is an overbearing sadist and represents the typical overbearing mother figure his break from his job and rejection of her sadist relationship is the turning point of his boyhood to manhood im talking about boy vs man psychology  not age yet this is not done without first meeting the seductive powerfulskillful in control fox angelina jolie  a woman who is more of a man than he is the turn on for his own maturitythe immature wesley becomes psychologically tied to the apron strings of fox and is led towards masculine maturity primarily through her as she oversees his training and smacks him around a bit herself so wesley leaves the sadistic fat but distant sheboss and enters a female domination type relationship with seductive tensions and physical abuse from foxs other male colleagues  the fat butcher the bullish boxer and the knowledgeable gunsmithlost in an unknown illusion wesley grows in control in wisdom in becoming a warrior and in being a lover yet he is not fully mature until he overthrows this second mother figure  fox  and this doesnt happen until his finds himself in the true identity of his father now the true father figure introduces true justice and right order into wesleys life this along with his training brings him to be the mature masculine assassin he is king in complete control of himself warrior skilled to fight and energized by order and justice wiseman for he now knows the meaning of his life and a mature lover he loves what is right over the sensual attractions around him he gains the fidelity and selfgiving love of fox in the end of the movie too her character dies as wesley the divine child is resurrected fully realized into the mature man through his selfless selfrisking act of defeating the main antagonist  sloan morgan freemanthis is the story line but obviously being an assassin killing people left and right is not true mature behavior but this is the classical mythology archetypes and plot linesid vote this a 910 for the development of the character but too much graphic violence  who needs to see the back of a head blown openseveral times,fantasy
if youre one of the many imdb posters who hate this movie then i can only assume you have no imagination or youre just too uptight and stupid to appreciate something that dares to bend the rules as has done realism is out the window within the first few minutes of the film which features some very impressive stunt work and some unique twists on typical action shots but this film isnt really about realism its a cinematic treat that takes near orgasmic pleasure in its beautifully crafted action sequences best of all you can actually tell whats going on in the fight scenes there are no traces of sloppy camera work masquerading as authenticity or documentary style filmingthe movie never feels weighted down by its grim subject matter its buoyed by subversive humor aimed at 95 stiffs cheating girlfriends bitchy bosses and the modern emasculated man in fact the whole film is more of a treatise on not being anyones bitch than it is about saving the world by killing peoplei was pleasantly surprised by this movie and sorely disappointed by the closemindedness of a very vocal handful of imdb reviewers i feel sorry for you trapped in your world were everything obeys the laws of physics and nothing makes you sit back and say holy s ive never seen that before,fantasy
first there was a comic book series by mark miller jc jones then a story written by micheal brandt  derek hass then these 2 along with chris morgan devised this imaginative screenplay which was probably inspired by the matrix which was the wachowski brothers inspiration  we know what a treat that waswe now have a russian film director timur beckmambetov making his first english language film he seems to be a very gifted director as it is obvious from scene one that this is a comic book  all credibility  reason must be suspended for the next 105 minutes 10 minutes of credits followwatching this last night i was amazed that i liked this so much i am a senior citizen  we are not supposed to enjoy these action packed thrill rides i thoroughly enjoyed this crazy impossible to believe goings onthe cast is headed by james mcavoy who is besides being very handsome  a fine actor proves he can do an action picture he is ably assisted by morgan freeman who is always goodangelina jolie is more than eye candy hereterrance stamp who still is darn good looking has a nice role as well as thomas kretschman the pianist is as usual excellentthe rest of the cast are basically unknowns but all arr very good i must mention one actress though lorna scott as janice gives in a few short scenes a performance that hopefully will get her more rolesbeing an action film there are many special effectsthanks to cgiimpossible stunts are devised there is one that i must mention a train wreck on a bridge high above a steep ravine that is beyond beliefthere are many scenes where we must suspend our beliefs  just sit back  enjoyit is a comic book come to liferatings  out of 4  88 points out of 100imdb8 out of 10,fantasy
i watched it out of boredom not expecting much else but another action flick with lots of cool visual effects but what i saw was definitely better than what i though it would be though the plot was beyond ridiculous and isnt worth discussing it was still fun if you try to have a sense of humor and i couldnt stop laughing after the very last line you hear coming out of the main characters mouth want spoil it for you but its hilarious i didnt care if the action scenes which made most of the movie length reminded me of other movies they were still awesome and i wish i hadnt downloaded it but instead enjoyed it on a big screen in a theater so if you are fond of these kind of movies the type of tarantinos late brainless creations you might as well like this pile of bull and enjoy it without trying to wrap your brain around the fact that the plot of such an expensive movie sucks monkey balls,fantasy
ive never posted a comment on imdb but thought this movie had to be my first and its not so much the absolutely unrealistic moments in the film such as bending bullets superhumaness etc but rather the inbetween ridiculousness parts of this film which i found so cringeworthy1 the loom that decides fate 2 the bullet that does a perfect full circle and can go through 10 skulls 3 a dodge viper struggling to outrun a delivery van 4 supposedly professional assassins dropping like flies by james oneshot mcalvoy 5 the candle wax recovery liquid but i have to say i did love the movie because it was so terrible and laughable such a shame they used some alist actors though this film deserved exreality tv stars as cast,fantasy
well obviously this film was meant to have rather unrealistic presentation though it would have been nice if we as an audience discovered a bit more about what is the point in these organisationsnow about the characters i personally found there were no good guys i disliked everyone in the film and was kinda hoping every would die at the endthis film also lacked a point like why go round killing people cause a bit of knitting says to do so i mean chavs shanking people for money is more purposeful cause at least they are doing for a purposethe whole spinning bullets thing at first was a bit too odd for me however i accepted the film for being a unrealistic shooter and overall i quite liked all the different stunts usedso basically if you dont care about the unnecessary plot and accept its unrealistic body you should really enjoy this film and i have to admit i watched this the night before i was supposed to go paintballingit did provide me with some inspiration,fantasy
the first time i watched this movie i was greatly disappointed the main char was a pussy trough the whole movie and the ending ended really bad so i have no idea why our hero smiled but alas i realized my view was too colored by the comic book a comic recommended to me by a fellow comic book enthusiast just a month earlierhere is the bad thing with the ending our hero survives and get to kill the big bad guy and smiles but at this point in the story our hero has no money no comrades no job and no girl at this point i would probably go totally max payne on the world hating everything and doing violent stuff against honest criminals moral you could stop taking crap from everybody but know that you will lose everything contrast the comic book our hero or more a villain actually he is way eviler in this version get to talk to his father gets his girl still have friends and more money than anyone could ever wantwell i just watched it a second time this time with friends and i realized that the rest of the movie was okay a bit above average and in the end it proved what we have always known hollywoodlandofblockbusterfactories is still a big bunch of pussies,fantasy
this film is about an accountant who gets selected to join a group of elite assassinslooks cool i like the scenes where james mcavoy kills from a moving train or from a flipped over car and i was thrilled by the scene where a car smashes into the train these actions scenes are rather new and i was pleasantly surprised by them however the plot does not make so much sense bullets with curving trajectory is too surreal to be believed in addition the ending scene that involves many people being dead is plain ridiculous though i think is entertaining i cannot help but think that it is simply a vehicle for showcasing cgi effects and senseless violencein summary is entertaining but not so memorable,fantasy
i went to see this movie with a friend i wasnt sure whether it would be very good since they were giving away so much in the trailers but once the movie started i knew it was going to be good i dont know many other people who saw the movie but it was most certainly worth the price of the movie ticket i cant wait for it to come out on video because i may just watch it over and over i think that the action was amazing it is certainly a movie for people who dont mind some violence i liked the story itself and the main character is most definitely my favorite of them all james mcavoy is an amazing actor i think he pulled everything off really well so definitely give this movie a chance because it might just surprise you,fantasy
i guess some times you really cant tell whats going to hit and whats going to misssomething i need to preface before the review is that this movie was shot basically in my neighborhood in chicago and that reason alone ramps up nerd points imagine angelina jolie running and spraying bullets in your backyard it would be a little more effective than if say shes pelting through the vaticanpreface aside this movie was pretty awesome i didnt come in with high hopes but it really hit home with me i used to have a corporate stuffy job with a boss and accounts and blah blah blah there are tons of better movies out there that better deal with corporate malaise office space but this one felt particularly realit wasnt without its problems the story gets downright silly at some points morgan freemans role is pretty stupid i think its almost a joke hes recycled the old sage role that its time to put a moratorium on him acting at all stick with the voice overs for the next threefour years perfect timing for him to come out with some nelson mandela movie he can probably rock out onthe secondary acting was terrible particularly some dude who plays his friend barry he was terrible and his girlfriend was pretty bad toothe ending is good though angelina jolie is always wicked hot but i can tell shes older than when she was in hackers normally i just cant tellgo see this movie i can go on and on but its enough to say its really good as a gta playing ultraviolence loving white male aged 1835 i can speak for all of us and say it delivers,fantasy
its hard to judge whether is a brilliant masterpiece or a trainwreck off a film the plot which is based on a comic although the similarities end after the first five minutesis simple and potentially great wesley gibson is an officedrone loser with a cheating girlfriend and bullying morbidlyobese boss finds out his father was an assassin for a secret the fraternity an ancient and secret group of killers wesleys father is killed by a renegade of the fraternity and the group recruit and train wesley to stop his fathers killerwhat makes the film so great for me anyway are the weird incidental details thrown into the film without explanation the loom of fate curving bullets and all not to mention the spectacularly over the top action sequences which get so extravagant two thirds in the film completely leaves anything resembling reality or logic behind its almost like ancient mythological story taking place in the present day and i think thats why the film doesnt really work the surrealy over the top mythology doesnt gel with the characterish driven storyline and the film runs out of steam towards the end which isnt helped by an obvious and over used plot twistas for the actors mcavoy is slightly miscast hes great as the loser wesley but hasnt got the charisma for the supercool and lethal assassin wesley jolie is underused a few more lines and better characterisation would have been good and morgan freeman is great as sloan hearing him swear like a trooper and break out of his saintly black guy type is one of the best parts of the filmas mixed as this film might be i defy anyone to watch wesleys keyboardsmashing exit from his job without smiling and theres plenty more to like about it so seven stars anyway,fantasy
lets take this out of the way this movie was never meant to be realistic not even by far is even based on a comicso now that we have that clear we can start talking in context wesley gibson james macavoy is your perfect loser cheated by his girlfriend with his best friend he has a terrible job and an even bleaker future that is until a mysterious woman nicknamed fox angelina jolie reveals some facts about his life that will turn everything he knew upside downwhile the story might barely hold the movie coherent it offers some nice twists and the message it delivers is actually quite coherent the acting is good james macavoys specially and the pacing is greatspecial mention are for the action scenes absolutely none of them are realistic how about stopping bullets mid air with another bullet but that just makes them the more fun and thrilling ones ive ever seen if we thought that after the lobby scene from the matrix there was nothing well check the loom scene at the end of this one it blows any action movie fan mindthe overthetop bulletfest the relentless pace and many hilarious takes will delight anyone who enjoys nonstop action but you must always keep in mind is a movie enjoy it for what it is if you are of those who complains about unrealistic action then save your money and stay at home everybody else go ahead,fantasy

i came into this movie with higher hopes than i left with i was expecting a decent performance based on mcavoys the king of scotland and atonement however this movie failed to live up to those twothere is much selfnarrative dialogue by mcavoy i couldnt help but feel like i was watching a rendition of fight club pitt and norton however the narrative was weak and distractingat no point in this movie did wesley gibson transform into an amazing assassin there were simply two scenes where he successfully kills someonethe fact he killed his dad couldnt have been easier to see comingthe key to this movie is action the fight scenes were fun to watch along with the comedic timing just dont watch it expecting much the music was distracting the characters were unbelievable and the overall direction of the movie seemed to go in circlesgood rental redbox for 1 woot woot dont waste your money on the bluray,fantasy
leaves you marveled by the fine web of its deceptionencapsulating charm so much so that for most of its plot it takes viewers to the height of the plane of believing that they have seen it all and heard it all we have some excellent stunts a hardnosed hero who doesnt believe in the seeminglyimpossible special effects and an endless list of assets which make this flick deserve its share of kudos and leave us gaping in awe we get to see how the boring life of a slacker plagued by tormenting from his boss and other problems help unlock his dormant powers giving way to lightningfast reflexes and phenomenal agility which are made to blossom by fox plot twists and turns moreover are another facet of the synopsis which allow us to get partial wind of the underlying twist present since the very beginning under our very noses for instance when cross tries to rescue our hero when hes on the verge of plummeting to his death from the trainin all a worthwatching action packed film with brilliant acting by jolie which makes it deserve plenty of clat,fantasy
the story is about wesley gibson a loser stuck in a boring job his best friend is fuing his girlfriend but thats all going to change on day he learns that his father was a top assassin belonging to a secret organization that disposes of people who deserve it while being in a convinience store wesley is rescued from an assassination attempt by the the ultra cool fox angelina jolie after that he quickly realizes his destiny and gets trained in all the deadly arts what follows is a thrill ride that contains action that is so over the top that its almost unbelievable but it looks great and is entertainingalso the plot of the movie has a few interesting twists morgan freeman is the only cast member who seems kinda out of place as he is obviously unchallenged by the material he is too good an actor for the insignificant role he is givenaside from that little flaw the movie is almost perfect action entertainment with stunts that make it hard for you to not cry wow out in your theater seat if you like action you will certainly not be disappointed by this moviemy recommendation shut off your brain and go and enjoy this movie,fantasy
i dont think the movie is all that bad it has some nice action scenes and effects it has morgan freeman and angelina jolie and theres some humoron the minus side the movie seems a lesser adaption of matrix and its quite stupid at that the narrator who is a loser is the one the viewers are supposed to identify with we know so because he permanently rubs into our faces that we were losers like him he is then adopted by a gang of assassins whose supernatural capabilities are unexplained and whose motives are explained but more than questionable after he joined it turns out that their idea of employment is basically to beat the  out of him now thats a training that would have made the karate kid a much more fun movie but here its one of the things that made me wonder why lil wannabeneo so desperately wants to become one of them after all they are quite a fascist bunchluckily the movie was too stupid to actually get me irritated by such nasty details so i could at least enjoy the mindless action though theres not as much of it as could be desired,fantasy
all in all this film is a good way to spare some time in cinema it is of course way too full of action slow motion explosions but it is showen in a funny and even acceptable way for all of us who spend their life time in a bureauwhen you go and watch this flick you should not expect to see super action like in dark knight but you will see a movie about a guy who goes out to start a new life i really could identify with the role of james mcavoy in my opinion he did a good jobit is all of course not realistic the dudes in here can shoot around corners but does this have to be bad it is showen in a realstic way or at least in an acceptable way for me as watcher after all i found the effects astonishing and the film is not in 1 minute boringthe ending is a good one it is something unexpected and it shows the main idea of the film that everyone is able to control his own life like he wants thats a good message i think,fantasy
well i went with no expectations at all but i was pleasantly surprisedthe movie is no iron man or dark knight but its a real fun watch with some cool graphicsalthough jolie and freeman are both wasted this is a fun watch if you got nothing to do for two hours and just wanna watch a light flickthe second half is a bit dull and ending predictable but well worse movies have been made in hollywood i dont care what anybody else thinks i had funwatch it on a rainy day or when you just wanna take your mind off this world just dont use your head too muchall in all 610,fantasy
if you want a thoughtful film with depth is not your cup of tea but it is an enjoyable movie to watch it is a feel good movie and perfect choice for the ones who does not want a complicated storyline the story is a simple one the james mcavoy character is a lowgrade accountant with a small office cubicle at a mediocre accounting firm with a boss from hell his girlfriend is sleeping with his best friend he has an all round lack of application he rents a lowly apartment near a noisy railway line and he is the butt of jokes at the work place the fact he does not know yet is his father is a hitman from a secret group called fraternity he is approached and told that his father has been killed on the job and that he has rare talents for being a hitman he is then trained to become a hitman with the ultimate aim of having him avenge his fathers death the training is atrocious includes being able to bend a bullet to hit your target running on top of high speed trains all main characters are doing their parts well i especially like james mcavoy and angelina jolie does not require a full acting ability but at least we know that all players do their part with much effort invites you to suspend your brains for a while and release your imagination if you can do that for about 120 minutes then its a guaranteed fun time  out of ,fantasy
timur bekmambetov is a remarkable director distinguished with recognizable and fascinating visual style yet before his dozor series and a small number of earlier feature films he came to prominence with highly artistic and memorable commercials for the imperial bank in early nineties sadly the bank has later gone bust and those cool adverts were no longer airedwith his latest big budget thrillride starring morgan freeman james mcavoy and angelina jolie he has once again demonstrated his outstanding directorial skills and infinite power of imagination the film is packed with inventive gimmicks plenty of complex visual effects and no nonsense stunning action scenes that may take ones breath away especially when watched on a big screeni liked the filmmakers approach towards localization of the movie in a dubbed russian version adapted for the russianspeaking audience some of the essential textual information in russian like amazing atm touchscreen messages guidances spotted on supermarket posters and even the obscene inscription shaped out of the disintegrated keyboard were seamlessly woven into the canvas of the film no puns intended i wonder why they decided not to replace web interface returning no hits search results with russian version as wellironically contrary to the movie web search engines suggest truck loads of links for wesley gibson the majority however are pertinent to the protagonist of the moviethe film also delivers one big and interesting message many people may live their lives unaware of their true mission on earth and often overlook a chance to expand their real capabilitiesunfortunately the stellar cast exceptional camerawork and visual fx extravaganza are practically the only assets of the film whereas the plot itself in my opinion is reduced to zilch lest to say is pure nonsense even in terms of comic book based moviethe very idea of an ancient knitting loom prompting for the targets of assassination seems somewhat ludicrousgranted they have cracked those damn binary codes and decrypted certain names but how on earth did they guess that those people are supposed to die but not to be awarded with nobel prize or something and going all out just to obey stupid orders from an oracle disguised as a pile of junk im sorry  this is something preposterousthose people entertain themselves by engaging in killing spree just to bury the fact that their own names are compromised who else cares about this tricky arithmetics i know this question sounds kinda silly and inappropriate in the context of such type of even more serious action flicks but i always cant help wondering why the municipal authorities and the police seem to be so unaffected with all this bloody carnage on the streetsallinall watchable and gripping at times owing to outlandish if overthetop action sequences but the storyline is too thin to be fully enjoyable,fantasy
heres what you need to know real fastis a movie somewhat reminiscent of the matrix and die hard movies as far as the action goes it concerns a secret group of elite assassins and a new recruit that get their marching orders from a loom say what yeah you heard me right so were clear the weaving machine not the loon which is a diving bird however since the loom operates like a crazy raffle wherein even the assassins themselves can be targeted you are within your rights if you want to confuse loom with loon my recommendation is that you not think too hard and just enjoy the ride because the movie is entertaining at this point if you have better things to do go do them you have the essentials if not pray continue to read the rest of my crap ermy viewsnow continuing with the loon i mean loom business the assassins apparently dont know anything about their targets beyond a name a face and a location so they have to take it on faith that they deserve to die that the world would be a better place without them as well they must view the kill as an act of fate hmmmm another of my issues was that the powers of the assassins is not in my view adequately explained beyond saying that it is the result of some kind of adrenalin rush that they can consciously control i didnt completely buy that but thats mewhen the assassins get injured they take some sort of healing bath that makes them recover very quickly my question is why not share this with medical science which would do a lot more good than randomly offing people you dont know anything about this brings us to the important question of whether the assassins purpose is indeed to do good or are they blind assassins to which good and bad as we ordinarily think of it is irrelevant finally there is some humor in this movie and in my opinion the best laughs comes from morgan freeman who throughout most of the movie had a dignified urbane and erudite bearing but then he goes street on everybodys ass i dont want to say anymore see for yourself one last thing watch for the clever path of that bullet as it basically says fk you to four people all at once my goodness two birds with one stone is nothing compared to this love boloxxxi,fantasy

car chases gun fights slow motion a protagonist with exceptional yet hidden assassination talents angelina jolies bare backside and morgan freeman as a wise leader figure lets just say that has all the bases covered when it comes to building an action movie hard to argue with that formula and to be honest what you see is what you get this movie is action action and more action thats been injected with steroids if you want substance outside of the overdone choose your own destiny theme look elsewhere seriouslystars james mcavoy in his first blockbusterstyle movie as welsey gibson an ordinary loser accountant that hates his life until hes magically whirlwinded into learning his father was the greatest assassin ever and that he too has those abilities wesley of course learns from the best morgan freeman and angelina jolie as he assumes what he comes to believe as his destinythis film walks a fine line between borrowed concepts and clichs from action movie secret society stories at times you get the sense youre watching something youve never seen before and yet you get this feeling that its all incredibly familiar for example there are some really awesome unique scenes particularly the car sequences and then there are overdone slow motion techniques that firsttime director of an american film timur bekmambetov uses as a result the film bounces back and forth from cool and engaging to overdone and overstimulating so when the film spits this edgy narrative and flashy style at you you either say awesome or seriouslyits easy to say this film is fun cool is a bit more risky because it tries to be a bit too much and usually cool films dont try to act too cool its for sure entertaining and a good kill of a couple hours which is all you need from a film sometimes there are a lot worse action films out there that wont keep your attention but this one does somehow you still are interested in these characters even if theyre a bit hollow gotta give credit though nowadays you dont usually see allformula all the time films come out and get solid reviews its really good at recycling and putting twists on familiar concepts and making them appear a bit more fresh knows which cards to get and how to play them right thats for sure,fantasy
checklist for american summer blockbuster movie listed in order of importance1 hot chicks 2 guns 3 explosions 4 bada heroes 5 save the world plotfollows this formula for summer success quite closely seriously youve seen this movie before if you viewed last years testosteronefest 300 or mr and mrs smith of a few years ago while very similar to both films and countless other summer blockbusters distinguishes itself by presenting its hero as an actual human being the film is also subject to a rather surprising amount of social critique but if thats not your interest then you can still see angelina jolie and james mcavoy slingin bullets and jumping on moving trainsmcavoy plays wesley gibson an epitomized loser he is an accountant for a cleverlynotnamed firm is harassed by his overweight boss and has a girlfriend who sleeps with his best friend he doesnt neglect to remind us of his pathetic life either through constant voiceover narrations one day he is picked up by a seductive yet deadly woman called fox the best name for a character played by jolie after a firefight with an unknown attacker he is carried to a secret base somewhere in the city fox takes him to her leader sloan played by morgan freeman who tells him of a hidden society called fraternity which has existed for thousands of years to assassinate villains fraternity members use the loom of fate which contains the names of evildoers in binary codes of its fabric wesley also has personal ties to fraternity as his father was a member but was murdered by a rogue named cross again such a clever name wesley vows revenge and undergoes emasculating and brutal training and eventually learns his fathers tradefinally he is ready to avenge his fathers death and travels to europe where the traitor is hiding however fox follows him as sloan has given her an order to kill wesley they track down cross who is revealed as wesleys actual father and wesley learns that fraternity has become corrupt which is why cross quit the organization cross was the unknown attacker from earlier and only to keep fraternity away from his son so when wesley returns he goes to the base and kills nearly everyone while looking for sloan when he does find sloan the aging leader tells him that every fraternity members name had appeared in the loom so sloan began treating fraternity as a hit man organization with foxs help wesley finishes off the rest of the assassins save sloan who escapes in the closing sequence sloan goes to wesleys office to kill him but is in turn killed himself from a bullet which wesley fires from his fathers old apartment given that angelina jolie was written into the screenplay it isnt surprising that many thought the film would suffer from the unneeded addition fortunately it doesnt but jolie doesnt offer anything fundamental other than her statuesque body her character doesnt mature much either but fox is ultimately the only fraternity member who sides with wesley director timur bekmambetov also made a good decision and didnt include an unnecessary sex scene while fox isnt developed wesley surely is his characters meek beginning and his intense training are effective in creating a three dimensional hero his humble beginnings also allow us to care about his wellbeing and hope for his success while by no means acceptable in nonsummer months has a satisfactory amount of characterization to accompany its mindless action is timur bekmambetovs first englishlanguage film too his cinematographic approach is unique in this film most of the action sequences have at least some potion in slow motion but not for dramatic purposes as american filmmakers employ bekmambetovs slow motion highlights the trajectory path of a bullet or the movement of vehicle during a chase sequence the style is similar to zhang yimous slow motion arrows in house of the flying daggers its effective in piquing our excitement but bekmambetov overuses it by the films end the slow motion serves to remind us how preposterous the curving bullets and tumbling cars really is a few traditional fight scenes are included such as wesleys fight with one of his old assassin teachers in the kitchen of fraternitys base but they are too sparsely placed a few more noncgi fight scenes would have kept me from feeling ready for the movie to end when i viewed it in cinemathe film also offers some criticism for audiences who arent there for its mindless action in fraternity is a supposedly divine organization which aids humanity by protecting it from evildoers this mission statement doesnt survive into the corporate era which can be interpreted several ways perhaps fraternity has never been the beneficial organization it claims to be or perhaps the malaises of modernity are as destructive as charles taylor argues as for my personal opinion i view fraternity as a visual metaphor for modern religious corruption is viable for such interpretation because it has a stronger source material an acclaimed graphic novel than other summer action films ive not yet read the graphic novel version but i have read that the film portrays fraternity differently than does its source material even so there is still intellectual appeal to the movie which is its greatest assetid recommend viewing in cinema before its theatrical run ends it has enough gutwrenching action to satisfy even the most sober of audiences while the film doesnt directly offer insight into current and historical affairs its wide open for interpretation some imdb posters have already offered such criticism but by the end youll probably be happy to see the blank screen final consensus  out of ,fantasy
if you just sit back and enjoy the movie as a fun summer popcorn flick its not so bad weve seen these cgi tricks before in the matrix but theyre still fun especially when people crash through the windows in slow motion the only time i found the cgi really bothersome was in really wide overhead shots like when theyre running on top of the trains this type of cgi didnt look real in titanic back in the 90s and it seems they still havent been able to improve much on it its nice to see morgan freeman playing a character whos not quite as saintly as the ones hes usually asked to do angelina jolie is also good in this although the role doesnt ask her to do a lot other than watch the training sessions james mcavoy is good as usual and the woman who plays his boss is hilarious its quite the scene stealing role,fantasy

after watching the preview and having a free movie ticket and tossing up to watch the dark knight for a third time i decided to watch as morgan freeman usually takes roles in good moviesis fantastic some of the ideas like a bullet bending may may seem far fetch but the screen play of all the bullet bent shots are fantastic some may say too much like the matrix i say in a different class altogetherthe thing i loved about this movie is that there was no compromise the son to kill the man who supposedly killed his father so he did the fate machine said that all the assassins had to be killed taking there own lives so it happenedthe action scenes are great and heaps of humour last scene is very credible very clever,fantasy
the first time i saw the trailer for this film i have to admit i was a little scared i thought oh no not another poor attempt to make guns look cool when in fact there designed to destroy life well after having seen the film i still think guns arent cool but the future of cgi in film was just given a overhaul and heading in a totally cool direction visually this film was one of the best i have seen in a while i was trying so hard to see where they had slapped in a computer generated version of james mcavoy but was sorely disappointed due to the realistic visuals and effectsborrows heavily from fight club the voice narrative the dry main character and the twisted reality which they where in borders on bizarre and totally crazy at points but thats what drives this film to its full extent its ability to bend the boundaries of reality and create what it wants to do much like the characters themselves jolie is after all one of the most unique woman to face our mainstream cinemas in a long time and is probably one of the first woman in a long time who can deliver as much sexuality into her performances and not be considered a tramp or cheap in todays double standard world also she is way to skinnythe film felt like a series of bad events like a massive stack of dominos that have been stacked up to make a beautiful pattern but with a single breath came smashing down piece after piece it kept your hands white as you clenched your teeth while the action went from one bad thing to another thats what a film should do keep you guessing giving these characters situations which seem impossible to get out off and not ripple the screen with clichs and painful unoriginality not only did the action send your eyes and mind into a frenzy but the sound the sound was continually attacking your ears blowing your mind awaythe plot itself reeks of trying to be different trying something new and exploring boundaries which can be crossed they had plenty to play with and if this film does any better surely a sequel will be on the way any time soon much like the action the storyline was bizarre not so much complex but still gave the audience the chance to not get to lost in the action and noise this film is purely for the senses a feast for the eyes and ears and a word of advice when seeing this film leave your brain at the door and enjoy the ride,fantasy
seeing this after watching the dark knight masterpiece it left me with a feeling of a rushed unfinished plot characters undergo drastic changes too drastic in a too short of a time leaving you confused at times or even surprised that it goes that way this doesnt mean it surprises you for the good it is just an action summer movie that has angelina jolie in it and is making quite some use of itmorgan freemans character just doesnt suit him in the second part of the movie james mcavoy suddenly knows how to fight and control his anxiety attacks after he wasnt able to carry out a conversation with his girlfriendall in just a matter of minutes an obese guy handles knives like a bruce lee with martial artsin a nutshell there was a lot of potential in this movie but it never got going it just has brainless shooting scenes and one scene where jolies back and lower back are seen it is filled with swearings because they couldnt figure out anything to put there and they didnt want to make it look like it was a nosound movie the movie does not leave you with any emotions towards the characters what is does is it leaves you confused for most of it there are much better action films out there better rewatch a movie you already saw than watch this take a collection movie and rewatch it or something or simply go on imdbs top 250 movie list and choose from there dont waste your time on this,fantasy
i really enjoyed watching this movie pretty good acting by mcavoy wesley and his partner in the movie jolie fox but its a bit like a fairytale for kids too many inconsistencies and plot changes and the reaction of the characters is a quite far fetchedwesley learns that his father who abandoned him dies and tries to fit in his big shoes and as the story goes he becomes as good or even better then him at killing peoplethe special effects are really worth the while the story a bit lessi just wish they hadnt made the story so unbelievable as they did but all in all is a fun movie to watch thanks to some great actors and really good special effects,fantasy
wesley gibson works in an office he suffers panic attacks often mainly brought on by his boss janice his girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend in all his life is plain and dull that is until the mysterious fox tells him that his father was an assassin and then wesley finds himself with an organization called the fraternity training to kill the man who killed his fatheris based on a series of comics ive no idea how faithful the movie is in relation to the comic books but as a story it is a bit predictable there are a couple of twists that take place you could see cominghaving said that however it is still a very enjoyable movie james mcavoy as wesley is impressive in his first leading role in a major blockbuster the supporting cast led by angelina jolie and morgan freeman are pretty good even though most with the exception of the jolie and freeman characters dont really stand outhowever the impressive thing about this movie is the style its shot in timur bekmambetov who directed the wonderful night watch  day watch movies brings that style here in some ways it is similar to that of the matrix with bullets swerving round corners or assassins so good they can hit each others bullets however it is very well done and the movie does have some impressive set pieces the highlight for me being the train sequenceunlike a lot of the summer movies it doesnt skimp on the bloodshed when people are shot its rare for a socalled blockbuster to be given an 18 uk certificate and its a refreshing change to see a movie aimed at adults instead of the teen audience as usualas a summer movie it is good with less predictable twists it could have been better,fantasy
its summer and here we have another action film morgan freeman is not usually associated with action movies but fits into this one his latest stint in the much better the dark knight proves this film is not as strong the dark knight proves that while the action in this is good it walks while the dark knight sprints to the finish line the plot spoiler is about a guardian group which has operating for 1000 years assassinating people according to orders from a mysterious source higher up this is enough to hold together the excitement this film has lots of action sceneswesley is enlisted into the group early in the movie after having been told his father has been killed it breaks him out of a dull humdrum office account manager job  into the exciting world of being beaten up  killing peoplehe dumps his younger chick girlfriend for older tattooed woman angela jolie but thats ok as the young one doesnt really seem interested in him but is plenty interested in his friendsoverall the action in this is top notch though you wonder with the car crash sequences how much the gasoline would cost to do them now as i imagine gas was cheaper when this was filmed the cast is ok but there have now been too many summer action films the last few years there is a major plot twist for wesley late in the film but i will leave that to you viewers to find out what that is one good thing is the plot makes sense even though some of the circumstances are a stretch that sometimes seems a go a little too farthis film is ok a good flick for drivein theaters which would fight to see which has more action the movies or the back seats there are a few major mature language bursts but not that many there are a few stimulating simulated sex scenes involving the younger chick  wesleys best friend but they are so brief that is nothing major,fantasy
i dont understand why people are saying its like the matrix its really not the movie has similar special effects to the matrix series but then so do many other films these days there is nothing about computers machines or the end of the world in this it vaguely mentions something about focusing adrenaline to slow things down which is kind of similar the main thing is that people i know that hated the matrix and think it is geeky actually really like this movie it had some very original ideas and effects i think it was still slightly odd and had some parts were i was wondering where did that idea come from it was a good directorial debut outside of russia for this guy i saw the night watch and day watch movies which were also good but slightly confusing in parts as for the matrix the first one is outstanding and groundbreaking in so many ways and this film shouldnt be compared on the same sort of level it is a very good entertaining movie though which is well worth checking out i give it 8 as it has good acting action and effects soundtrack and some excellent original ideas,fantasy
this is not a slapped together movie its carefully laid out and quite effective some of the scenes are spectacular and convincing others a little less so but in general its easily worth the price of admission james mcavoy doesnt seem the type to be dodging bullets but by the end of the movie youre convinced theres a little gratuitous sex in places hardly the theme of the movie but it spoils it for the younger crowd for no good reason really the detailed violence is not so gratuitous but i liked the integrity of the movie particularly in the training sequences theres a nice sense of hard standards displayed that you dont often see anymore ms jolie is not quite the show stopper shes been before but shes still an enormously interesting woman who seems to have a taste for wickedness and vengeance and who you dont want to take your eyes off of really who else could you ask to do her part morgan freeman always adds a little something real as does terrence stamp and both execute rather effortlessly all in all entertaining but almost entirely on the male side of the spectrum,fantasy
the above statement made by my friend best describes the madness that lurks within the recent rise of the number of noholdsbarred ratedr flicks takes center stage here as we experience one ruthless gutsy film that meshes stylistic choices of the matrix the bourne series fight club and even 300 if you enjoy a good portion of unrealistic yet jawdropping action then this is the flick for you however it is not a mindless action movie which it a turnoff to those that want to shut off their brain and enjoy the carnage within is a decent flick full of attitude pain torture bullets and more bullets did i mention the bullets based off a comic book miniseries printed in 2003 follows a lonely stressed highanxiety bottledup bluecollar worker this description screams loser by the name of wesley wesley constantly questions the world around him and his existence but finds refuge during a brush with death after meeting the beautifully mysterious fox fox introduces him to a secret league of assassins with special abilities and there they discover that the son of one of these undertheradar killers happens to be wesley and yes he has the potential to be something big this new change in life has wesley thirsty for more yet the further he plunges into this underworld the darker the motives becomeweve had several lowerprofiled strong action movies in previous years but this one rises above all of them in terms of plot usually an action movie has a simple plot to set the film in motion and the plot never weaves a web of uncertainty and surprises drifts in another direction by offering plot twist after plot twist in the midst of all the action pieces the script wellwritten by michael brandt and derek haas not only gives us a good adaptation of the comic book but also thrusts all these questions about the morality of assassins in the 110 minutes a thinking action movie does this actually exist the acting is also good for a movie of its type the main star james mcavoy hides his accent perfectly and does a good job portraying the tortured soul wesley while angeline jolie seems to have more screen time in the trailers than in the movie itself she also plays her role well jolie will make you drool over her body yet at the same time make you fear her because of her sharp eyes that can crush a soul morgan freedman never disappoints and delivers easily the best line in the movie dont expect it to be mentioned here timur bekmambetov runs the show well by giving us nice long action sequences and by fiddling with the speed of the movie many times the energy presented onscreen more than makes up for the obvious displays of special effects and slower moments in the flickhowever there is a littleknown flick that came out in september 2007 that delivers the same kind of overthetop action except much more of it if you had not seen it then it wont leave you disappointed in but if you did see shoot em up you cant help but get the what if feeling when watching this movie is decent but is structured like an introductory film of a potential franchise much like iron man the incredible hulk spiderman batman begins among others shoot em up offers action only two minutes into the movie could have been something really special if they threw away training montages and exchanged them with more assassinations more insane amounts of action and more bullets bekmambetov knows how to craft a good scene and the best example is the final major gunfight towards the end of the movie prepared to have your jaw drop shoot em ups lack of success can be attributed to no major stars lack of marketing and perhaps bad timingnot because of the quality just like iron man back in may is good but could have been so much better if we hadnt required time for introduction and transition from loser to killer 2 if it comes automatically has the advantage by not requiring backstory or setupbottom line dont let the last paragraph upset you because odds are you never saw shoot em up and odds are youll enjoy regardless but if you did goes by this equation  shoot em up  plot  angelina jolie  morgan freedman  action scenes  intense irony  insane villainbasically is a good flick that sets up what can be one heck of a sequel the director and writers have already proved that they can weave some intense action moments so if the executives are smart they would keep these men around in the meantime this movie is worthy of our hardearned money as long as you are willing to be blown away and entertained yet at the same time think a little earns a 710 from me but a high 710,fantasy
